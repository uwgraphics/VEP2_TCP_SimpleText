SOLITARINESS IMPROVED, In occasional MEDITATIONS upon several Subjects.

LONDON, Printed for John Rothwell.

DAILY Employment for the Soul.
MEDITATION. 1. Upon the sight of a JEW.
WHat have I, or this Man, in Us? that He should be rejected, I received. It
might seem to have been as easy to have kept him In who was In, as to place
me In who was Out. But who dare dislike, what the high Court and Parliament of
Heaven has pleased to enact. Thou art as good (O God) in thy Iusti^ as in thy
mercy. If his fa^ be my rising, the number o^ thy Elect is still certain. ^
see it is more necessary t^ have Jesus Christ our Brother* then only Abraham
to b^ our Father: that covenant o^ Circumcision must be crown^ by that of
Faith. If I have his seat in the Church given to me, who was, and i^ as yet
excommunicate for no^ coming there, Who ca^ or dare accuse the Lord o^ that
Court for unjust: I desire heartily of God to make him my Pew-fellow, let him
see his error, and be joynd to the glorious Assembly of the Saints. God
excluded none who first did not exclude themselves, We all are bound and I do
heartily pray, that all Israel may come In. My perfection and theirs shall be
together, hasten both (O Lord,) and make the Children of Abraham and Christ all
one in the unity of the same Spirit, and the same Faith.

MEDITATION. 2. Upon PILATE, washing h^ Hands.
SEe now this Roman Deputy seems to affect innocence, He will appear to be^
though he will not be a sincere Judge, While he washe^ his hands, He pollutes
hi^ heart; What a vain foll^ was it to dippe in water, t^ swim in blood?
What ^ strange delusion was this* to seem the cleaner, to b^ the fowler.
Outward pretenses may, and are often void of sincerity. Man^ Roman Pharisees
do often sprinkle themselves in Holy water, yet under this wallow in the blood
of Princes, and Gods weaker members, and so many Hypocrites amongst us under
the form of sanctity commit the deepest and desperatest impieties. The worst
complexions, and sordidst natures are deepliest painted. The grosser villainies
have the fairer excuse. That great Imposter when He means worst, appears as
an Angel of Light. We are not to rely upon appearances, I desire not to ^ash
with him, I had rather have a clean Heart and foul Hands, then clean Hands
and a fou^ Heart. Praestat esse quam v^deri.

MEDITATION. 3. Upon the sight of a Toade.
Which of us two a^ of the Ancient^ House? the Earth is our m^ther. This
creature man plead antiquity of nature, of ^ sin. My original Pol^tion makes
this so loathso^ to the sight. I am beholde^ to it, for bearing so patien^ some
part of my burden. B^ nature I am as full of poys^ as It. Every sin is not
only venomous, but mortal. In my corrupted nature, I do appear in the Eyes
of God as ugly as this deformed beast. It would perhaps be better if it could;
I may be, if I will. This creatures deformity comes from me; mine from my
self and Satan. How am I beholden to that God, that did not, though he justly
might have made me so. How am I bound to praise Him, who to make me comely,
lets the whole creature suffer under vanity. Romans 8.

MEDITATION. 4. Upon hearing a Woman (...) die in childbed.
THE unlawful desire (...) taste fruit, made her (...) in bearing fruit. Eves
s^ procurd her suffering. The opening her womb is a p^parative to her grave.
It man well be called a Trava^ when the Mother takes he^ journey out of the
World* I see truly what a dangerous thing it is to conceiv^ and breed sin.
St. Iam^ spoke true, That sin when it is conceived brings for^ death.
Children (I think) have good cause to love their Parents who are willing to
part with life themselves to give it these. How ought we then (O Savior) to
love thee who to give us eternal life was so willing to lay down thine own
life in the grave. And in the case of regeneration, so must every Child of God
do. His body must die wholly to sin, that soul and body may live wholly unto
righteousness, unto glory. The only way to live hereafter, is to die here.

MEDITATION. 5. Upon SAVLS going from Heirusalem to Damascus.
VVHither posts thi^ deepe-learnd Pharisee with such Eagernes an^ Zeal? did
Gamaliel his Tutor ever read such a Lectur^ of bloody persecution t^ him? where
found he thi^ Axiom in the whole Law t^ persecute the Gospel? where learnt he
ever to make Mose^ fight against Christ? Could he so deeply love the Seruan^
and yet kill the Master. Al^ knowledge and Religion i^ any professor is but
zeal blinded without Christ. It may seem strange that the Professors of
Divinity should have such Iarres and so deeply uyed. Behold! the great goodness
of God. In the depth of darkness Saul is caught and compassed with the great
light of a glorious Savior. We are not masters of our own Thoughts, It was a
true speech of Joseph, ye thought evil but God brought it to Good. When we
think many times to do most, we then cannot do any thing. I see it is vain
fighting against the Church of Christ. God does well know how to catch a Sinner
at advantage. Even all things persecution it self works for the good of Gods
Saints. He began his Journey a Saul. But ends it a Paul. So if I be asked
where Saul is, I may safely answer. Is not Saul now among the Prophets and
Apostles blessed for Ever.

MEDITATION. 6. Upon DAVID'S Adultery.
IS it not pity such a Rose should have such a Canker? so fair a face such a
Blemish? But what Saint is privileged with the state of Perfection here? This
fall (as it proved) was but for his surer standing, better heed taking. The
greatest Benefit (I see) that God lends to recover Him, is a good Sermon
preached, and Well applied by a Worthy and well learned Prophet. send (O God)
such always (upon need) in the Courts of earthly Princes. They deserve there
places with reverence, with respect. No Member of Christ can expect a Freedom
from tentation. Our head had his trialls, and those sharp ones too, by that
wicked One. the fairest Sun sometimes meets with Clouds. So the purest
lights of the Church want not their blemishes (O God) let not me so much sorrow
that he fell, as rejoice that he did in time recover. Let me look well to my
self. For I may be sure, that if Satan durst invade such a religious Crown.
He will not spare the weaker subject. The best course to keep out Satan is to
avoid idleness.

MEDITATION. 7. Upon CAINS murdering his brother ABEL.
What? but two brethren in a whole World? and they together by the ears.
What Is the quarrel? for wealth? or honor? the one was not known, the other
not affected. Was it religion? this would have taught Cain love, not revenge.
This was an early persecution, the devil began War betimes; goodness can no
sooner be begun, but it shall meet with opposition. We must not loose our
religion, though we bleed for it by our own brethren; All in a family are not
the children of the same father, Grace is not tied to the firstborn. God may
choose the youngest, leave the eldest. Cain scorns to hate under
bloodshedding. The devil is a murderer from the beginning. Brethrens
div^sions especially in matte^ of Religion are hardly recon^led, But though
this on^ dies, God knows how t^ bring up another, goodne^ shall be sure of
Enemy* but it cannot be utterl^ rooted out. Abell has ha^ abundance of
brethren, Ca^ did not so much kill Ab^ as himself. It is a tru^ Maxim that
Sanguis mart^rum semen Ecclesiae. S. Pa^shall conclude it in thi^ saying. That
he that wa^ borne after the flesh persecuted him that was borne after the
Spirit.

MEDITATION. ^. upon the good Samaritan and the wounded Man.
^Ee how we poor wretches are beset with dan^rs, our life is but a continu^
passage through robbers and ^ee-booters. It Is the safest (...) keep our selves
at home. ^hen we go forth; we ^pose our selves to haz^ds. It Is not every Man's
^ppines to have such a ^npassionate Passenger. That ^n lives safe whose mind
^epes within. A retired ^e has the fewer incon^niences. This Man found most
good at the hands (...) a stranger. A friend is m^ Near then a brother. It
(...) grace not nature, affecti^ not affinity that are (...) sensible and
sympathizi^ of distresses. I see plaine^ that those Jewish cerem^nies are not
so Helpful* (...) the mercies of God in Ie^ Christ, It Is not the Eye (...) the
passenger but the he^ which does good to miseri^* I do desire to keep ho^ but
if thou (O God ^ shall be pleased to impl^ in public, either prote^ me from
these spiritu^ murderers, or send (...) speedily such a comfortab^ Physician.

MEDITATION. 9. Upon Demas leaving Saint Paul.
What a poor conditioned truant was this having such a good master. It was a
miserable sequel of instruction Apostolical to forsake God and go to the
Devil, upon what warrant, did he ground himself to be so suddenly besotted
with the lust of so base a strumpet? Where had he this posture to turn
temporiser? Was it fear of any persecution? What made he then in that
Spiritual warfare? if blows would daunt him? did he suppose the present
world the safer or the s^eeter? why then did he s^ Hypocritically join to tha^
Heavenly Doctor in Divinity* what made he in this Co^ledge if he did not intend
t^ proceed? His non Proficiency (...) an Argument of weakness* And the leaving
of thi^ society, argues enough t^ prove him an idiot. And such is every one
that leaves Heaven for Earth. How many have been, and are sick of this
malady: The natural man's faith, is his sense, and his Present Possessions are
his Heaven. He prefers the things that are seen before those that are not, for
want of faith. I would he had been the first and the last of this nature; I
pray thee (O God) to weane my heart from covetousnes. And since thou have
pleased to admit me into the school of grace, let me so order my affections
that I always may be a Student of that society.

MEDITATION. 10. Upon the two Disciples going from Jerusalem to Emaus.
SEe what may fall out by the may. I do verily suppose when these two began
there journey, they little thought to have had such a good Companion to have
gone along with them. But God takes his advantageous opportunities. There
discourse is political, yet fearful; commendable from the subject, they
talked on; relishing of distrust, from the party they spoke too. Its not safe
opening the Closet of our hearts to every Traveller* we may lend our ears and
our tongues to many whom we will not trust with our hearts. (O God) I do
entreat thee in all places let my words be such as relish of sanctification. In
the high way upon my journeying, as well as at other times, good society makes
tedious things seem pleasant, and is a Whetstone to give an edge to a doubting
soul. Thou do (O Savior) allow us wisdom with the Serpent, as well as
innocence with the Dove: we may safely discourse of thee, but we must not deny
thee: our policy must not exclude our faith. I do entreat thee to take that
advantage of every one that doubts of that high point of thy resurrection, or
his own, as to catch him and confirm his wavering heart in that point of
faith. Lodge thou Oh Savior in my soul, so I shall know thee truly, and rai^
with thee eternally.

MEDITATION. 11. Of a Dog in a Chain
THe malice of this Cr^ture is great, but it (...) wisely limited. His power,
a^ his will are not proporti^nable; though being chain^ he cannot bite with his
te^ yet his barking shows wh^ he would do at liberty. A^mirable is that
divine Pow^ of God limitting, permitti^ that great Dog of H^ when he
persecures by bond^ imprisonment, and captivit^ then he bites sore: when he
slanders, reviles, and envies, then he snarles, and barks only. If God
should not permit this Curre, few would fear his justice: if he should not
limit him, many would question his mercy. It shall be my comfort to know that
my greatest Enemy is at my Fathers disposing: if I be barked at, or sorely
bitten, I know it is his malice, and Gods permissive Will, I will not fear
him, though I will endeavor to shun him. Sennacherib was a whelpe of this
litter, let loose, but suddenly pulled In again; he may be to warn me, not to
worry me: He shall speed never the better though God us^ him. I do not much
grie^ that there is such a Dog^ nor do I much fear h^ breaking loose, being
(...) strongly chaind by such ^ wise master. My prayer (...) God shall be, to
tie him (...) shorter, and I could wish (...) were always musled, b^ Gods will
be done.

MEDITATION. 12. Upon a beautiful and pu^ Virgin.
Who would think^ that corrupted Nature could send forth su^ ^ rich jewel to
the world. How seemly and decently is ^very Part proportioned; that a curious
Tabernacle, ^s here wrought by the will ^f Heaven, how gloriously and richly
covered, while ^any others either want ^his resplendancy, nor counter^eit it by
impostures, and ^aintings, give me that ^all not adulterate; native, ^ot
artificial beauty, No Ague, Aches, diseases, have as yet seized upon, or
impaired her Perfections: Any ingenious and well qualified Spirit desires such
a ^ate. How lively an em^ame is this of our souls, ^fore either corruptions,
or imperfections have tayn^ them. But she does plain^ describe that mystical
Virg^ the Church tryumpha^ which shall be presented (...) her Husband
undefiled, wi^ out any blemishes, sp^ or wrinkles, all her Pa^ keep harmony,
and dece^cy; she shall be gloriou^ molded in immortality, a^ incorruption;
Her coveri^ shall then be the glorio^ Roabes of her Husban^ righteousness.
The Church^ Hypocrites, though now (...) show, and appearance bea^tifull, shall
then prove b^ a strumpet; (O God) Haste^ that day of happy unio^ and let me be
but in the remotest and extremest part of that mystical Body, I shall be sure
to taste Joy and Comfort enough.

MEDITATION. 13. Upon seeing a Man arrested, and carried to Prison.
SEe the power of Law and justice transgressed* That Party broke his bond,
wants Bail, and is fallen into the paws of a mercil^sse Creditor. What can
be expected but a full satisfaction, or else a Perpetual imprisonment. It was
no otherwise (O God) with thy Law and thy Iusti^ by all transgressed, we bro^
our Bonds, and our Co^nants, and so fell into (...) danger of that great jayle^
Satan did plead for a (...) and an execution at (...) Bar of thy Justice,
(...) being sealed turned Serie^ and arrested us. We (...) wanted sufficient
Bay^ and were not able to g^ Satisfaction. This gra^ executioner seizd upon
(...)* But (Oh Eternal Savio^* we are for ever bound (...) love thee who of
thine o^ mercy and free love didd^ rescue us from our Cre^tors hands, by thy
mer^ paiedst the Debt and (...) us wholly free, how Careful ought we to be to
shun all sins, which make us all such desperate Debtors. Oh let me ever
be paying thee with thanks, who to set me free did willingly go to Prison
thy self.

MEDITATION. 14. Upon the sight of an Hive of Bees.
Do not a little wonder ^at this Commonwealth ^f Flies. Every one by his
^oper diligence in particu^r, aduances the riches of ^he state in general.
There are 4. things remarkable i^ this little busie-body. 1. The make no
strangers Deniz^ns* 2. They bring home store o^ wealth but transport little* 3.
They harbor no sluggis^ droanes. 4. They go fort^ well furnished with wing,
an^ sting, for defense, or offense. ^ good pattern for Nation^ and societies
of men, happ^ Republiques where store ^ wealth flows in, but little goes out:
where All are kep^ from idleness, and are well employed, and where ships go^
forth like Bees, that can upon all lawful occasions, eythe^ fly, or fight,
well stored wit^ Ammunition. It Is no otherwise with the soul of a faithful
Christian. It must not admit of strange Gods, or strange worship. It must fetch
in grace by spiritual labor and diligence. It must hate idleness as the ruin
of it is welfare, and when it goes out in her spiritual war, must be furnished
with the whole Armor of God. I do beseech thee (O God) to make me a subject
of this nature, and a Be in this Hive.

MEDITATION. 15. Upon a Man's shadow.
See not this mourning Seruiteur attend my corpse in a Cloudy day, nor in ^
dark night, Nor when I s^ still in a close study. It i^ only my attendant in
the Sunshine, or in the Moonelight, or else in such place^ as are capacious of
bo^ these Celestial Candles. (...) plainly see that flatte^ most follows a
prospero^ state. Parasites hide the^ heads in dangerous occa^ons. A reserved
life v^tuously employed admits (...) such Hang byes. Men wh^ lives, and actions
are publi^ and courteous, are peste^ most with such vermin, the^ do me this
favor, that the^ make the world believe the I am a substance, or else ha^ It.
And this is the state of the soul. What is the world? the Flesh? Wealth?
Honor? but mere shadows, which in perilous times either appear not, or to
no good purpose. He shall be my friend that will be my companion in a storm.
Prosperity gets followers, but Adversity makes the true distinction of them.
There is no trust in such Reeds; for he sung truly.

Quem Dies vidit veniens Superbum,
Hunc Dies vidit fugiens Iacentem.
MEDITATION. 16. Upon the sight of the Rainbow.
THis Bow is bended bu^ without an Arrow, bu^ God has abundance in hi^ Quiver.
He forbeares to punish, not for want of instruments, but because he i^
patiently merciful. I do^ admire the Maker of it, an^ the faithfulness of his
promise, I may well belee^ him, who has kept hi^ word these five thousand
yeere^ and upwards. It is usually seen before and after Rain* when I see it
before, I may expect a shower, not fear a Deluge: when I see it after Rain,
it does confirm my faith, summons my Repentance, and does strengthen my
obedience. Lord thou art willing to teach us by all means, Thou art so
mindful in this, and in all other thy promises, that we may safely take them
for performances. Oh then I pray thee quickly to show that sign of thy Son
coming to Judgment.

MEDITATION. 7. Upon a Winter day.
HOw cold and dark is this season? and how uncomfortable? it is well it is
contracted, and so long a night succeeds, with the hopes of a joyful
Springtide, how diligent is every one to provide warm houses, good clothes,
restorative diet, sufficient fuel for the house. How easily in this do I see
that Winters-day of sickness, persecution, and death: withal, I take comfort,
because they are limited; violent they may be, long they cannot be. Sorrow may
endure for a Night, but joy comes in the Morning, these Mystical floods may
be great, and rage horribly, but they shall pass over me. This pit of death
may be deep, but it cannot shut his mouth upon me: under I may be, above I
shall be. Howsoever my grave shall put a Period to the greatest of these
outward, and temporary sufferings. I know I shall sleep in rest, until the
joyful day of the resurrection, as a glorious Springtime does advance me,
(Lord) I pray thee give me wisdom to provide that Habitation, and Tabernacle
which is eternal, the warm Roabes of Jesus Christ his Righteousness to adorn
me, thy Spirit to heat my affections; So I shall be sure, that though it be
bitter with me here, it shall be sweet to me hereafter, and since this Winter
day shall come, let it not take me unprovided.

Conturbatus mundus, Caelum serenum est. MEDITATION. 18. Upon the Sun.
THis heavenly Candle is comfortable for his light and heat, admirable for his
beauty and motion; necessary to all the inhabitants of the world. He is wisely,
and worthily placed, and he keeps his station, and honorably performs the
will of his Master, he moves not obliquely, but directly in his course. It is a
great blessing when good men are advanced to preferment. When Moses, and Aaron
rule the ship of the Church, and Commonwealth, it then goes safely, stands
firm, and fears not winds, or waves. What respect, and reverence ought the
Magistrates of the Church, and Commonwealth to have of Inferiors. Such
glorious lights ought to be much and highly honored; Our safety and wel-being
comes from them, These keep all the Heavens in an order, and comely motion. It
is a manifest symptom of a diseased Commonwealth, when these are not esteemed:
These ar^ the eye and heart of the bod^ politic. All inferior members
receive comfort from their wisdom. Learn (...) (Oh God) a quiet
subordin^tion and a conscionable su^mission to these wor^ lights. I see the
Sun gi^ heat to all. Gods blessin^ are not to be impropriat. H^ that gives to
others she not have the less virtue (...) Himself. It is usual for (...)
Candle to light up anoth^ Bonum quo communius, eo me^

MEDITATION. 19. Upon the sight of a Brave new House without Land or Means to
it.
I Suppose that stately edifice was situated there for pleasure, and health,
But I neither see good furniture within, nor proportionable means without to
mantaine (...). It has nothing but a ^re prospect to move envy, ^d high
Turrets to show the Pride of the owner, and to expose it to storms, and
winds, when as yonder little Cottage close (...) seems poor and base
without, yet is admirably well furnished with Olive branches within, to comfort
the two aged Parents.

How plainly do I describe beauty, and outward comelines, without any
endowment of the mind* always the fairest face has not the soundest heart*
outward perfections are no^ a general argument of inward goodness. The Caske^
may be fair, and gilded* yet have poison in stead o^ pearls within it.
Natural parts at the best are bu^ mere blemishes without Grace.

All is not to be truste^ that is fair in show, prid^ and ostentation may
please the passengers eye. But give me that little low grace of Humility, I had
rather not seem, and be rich, then to seem, and not be so. The one is close
retiredness with content, and safety. The other is only empty formality with
inward vexation.

How many Pharisaicall professors are fair, and pleasing to the eye, yet
rotten at the soul. May I ever profess the power of godliness, and not strive
only to hold the form of it. Real performances of good duties are that which
God looks for, not fai^d and counterfeit seemings, ^e one are but high clouds
without water, the other Wels full of lively springs. Give me an humble heart
full o^ grace, so I shall be satisfie^ when they shall be empty* and shall
have a sure cornerstone, when they shall moulder to rottenes.

Respicit Deus Humiles, reij^ Superbos.
MEDITATION. 20. Upon the sight of a Butche^ killing a Lamb.
I Cannot but think (...) that saying of St. Pa^ The creature does groan
under the bondage of corrup^on. How meekly, and patien^ It submits to the
Knife. At sight of this, I may say, Ecoe Agnus Dei, who so quietly suffered all
the injuries offered him, and as a sheep before the shearer, so opened he not
his mouth: His adversaries were not so violent, and eager in their thirsting
for his life, as he was ready, and willing to lay it down, and whereas they
thought to conquer him by malice, he did conquer them by meeknes, and mercy.
How different was thy desire from theirs, Thou (O Savior) came to give them
all ^ernall life, and they hunted ^ith bloody wills to take a^ay life from thee.
I see al^ the lot and share of all thy holy ones, They are Tanquam oves, and
Agnelli. They are but counted as sheep for the slaughter: Oh Butcherly an^
bloody world! will not the blood of that One satisfy the madness? must thou
need^ swim in the blood of h^ poor members also? persec^tion even to death is
the p^tion of Gods children. The head has suffered, and (...) must all look
to follow: (...) that will live godly in Ies^ Christ must suffer persecut^on:
(Oh God) learn m^ courage, and chearefulnes in (...) trials, for thy name
sake, f^ I know this, if I suffer wi^ thee here, I shall rejoice wi^ thee
hereafter.

Per Crucem Itur ad gloriam* MEDITATION. 21. Upon a Door, turning upon his
Hinges.
THis is contented with its own motion. It turns backwards, and forwards
constantly: sometime forwant of Oil it skreikes, and makes an unpleasant
noise; but it will not be gotten of from that motion without violence.

In this see the sinner Habituated and accustomed unto ^ill courses, can the
Black^ore change his color; or ^e Leopard his spots? then ^ay he that is
accustomed to ^ill, do well. How he winds himself from one sin to another,
but ends in the same Center. Sometimes wear^ with the motion in one wickedness,
he turns to another* but his whole life is nothing else but a gally-mophrey of
a^ sins, he moves as in a circle, from ill desires to cov^tousnes, so to
usury, so on t^ oppression, then to exactio^* then to grinding the faces o^ the
poor, and at last eats up Gods people, as if he would eat bread. His
remoueals a^ but from one evil to a worse* and dies in the highest strain^ of
all impiety. But perhap^ his conscience now and the^ gals him with horror. The^
Satan oils him with some new pleasure or profit, an^ so keeps him either as
fast bound or faster then before. There is little or no hopes of his ceasing,
unless it be by the strong Hammer of Gods Word preached home to his
conscience. Let me (Oh God) hate and leave all sin, least I be too soon
accustomed in any. I pray heartily that none may bind themselves Apprentises to
that unlawful Trade.

Consuetudo altera Natura. MEDITATION. 26. Upon the sight of a Sword.
THis defends our persons, and offends our Enemies, use makes it bright. Upon
some occasions the scabber^ is either the best, or worst plac^ for it; It Is
terrible in the hand of an expert Warrior* Many should use it, who ye^ for
fear, or favor, or both, le^ it rust. Three sorts of me^ ought to use it
discreetly, the public Magistrate, the So^dier, and the Traveller. It also
shows me the nature o^ that spiritual word of truth* which is the safest
Buckler, and shield for our souls, and bodies, in all conflicts and combats,
destroys all the power, and Armadoes of that Prince of darkness; the oftener
it is used, the more excellent it is. The mouth of a diligent prophet shows
the Energie of it. They do ill that debar the use of this weapon to Gods
people. It Is ill when 40000. Israelites can scarce have it, or use it rightly,
but it is worse when the Magistrate will not, and when the Prophet cannot handle
it.

Lend me courage (Oh my Savior) in my calling and this weapon. So I need not
fear the malice, or multitude, faces, not forces of those presumptuous
Philistines. Teach thou my Hands to War, and my Fingers to fight, then I need
not question the conquest. If I perish, it is mine own weakness and
cowardice, not the insufficiency of the Instrument's.

Diabolus Hostis,
Scutum Christus.
Verbum est Gladius.
MEDITATION. 23. Upon a virtuous Wife, havi^ many Children.
It Is not Every man's happiness to enjoy such a blessin^ without fruit, how well
is (...) with him that has g^ administered to him in suc^ plentiful, and rare
Models* ^ am persuaded that her hu^band fears God: For she (...) promised a
portion only (...) men of that qualificatio^* He need not fear his Enemies,
because his Quiver is full of these Arrows. It Is well when goodness
multiplies, such Seed cannot be sown too soon, nor spring up too fast.
Sterility is fittest when the womb is not holy. God threatens to give dry
breasts, and barren wombs as a curse to sinful, and disobedient Husbands.

Thy Church (O Savior) is as this virtuous Matron well stored with Daughters,
and Olive branches to adorn the Courts of that new Jerusalem, in her Husbands
Absence how she mournes, how lovingly and patiently she desires, expects, and
prays for his coming, how prudently she governes her family? and how
carefully does she provide for there diet, and sustenance? And just so it is
with thy Syon, Thy long absence makes her seem as a Widow, and how earnestly,
and often has, and does she pray for thy second coming; and ^ as one of her
youngest sons do cry and pray to see my Fathers presence* Come Lord Jesus,
come quickly.

Ecclesi^ ut Spousa,
Christus Sponsus.
Math. 23.5. MEDITATION. 24. Upon the sight of a Grasshopper.
WHere does this Summer singing Soldier, take up his quarter in Winter time?
No man can know from whence he marches, nor whither he retreats. Thus much we
may learn, to be obedient to God, for here is an Army of potent Soldiers
ready furnished to punish where their Lord commands. God has 4. Regiments of
such forceable destmiers, the Locust, the Palmer worm, the Canker, and the
Gras-hopper; These have been always found able and willing to execute
judgment having had their Commission. But what strength or pow^ can reside in
these poor little Worms? or what weapon are they able to manage? as^ all
Egypt, and it will tell yo^ with amazement.

It Is good to keep in pe^ with God, least he arm (...) Creatures against us.
G^ can, and does bring great A^tions to pass by small, a^ weak Instruments.
All h^ force enough when He i^ploies them. The Fly, a^ Worm are as able as
the Ly^I*

Its not so much to que^on with what a man is pu^shed, as to learn from wh^
and whence it comes, I w^ (Oh God) acknowledge t^ power in all thy creatures,
(...) thou make me an Example of thy Justice by the least, for despising
their seeming impotencies.

Non in quantitate, sed qualitate virtus.
MEDITATION. 25. Upon the sight of a dead Man.
TEach us (Oh Lord) so to Number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto
wisdom, for so soon pass we away, and are gone, All flesh (I see) is
Grass, and all the beauty of it is as the flower of the field, Thou (Oh God)
have determined the number of our days which we cannot pass. See what
follows the separation of the soul, and body. As long as this Tabernacle
lodged the soul, It was sensible, active, could hear, see, speak, or move,
now that guest is driven forth by the Maker, there is nothing in it, but breeds
loathsomeness.

I plainly see that all confidence in man is vain, and deceitful, we must
all dye for sin, but keep me from dying in sin, since I must dye, let me
end in grace, not in nature. I descry the natural man's unfitnes for any
spiritual exercise, what can he perform without Christ? And as the body is
dead without the soul, so both soul and body without grace, Oh let me always
be as a dead man unto sin, so this death shall end in life, and this
dissolution shall be the only means to have both happily, and gloriously
united.

Mortuus peccato, vivus Christ. MEDITATION. 26. Upon the sight of a Lottery.
HOw cunning the world is to deceive the world? here are a thousand Blankes for
one Prize. The World deals all upon cheating, It Is thousand to one if any good
man gets any good by i^* from it, or in it. See what ^ throng is here, Every
man strives to be first to cheat* and deceive himself. I do^ see places of
more profit, an^ pleasure stand empty.

The world has mo^ Clyents then the Church, w^ cannot conclude the great^
company to be the be^ Goodness cannot be just^ numbered by the Pole. The^ is
more Earth for the Pott^ then for the Goldsmiths. I^ no safe argument to follo^
the multitude. Every o^ that draws hopes for a pri^ but he that hopes to be ^
Winner in this world, shall (...) a Looser.

The folly of the worldly man's wisdom is here easily seen. Here he will
willingly cast away Pounds upon uncertain hopes: but in Gods Lottery the
Church, he will grudge his farthings, nay his presence; Yet here he gains
time, and saves his estate, there he looses both. (Oh Lord) I beseech thee to
give me grace to come to thy Storehouse, where I may furnish my self with
rich commodities at a low rate. I need not fear to adventure, for all that
comes from thee advantageous.

MEDITATION. 27. Upon a great Candle in a fa^ Candle stick.
HOw comfortable, ho^ comely is this? a^ how wisely is it placed. It Is pity but
such ^ Candle should have such ^ seat, and such a Candle-stick^ deserves such a
Light. The^ is not any but affects it, if h^ be well disposed.

How easily do I in the see a good, and painful Preacher, well, and wisely
placed i^ a good Pulpit. His Doctri^ is no less comfortable, the^ convincing.
My Prayer sha^ be that every such light may have such an Eminent Preferment.
Those whose lives, and Doctrine are both holy, and sanctified are indeed
burning, and shining Lamps, and do grace the Temple, and Gospel of Christ.
Let me (Oh Lord) be but even a little Candle in thy Temple thus qualified, and
I cannot dislike my place, nor doubt of Acceptance, and Approbation with thy
Saints.

MEDITATION. 28. Upon a dead Coal.
Why this sooner extinguishd then another? or why at all? Ca^ that heat, so
suddenly, an^ totally vanish from the subject? or being dead is it not (...)
be revived? It Is manifest tha^ remoteness, and solitarine^ makes it die. But
joined (...) the whole Company ho^ soon recovers it the form^ virtue.

It Is no otherwise with t^ Elect Children, want of go^ exercises, and Company
man abate, and lessen their hea^ of zeal, but thou will n^ suffer it to be
extinguish^* Satan by policy may cau^ some remissenes, but he she not procure
absolute dea^nes. Graces in the Act are n^ always so sensibly operati^ yet the
habit may remain firm. The Sun may be hid with clouds, but we know It does
then move in his Orb. It Is not a mean blessing to enjoy the company of Gods
Saints, who are not only warm in Grace themselves, but also make others so to
be.

MEDITATION: 29. Upon seeing the Sun setting.
HOw glorious, comfortable, and pleasant was his light, this last hour? now
how dark and disconsolate is the Heaven, and what a sable Mantle spreads over
our heads, and how are the Earthly Inhabitants Canopied in Darkness.

How does it shadow out the uncertain condition, and frail estate of the
greatest Monarchs, and the mutability of all worldly luster. Scepters have
their periods, and the greatest honors, and preferments their appointed dates,
Nothing under the Sun but is subject to setting.

Just such is the case of the body without the soul, and such is the state of
the soul, without Christ, miserable, uncomfortable. I entreat thee (Oh
Savior) never to deprive my soul of thy presence, but let me always be
comforted with the light of thy countenance, so I need not fear the darkness
of the Grave, nor that of Hell, being always in thy presence, who art that
Light, and that Sun which never sets, or changes.

MEDITATION. 30. Upon a Stone in a River.
HOw unmovable, obdurate is this, though the waters are about it, above it
continually. It changes not the form, seldom the place, and is absolutely
unfit for any building, or necessary Employment, when as other^ that are
heavier, and greate^ then it, with a few drops o^ Rain only, are mollified,
receive impression; are square^ and fitted for many excelle^ employments.

I cannot but behold (O^ God) the several condition of sinful men, some are
s^ desperate, and accustomed i^ wickedness, that neither the often showring
down o^ mercy, nor judgment w^ work any thing upon the^* such Pharaohs are
they i^ self-will, perverseness, custom^* These are settled upon the^ Lees.

Others though heavier, a^ more laden in sin, yet wi^ one drop of mercy, or
at the first shower of punishment, relent, mollify, and so, are sensible of
their miserable condition, and are often fitted by the Goodness of God, and the
Ministry of a diligent Preacher, for excellent uses in his Church. Keep me
(Lord) from hardness of heart, and insensiblenes in sin, let my soul be
mollified by thy mercy, and terrified by thy judgments, that thou may employ
it in some service for the glory of thy Name, the example of others, and the
comfort of it, at that great day of Reckonings.

MEDITATION. 31. Upon the ill, and neglige^ Servant, Mat. 25.27.
HE ought to have put his Masters money to the Exchangers, but did not. Why not
he laboring as well as his two other fellow servants? Where was he privileged
to be idle, while the others were working? why not he performing his duty
though others were careless? he shall answer for himself. It Is dangerous
sinning by example, or pattern^ of others, but this man sinned against precept,
and without pattern: and I fear has folly made himself a Pattern, and
Example to others to sin by. It is bad to follow wickedness, but it is damnable
Impiety to lead others. That seems to be one aggravation of Ieroboams
wickedness, That he made Israel sin, what excuse can this idle soul make? will
he plead ignorance? or impotency? not so: His conscience galls him there, what
then? was it a suspicious fear of loosing? he know this way of managing it,
was the only warrantable, and advantageous course, this was one principal end
why he had it bestowed on him, out see how impudent he is in a lie to his
masters fa^ I knew thou wast an ha^ man, etc. While he (...) ashamed to father
his fa^ himself, he villanously see^ to disgrace his Lord.

I see thus much that man a wicked and ungodly wre^ may be under a good maste^*

VVithall that many ^ wicked man has had fa^ means of salvation lent hi^* The
only way to be cro^ hereafter, is to be Dilig^ here: It is not the enioy^ of
the means, but the (...) employing them that gi^ Happiness. I may read (...)
Lecture to my self, and (...) other Ministers, and One (...)Gods people. That
the ri^ and constant excercising my calling is best in the Royal Exchange, The
Church. That those which are Gods Factors for souls must employ themselves in
this place. And for the people, that the only thing that will give content to
their conscience, and that will be approved of GOD, is to turn there Talent
of Hearing into Doing.

MEDITATION. 32. Upon the Soldiers that watched the Sepulcher of our Savior.
What a stir is here on all sides? The Priests, the elders, and S^diers all
plotting to she themselves. The first f^lish in their Command^ the second
Corrupters, a^ base by bribes of money, (...) third careless, and suborned (...)
on so high a point of ^uice. What a folly was (...) to watch him, who did wa^

But how many ha^ wages of unrighteousnes corrupted, and spurd on to bad
services? Bribes make wise men purblind, shipwreck Conscience, and truth. It Is
a clear case for the Conscience, that Rewards are not to be taken then, when
Gods glory, and truth must be declared.

Yet seldom has it been ^owne that wicked men ^ve wanted Assistants for ^ere
worst intentions. Liars (...) well furnished for the ^st part with Excuses.
Sup^ters of truth as they are ^lyticians, so they are well ^red with
Instruments. Re^lion seldom marches with^t Accomplices. The Execra^st murders
as they have had their Plotters, so they have found Undertakers for the
Execution.

Lord I beseech the^ keep me from withho^ding the truth in a ly^* Let not

MEDITATION. 33. Upon the Ethiopian Eunuch converted by Philip.
THis noble Courtier took good pains to take so long a journey to go to
Church, and it did please God to reward him well go^g Homewards. The Church
(...) the most likely place to be ^essed in. He made the rea^ng of the
Scriptures as a pleasant History, though the virtue, and the mystical meaning
was as yet hid from him. He was neither idle, ^r ill-imployed in his Journey.
Reading is commendable, especialy of such things, as may make for the bettering
of us. Upon this see how God salutes Him with an Occasional ^ing'd Preacher.

God knows the Opportunities to work upon us. Philip must join to him, the
he may be joined to God.

I read not that this Great Lord Treasurer in his Coa^ disliked this Preachers
coming, nor yet the seemi^ bold question that he pr^pounded.

I see in this Religiously ^fected Nobleman good D^sires and good Motions t^
know, and also God seco^ding his pious Endeavors a^ works his happy
conversion. It Is no small blessing to enjoy the company of a faithful
Preacher. We cannot suppose what great Things God may bring to pass by these
too much despised Ambassadors.

It Is not every one that can expound Scripture aright. But here was one that
rightly divided and applied the word of Truth, and see the operation of one
Sermon preached effectually.

God send every true Beleiver such a man to meet him, and bid him deliver his
Heart to God: these two met well, and parted better. Their salutation ended in
salvation. Let me upon a^ doubts light upon such a^ Expositor, and be store^
with such a Commentary.

MEDITATION. 34. Upon seeing a Bird caught (...) a Snare.
HOw Agile, swee^ framd, beautiful, a^ Pleasant, was the pretty Quirrister,
before (...) was thus captived; now, h^ heavy, mourning, and disco^late is it:
having not on^ lost her freedom, but ^pos'd her self to open ^struction.

The use of liberty without wantones is a pleasant blessing: but aiming at some
unlawful pleasure, or profit, proves dangerous to the Enioyer. (O Lord) it was
the soul of Man that was thus beautiful, pleasant, pure, and active in the
state of Innocence. What a spacious liberty had it either for Exercise, or
Recreation? but being enthrald by that too too cunning Fowler, by the snares,
and traps of sinful pleasure; How heavy, how irksome, and how loathsome is
it, even to it self?

Sin makes us loose all our spiritual mirth, and liberty, and exposes us to
manifest perdition. (Oh God) since there are so many snares, and politic
fowlers. Let my Soul, keep Above and not settle here Below, so I shall escape
their devises, and preserve my own liberty.

Columba est Anima, Auceps e^ Diabolus.
MEDITATION. 35. Upon the sight of a Thorn Tree, full of Blossoms.
What makes thi^ growing, and flourishing in so good a piece of Ground? It
does deserve a fire rather, then such an happy Situation being naught in it
self, and choking the good Seed. It Is well when wickedness is barren, better
when it is quite rooted up, (may some say.)

But I admire thy patience, and thy wisdom, (Oh God) even toward these
vessels of wrath. It Is thy will, and wisdom to place them here. Who dare then
question thy Action for unjust? it stands here either for an open conversion,
conviction, or confusion.

We must not be our own sharers in our Petitions. All is not best that seems
so i^ our desires. We should revenge either too hastily, o^ two deeply in our
own, o^ our friends wrongs. Thy L^ly was troubled, and the own Israel was
molested by these, yet both by thy Permission. (I believe they sha^ have a hot
day of it when (...) comes.

I envy not the felicity o^ the wicked, but patientl^ wait to see thy wisedo^
manifested. We are bu^ foolish Logicians, if we conclude hapines from
temp^rall blessings, the wicke^ may surfeit with them, an^ thy Elect want them.
Le^ them grow where, and (...) long thou please, I believe thy words, That
the wicked shall be rooted out at the last.

MEDITATION. 36. Upon visiting a Rich man, in time of his sickness.
What resorting to His house, by kindred, friends, and Neighbors? He wants
not their company, Council, or help: when as an honest poor man may lie long
enough under a tedious sickness, and have no such Visitants. They come for his
Goods, rather then to do him any good. much like greedy Gleaners when the
Corn is cutting down. He makes his will against his will, settles his state,
assures all for the World. At last sends for a Preacher, who finds him
unfitting for God, or the World.

Sickness, and death (I see* are bold and impartial Ser^ants. The World, and
wealt^ are but poor Bail upon deaths Arrests. All meane^ are nothing when God
strike^ us. The wisdom of the worl^ is but an (...) for Heaven.

The Rich are unwilling t^ dye because they know no^ a better life, and want
fai^ to believe it.

Wealth, and riches often are but Percullisses let down to stop the passage
through the Gate to salvation. Rich worldlings have Gods Word in least, and
last consideration.

So let God order me, that in all estates I may be ready to part with All to
enjoy Him. But it is truly spoaken, Oh! How bitter is the Remembrance of death
to a man in his full possessions.

MEDITATION. 37. Upon Hearing a fair Ship come home Richly laden.
What dangers thi^ Poor Vessel hat^ passed? what Rocks, Pirat^* Sands,
Waves, and Winde^ has it encountered with* What hunger, cold, heat, an^ blows
has she endured* What a green, tedious v^knowne, moveable way hat^ she
flowne over? What ^ world of water has she plo^ed through? With wh^ strange
Nations has she^ traded? And yet what more is, how often has she been^
reputed and given for lost* Yet safely at length arrived with Drums beating,
Trumpets sounding, Colors displayed, and rich Prizes in Her. GODS Name be
praised.

Every son of man comes into, and goes out of this world as a Ship to Sea.
What miseries, afflictions, calamityes, poverty, disgrace do encounter them?
Happy is he that keeps the Vessel of his soul by Patience to the End. Many
split, and sink, some are taken Prisoners, others die with hunger. All are
liable to Combats, and fiery Trialls.

More specially I think of, and pray for that Royal Ship of thine (oh
Savior) called the All Saints, o^ the Church militant. Which has beeee long
forth, hat^ endured Heavy things, ye^ (as I hope) shall ere lon^ put happily
into her safe Harbor of rest, and repose.

What rejoicing, an^ gladness shall there be a^ Her approach, which come^
laden with so many thousands of pure Souls to be^ put into that Royal
Exchange. Fetch home thy Syo^ (Oh Lord) and thy R^deemed one with much people*
Let me be any Prize i^ her, and I shall be rich enoug^*

Ecclesia Navis est,
Animae piorum sunt Mercat^
MEDITATION. 38. Upon the sight of an Infant fed with Milk.
IF it were not for this kind of food the poor Infant might starve. See how
God proportions to all Nourishment sitting there Age. How quietly you may see
him receive it? How kindly the Nurse giving it? How (...) agrees with his
tender Con^ution, and digested, fits him (...) stronger diet.

How does (Oh God) thy Heavenly Wisdom appear, in giving us sincere Milk
out of thy Heavenly word. While we are babes in Christ, how meekely does the
thriving Child in Grace receive it, which is able to save his soul. How
lovingly do thy faithful Ministers feed him with it; an^ being rightly
received, make^ him grow up unto the perfect stature of a Man i^ Christ.

God is careful to provide food for man's soul^* The Preacher ought to be
d^ligent in the distribution (...) it, and the hearer ought (...) be constant
in the receipt (...) it.

Children that will not r^ceive Milk, either sicken, die, or else prove Dwarf^
Seeing (Lord) it is uncomely, unnatural, always to be a Child, ever learning,
but never coming to perfection. Let me so receive thy Word that I. may grow
from strength, to strength, and from virtue, to virtue.

They are unnatural, and unfiting Nurses, who either do not give Children
Milk at all, or else adulterated, and sophisticated with many dangerous
Ingredients to hinder their growth.

The first are careless, and unlearned Ministers: the se^nd are superstitious,
and ^olatrous false Teachers, who presumptuously mix their human Traditions
to Gods Word, hindering the growth and increase o^ Gods Church.

Gods Word admits no mixture; it is desperate boldness either to withhold it, o^
to add to it, being first, so necessary: secondly, so perfect in its nature:
Both wi^ undergo that heavy cur^ of God, the one for Substraction, the other
for Addition.

MEDITATION. 39. Upon the sight of the Moon.
THis Creature is now in the full luster, in the revolution of a few days, how
is the beautiful light of it diminished, because it is not of, or from it
self, but borrowed from the Sun.

That is absolutely perfect whose subsistence is in it self. That body is but
imperfect whose Fundamentals are External dependances. Those Princes are
counted weak, whose Forces are borrowed from their Neighbors. Miserable is
that man who^ His necessary imploymen^ must have a Leg from o^ a Hand from
another, a^ an Eye from a third. The party dares not diso^ him, by whose power
h^ Head stands on his Sho^ders.

Seldom do they accomplish any great Actio^ whose Materials are oth^ men's
Beneplacits: To bor^ another man's faith to g^ to Heaven, would seem b^ the
Errand of a begga^ Christian.

The body of the Mo^ Increases, and Decreases, (...) our sense, it is as subj^
to change, as it is to (...) motion, If Philosophy will serve for an Argument.
Man's mutable state of his body sympathizes, or else is caused from it.

But how soever it is no such mervaile if men be unconstant, faulty, and
fading, since those more Caelestiall, and Superior creatures stood not all
steadfast, The Angels kept not their first Integrity. Worthy Cal^ has it, Si
peccare norunt ^arentes in paradiso, quid mi^um si Nos in sterquilinio?

It is (Oh Savior) with (...) souls, as with the Moon, ^ee has light only
from (...) Sun. The light, and ^re we have in our souls is thy comeliness
and bea^ty. We are darkness, but the have made us light in (...) Lord. Let me
(O Lord* cast away now the work^ of darkness, and put vp^ my soul the Armour^
of Light.

Lux mea a Te. MEDITATION. 40. Upon the falling of (...) in Autumn.
What a strange a^ration is here in t^ Tree? The last quarter h^ flourishing?
how repl^shed? and decked with the sands of Attendants in green, promising
much to the satisfying of the beholders, but this was in Summer.

How many such seeming Parasites are there, which will spread Sail with us in
a fair gale of Wind, or in a prosperous term, promising fidelity, but in the
tempests, and violent storms of adversity, or affliction are suddenly gone
with a Non Novimus. Few men make haste to that Market where there is nothing to
be bought but blows.

It shows also to (...) the frail condition of the body, and worldly
preferments, how beautiful, and comely has this man been and how honorable
this day, when suddenly but one fit of a fever, or one frown of a Prince
has lopt both in a moment. Suddenly have such Meteors, and Comets been
extinguished* God make me so resolute in perseverance, that I may hold my
first love. So neither the heat in Summe^ shall make me too proud* nor the
frosts in Winte^ affright, or displace me.

MEDITATION. 41. Upon Reubens divisions. Judge. 5.15.16.
I wonder much, and grieve more at this unmatchable separation. Can those
hearts which should always be united, in so small a distance be divided? was
it any discontent that this Tribe harbored because it lost the privilege of
the first borne? Indeed lawful Heirs seldom part with their Prerogatives,
but threaten revenge, or intend it to the present possessors with Esau, could
not the Equal Testament of a father so inspired be admitted for just, in (...)
many Generations, Without malice, or revenge.

This had been a fair opportunity for Reuben to ha^ gaind that honor in the
fie^ which he lost in an unlawfu^ Bed. Was it because D^borah a Woman was then
the General in the Field? An^ so Reubens Regiment scorne^ to be led up in
Arms b^ so weak an instrument? bu^ certainly he was then the more culpable,
being (...) potent a Tribe, and abse^* Will he put the fault (...) Jordan
because he could n^ Pass over his high su^ Waves? Oh no! A willi^ mind
slights such poor ^cuses, and will affront the greatest perils.

Was it the force of the Enemies Army that affrighted him, or did he think he
should come too late? For the first, he could not have hazarded his life in a
fairer quarrel, nor amongst nearer friends, and if he had come, though after
the Battle, no question but Deborah, and all the Lords would have been glad
to have seen his Colors in the Field to triumph, though not to Fight. It
would have showed a readiness, and propensity of mind, and would have made an
Apology for his whole Tribe.

Howsoever he should have renewed his old familiarity with his brethren, and
more then that, It would have caused a great fear in the Army of the
Adversaries, to have heard his Drums beating to succor his Brethren: The
union of Brethren is terrible, but their divisions are always spurs to their
Adversaries, and great advantages.

But briefly to lay him forth, he was busy about his private Commodities, his
Flocks, and his Herds, workt more with him, then Gods cause. It is a great
sault to slip opportunites in doing good, especially to our selves, and
brethren, how long could he think to have enjoyd his flocks at home, if his
Enemies had got the Field from his Brethren. Our Private gains must not be
preferred before our Countries.

And such, and no other are worldly men, when I am assaulted by the power of
Satan, or tentations. What comfort will these afford my soul? Noe: they will
neither lend me Comfort; Council, or Prayer. So his fault was in respect of
the Cause, the Time, his Person, his Friends, Adversaries, and Example.

Concordia Res parvae Crescunt,
Discordia evertuntur Maximae.
MEDITATION. 42. Upon Sleep.
THe natural sleep is a cessation of all labor, motion, action. With excess
i^ brings poverty, shame, disgrace, sicknesses, diseases* He that is given to
sleep^ shall not be rich. It stupefies, besots the best senses and faculties
of the soul^ and makes them unfit for any good employment, o^ virtuous action.
It is the Rust of the whole man.

Nature cannot move t^ Grace in its own condition* The spiritual sluggard i^
the only poor man. He that lies down in the sleep of sin, shall rise in
shame.

No such diseased person as the spiritual sluggard. His poverty, and shame may
come slowly, but violently as an Armed man.

I beseech thee (O Lord) to waken me from slumbring, or sleeping in sin. So
I may work powerfully, and ^erefully while the time, and day of grace does
shine: ^he night of death will come, ^hen no man can work. I ^ould wish that
all would ^ake St. Paul's counsel, Awake thou that sleep, arise, and stand
up, and Christ shall ^e thee light.

^omnus animae periculosus. MEDITATION. 43. Upon the sight of a fair Garden.
I Question not the Ga^ners skill, nor his diligen^* neither doubt I the good^*
either of the Ground, (...) of the Seed sown in (...)* Yet I see more Weeds,
the Herbs, or Roots, wh^ base usurping, intrud^ Hinderers are these of b^ter

(...) disturbance of those who^some, and medicina^ Herbs and Flowers, (...)
the patient Wisdom of the Master. They must grow, for that place is not
privileged here. This Mixture is tolerable as long as the Master permits it.
The best Wheat may be fanned, but yet there will some Chafe be amongst it.

(O Lord) thy skill, and diligence, is admirable in the Managing of that of
spi^ituall Garden the Church. Thy Word which is the seed (...) good, and pure,
thy Mi^isters, which are the true ^bourers, are watchful, ^d careful over it,
Yet (...) purest Congregation is ^erlac't, and mixed with Hypocrites. It was not
tha^ Heavenly Jury of Apostle^ that was free from a Judas.

I pray God, I may truel^ and faithfully discharge m^ duty. And leave the
success^ and end to the wise will o^ my Lord, and Master.

Gods Congregation is n^ more to be forsaken f^ Hypocrites being in it, the^ a
wedge of fine Gold is, f^ having two, or three grains (...) dross in it.

MEDITATION. 44. Upon Fire.
THere are five special gifts that make this In^ment admirable. Heat, Light,
Purity, his nature of ^cending, and Consuming. If ^e come too near it, it ^l
prejudice us, if we and too far from it, it will ^t benefit us. A wise
Me^iocrity is the profitablest ^ation.

I do lively (Oh God) in ^is see, and acknowledge ^y heavenly spirit of
truth, ^s that good Spirit that ^nlightens our understandings, that by his
power, and Energy I eats our Affections* who by his only Purity, an^ Sanctity
cleanses our Soule^ and Bodies, making the^ fit Temples for Himself, an^
Peculiar Vessels for his ow^ use, who by his worth teaches us to set our
Affection^ and Souls not on Things below, Temporary, Worldl^ and such as are
subject (...) sense, and corruption, but (...) mount Higher, and to se^ those
Things which are ^boue, who does expel, a^ drive out of our Souls (...)
sinful lusts, and rebelli^ corruptions.

Learn me (O Go^* Humility, not with too (...) bold a Presumption to pry into
thy Closet of Divine, and reserved Secrets, and withal, give me that care,
and wisdom to frequent: those spiritual exercises, for (...) the first is
forbidden rash^, so the other is forbidden ^th, and negligence.

Lord let me always have ^ Coal of this Fire, in the ^use of my soul, to

Ignis hic Fovendus. MEDITATION. 45. Upon the sight of a poor man Begging.
He makes the High (...) the place of his gaine^ his Rags and Soars, the
Orators of his necessity, an^ the induction for men's ch^rity. Oftentimes
Petitionates some Nobleman, b^ relation of his long suite in Law, or of his
losses by the casualty of Fire, or Wate^ or that he is destitute (...)
Friends, and Means, an^ so finds Relief, Compass^on, Clothing. What a goo^
Policy is this for our poo^ and miserable souls, Jesus Christ in his Word, in
his Sacraments, and Church, is the road way of our gains. Our sick, and
distressed Souls, and Consciences, our wounded and broken Spirits ^e the Sores
and ulcers, which move us to beg, ^d cry out for mercy: which ^so are the
only and best ^eanes to get thy Pity, fa^our, compassion. Prayers ^e our
Petitions to turn ^ay the Rigor of thy ^aw, and the Fire of thy justice.

Show thy mercy (Oh Lord and Savior) or we are ^retched. No Friends, or
means but thy Self, Merits, Pardons, Indulgences, Purgatory, Pilgrimage,
Supererogations have no force, o^ virtue. Lend us thy Roab^ of Righteousness to
adorn^ us, Thy self to cherish us* so our Persons, and Praye^ shall be
accepted, otherwis^ thou may go by us, an^ we never the better.

Lord, make us common and earnest Beggars at the Door of Mercy, so we^ need
not be ashamed of the Gifts, nor of this Profe^sion.

MEDITATION. 46. Upon the sight of a Frontiere Garrison.
What care, provision policy, and guarding is in this place. What Walls,
Moates, Halfe-moons, Horn works, Draw^idges, Ramparts, and Palli^does do I
behold, to secure ^emselues within, from the ^olence of a threatening foe
without.

How fitly does this object learn me to Barricadoe my soul from all the
entrances, and approaches of my bloody, and spiritual Adversaries, those
Out-guards, and forlorn Sconces of my Eyes, Ears, Words, and Actions are to
be well looked too; and that privy passage of my thoughts must be warily kept,
for usually the Enemy will be Vnder-mining that Place, or else closely in the
Night of ignorance will enter that too too weak Passage. So I must look that
my will judgment, Memory, affections, and understanding b^ always ready pressed
for the Holy performance of sanctifi^ duties.

Be thou always (O Lord) the Commandeire, wal^ thou the Round, and gi^ Orders
to me, how I she watch, so I need not fear any Surprisall, nor Onslaught, if
thou who never sleep take upon Thee to be the Governor in the little
City of my soul, and except thou thou do keep it, all my ^atching will be
in vain.

MEDITATION. 47. Upon a King, and Traitors.
THe Law apprehends, Arraignes, Conuicts, and Condemns these Malefac^rs, They
not only loose ^eir own lives, and honors, ^t disgrace and overthrow ^eir
Children, the King may of mercy, power, free love, and his princely Prerogative
save, or execute, Some, All, or None. Yet the Offenders in themselves without
Plea, Excuse, or Merit.

It Is just the case of A^ by Nature, God by his Law, Justice, Severity may; or
could condemn us: we are Unable, undeseruing, without excuse. It Is therefore
(Oh Heavenly Father) thy mercy, and free love to save Any o^ All, when as thou
Justly might have destroyed All* (good God) grant me a Pardon royal for all
my Rebellions, and seal it I beseech The with the Blood o^ Jesus Christ.

MEDITATION. 48. Upon the Angels.
THese Creatures are agile, Powerful, All perfect, and good by Creation,
different by sin. Their Nature, Number, Employment, show the Mercy, Justice,
Power, and Wisdom of their Creator. Their employment shows the Just wages
of Obedience, and Pride, their number what a Large, and Royal Court Heaven is,
and what a vast prison Hell is. Their Office proves that the Righteous are
always well guarded with Servants, and Defenders: and that the wicked are
always vexed with tormenting Executioners.

Let me (Oh God) beware of sin, which made Angels, Devils. Thou did
punish it in these severely, wilt not Allow it in any. My Calling gives me^ the
same Name, let me be^ ^ound faithful in it, lest ^ loose Honor, and life. They
and Men are the chief o^ thy works for Mercy, an^ Justice. They both are the
bes^ and the worst of all thy Creatures. I may learn from these, what I had
been, wha^ I must not be, and what ^ shall be.

Corruption Optimi pessima. MEDITATION. 49. Of a Physician.
GOD has made him a fit Instrument for Health. ^xperience, Knowledge, and
^ithfulnes warrant, and ^ommend him. The dis^sed must receive his Pre^riptions
with Preparation, Approbation, Thanksgiving: ^here's little hope of any ^fe
without him. These ^ree add Efficacy to his Medicines. Some neglect the ^st,
others the second, some All. So they justly groan, and greive under a
continued sickness.

It Is no otherwise with God, and our Souls. He has sent Jesus Christ the
Author of our Spiritual Health* his Knowledge, Experience, and faithfulness are
wonderful* His Prescriptions are all warrantable, and Sovereign* Many have
Vlcerated Consciences, and souls deep in a Spiritual Consumption* because
they will not receive this only Restoratiu^ I hold it best to subscrib^ to thy
Directions for Purge^ ^otion, or diet, my Recovery is not to be doubted* if I
follow thy Advise, H^ only Remedies all shakin^ Agues of wavering Consciences.
Burning Fevers o^ sinful Lust. All Consumptions of Faith, and zeal, and All
the swellings and rising of the Lights to Pride, or vain Ambition (Oh good
Samaritan) dwell in the little House of my soul, so I shall be purged, Cured,
and Comforted at all times, ^ All diseases.

MEDITATION. 50. Upon a Soldier.
See in these Professors a dangerous Mixture, some (...) march in the same Army
^ose Hearts are with their ^ethrens Enemies, And as Opportunity serves, Run ^
way, mutineere, or tu^ absolute Cowards upon Pu^ of Pike, or any great seruic^*
Yet some there are, w^ deserve Commendations (...) their qualification of
O^dience, Courage, Patience, ^fulnes, and Constancy.

It has been always (...) (Oh Lord) in the Spirit all Army, some Israeli^
have their Hearts with (...) Lords of the Philistines, f^ daily Run away f^
Gods Garrison, the Ch^* They go out from us, ^ cause they were not of u^
others turn Rebels to (...) Christ his Kingdom, wi^ Nolumus Hunc Regnare,
(...) thousands are faint-harted, and white liverd, though the cause be good,
and God has promised to defend it.

They are thy Faithful, and Elect (O God) that undergo the Heat of the day. I
beseech Thee qualify me with parts Requisite, and then I fear not the faces,
nor forces of those Goliah-like, Enemies. I am sure I shall have some true
Comrades to go with me, and some to follow me. The Lord General is marched
before with a strong Regiment, He has, and will for ever Triumph. I doubt not
to have a share of Comfort with him, as well as of Blows for him.

MEDITATION. 40. Upon seeing a Man looking upon the Sun with his Eyes
Immediately.
THis man's Judgment is Erroneous, because his Perspectiue deceives him, he
Concludes the Sun to be noe greater then it does Appear to his Eye. He may
as well conclude that it does not move, because he perceives It not. The Height
of it from the Earth, the weakness of his Sense, and the Greatness of It Is Light
makes this confusion in his Judgment.

It Is no otherwise in the spiritual Vision, the Natural Man perceives not the
Greatness, and Glory of that Sun of Righteousness, The state of Glory is not to
be seen with the Eye of Sense, or Reason. Spiritual Objects must be
Spiritually discerned.

He that will Rightly, and Effectually behold Thee (Oh Savior) must have the
Prospective of Faith. The Mystery of thy Conception, Incarnation, Resurrection,
and Ascension are so high above Nature, That Flesh, and Blood cannot attain
unto them. Such Knowledge is too deep for the mere Naturalist, (...)
beholding these deep Points, Let me put out the Eye of Reason, and open the
Eye of faith. Oh Lord give me such an Instrument, so I shall neither fail in
my Expectation, nor be falsified about the Object. For Faith draws firm
Conclusions.

MEDITATION. 52. Upon seeing a Tent Pitched up, and suddenly Removed.
HOw fit this Instrum^ is for motion, when (...) great Howses are Burthen^ and
are of that nature the they cannot be our C^panions in any sudden
extremities. This I see is of that ease, and yet convenient enough for a
Covering, That a man may carry it all day at his back, like a Snayle.

In cases of sudden necessity the Tent is the better house. I had rather have
a Tent, and escape the danger of a Pursuing Enemy, then a fair great House,
and my life taken away in it.

(Believe it) Riches, and this worldly Pomp have the greater Inconveniences.
He that has least of this worldly Goods, has the fewer fears. Feriunt Sum^os
fulmina Montes, Give ^e a poor Life with safety, rather then Riches with such
hazards. Let me never look for a long stay of certainty here, but always so
live, as expecting every moment (...) removeall from hence.

Militia est vita hominis sup^ terram.
MEDITATION. 53. Upon the covetous Rich Man* Luke 12.16,17,18,19,20.
HOw full of care was this Earth-worme? yet how secure? how foolish?

What a base sin is tha^ which makes men so greedy, and so restles in getting
wealth, and being gotten, d^ the Master of the R^ or of any good Use (...)
while he will not part with his Moneys, he must part with his Soul. And when
he thinks to gain the World, he must loose it. While he is making his
Resolutions, he is forced to his Dissolution: before he can Build, or Enlarge
his Barnes, he must pass to his Grave.

He basely seeks to hoard up that, which he should have distributed, what
fair Opportunities does a rich Covetous man loose.

Many may, and sha^ smart for having so mu^ lent to them, and they no^ lending
any, to any.

The possession gives no^ the master happiness, so much as the distribution.

The only way to gain Eternals, is to pass away Temporals.

The certainty of death* and the uncertainty of the time, is, and ought to be
a great Motive to weane us all from covetousness.

MEDITATION. 54. Upon the sight of a Pismire.
I See greater Creatures that may learn of this, to get their own living,
some reasonable Ones scarce get it so diligently, and honestly, as this
contemptible Worm. It labors while a fair opportunity is offered, Her work
is not to prejudice others by Oppression, or Extortion, merely for
sustentation against harder times, and for the well being of her self, and her
necessary Family.

A necessary direction for all Sluggards, and Spendthrifts, who may go to her,
and hear Lectures of Diligence, and Providence wisely discoursd of. The first,
she teaches to get his own Bread, and not to live by unlawful means. The
second, she tutors to provide for his Wife, and Children, and to have something
reserved for a rainy Day of Sickness, or Adversity, or both.

As I see providence in this Creature, so I observe a society with Order. There
are no Private or Domestique quarrels practiced amongst them. Nature has
settled peace, and concord in their Confines. Private Contentions are a
continual dropping to a Family, which may prove an unhappy overflowing tempest
to the Republique. Abraham's advice is worth Imitation. Let there be no
contention between thee, and me, or thy Shepherds, and mine, For we are
Brethren: Unity crowns Fraternity. Divisions are the bane of the strongest
Societies: civil wars made potent Rome a Cripple, an house divided against it
self is, as when the Head wounds the Heart, or the H^, both. It was deplored,
when Ephraim was against Manasseh, and M^nasseh against him, yet bo^ against
Judah. Peace no^ only makes a State flouris^* but also establishes, and
co^firmes it.

The goodness of the Cre^ture lies not in the grea^nes* Wisdom goes not
a^waies by strength. Many ^ther Creatures read Moral^ to man, this little great
St^dent reads Morality, and D^vinity. I would be loath the little Harvest-man
shou^ condemn me. Let me g^ther food for my soul whi^ I have the Sun of the
Gospe^* So in the days of scarce^ I shall have enough.

MEDITATION. 55. Of HEAVEN.
It Is Beautiful, Large, High, and Firm, God made it a Court for Himself,
Angels, and good men. There have been many in it, who shall never come into it
again. They cast out themselves Electione firma, It is full of beauty,
Majesty, yet the poorest Peasant may be a privileged Courtier.

It Is large, to give spacious liberty to the Inhabitants. It Is High, yet made
for the Lowly, and Humble, firm to consummate the bliss of the godly.

The beauty of thy Court makes me think what an infinite Majesty the Maker of
it is of. Secondly, it puts me in mind of the necessity of my sanctification,
for no unclean thing shall come in there. Thirdly, the glorious happiness of
thy Elect vessels, that shall dwell in it for ever.

The largnes of it shows that this Earth, and my Body, are the Prisons of my
soul, so that I desire to enjoy that spacious liberty.

The Height, and distance of it from the Earth, warnes me to begin my journey
thither betimes. The firmnes of it keeps me from despair. I may the surer
find ^t, because the Court never ^emoves. Thy Court (O God) ^s full of
Favorites. Let me, ^ entreat thee be enrolled among the rest, for One. The ^ay
is narrow, yet to be ^und. If I seek it, as I may, ^s I ought, or as
thousands ^ave done before me. (Oh Lord) whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and
who do (...) desire on Earth, in compa^son of Thee?

Glorious things are spoken ^f Thee, thou City of God.

MEDITATION. 56. Upon the Fish in the Sea.
HOw long have these creatures spaciated themselves in this watery World* yet
come forth not infecte^ with the saltnes of the place their Bodies are capabl^
of it, they lodge, and liv^ in it, feed in it, and sp^ in it.

Behold an Admirab^ Patrerne for us from the^ Seafaring Inhabitants. ^ godly
man will keep his ^tegrity at all times, and (...) all places. Though it be ^
great Blessing to have our Lotte, and Habitation in Zion, yet if it be in
Sodom, goodness is not there to be left.

I shall never approve of his Actions, who changes his mind with the places
he passes through: to be for the Coule in Rome, and Rhemes, in Geneva a
Praecisian. A Lutheran in Dantzick, A Protestant in London, and an Heathen in
Barbary.

He is not a good man who follows this Mutability, These Creatures shall
Condemn those then that will Conform themselves to all s^nes, of all places.
Drunkenness with the Dutch, Lust with French, Infidelity with the Italian,
Ambition, and cruelty with the Spaniard, Treachery with the Moore, Witchcraft
with the Laplander, Covetousnes with the Jew, Malice with the Turk, and
Hypocrisy at home.

A Wise Man keeps himself free from the sins of the Times, persons, and
places. It is not the place that makes Good, or Bad. A Man may be Good in the
Camp, and bad in the Church. I beseich thee (Oh Lord) to give me
Circumspection over my Ways, so in all places I may retain goodness, and keep
Piety.

MEDITATION. 57. Upon Saul sparing Agag, and the rich, and best of the Booty 1 Samuel 15.
HEaven would punish Amaleck with the sword, But Earth will piry him with
Govetousnes: God intends Justice, Saul aims at Profit. He looks not so much
upon his Commission to obey it, as he seeks Euasions to transgress it.

The greatest Princes may fail in their designs, when such Generals are put
upon the Execution.

Actions of the greatest Consequence laid upon the performance of unjust
stewards come short of the first Intendments.

Covetousness is as Bad a fault in a Commander as Cowardice. The one dare not
fulfill his Iniunction, the other will not.

The Pity is Execrable that hinders Heavens Justice. The Sword is sometimes to
be used rather then the Scepter. There may be time when the General in the
Field must be as a Judge, not regarding the beauty, wealth, or quality of the
person, but must proceed with Justice. If God commands the Rule to be General,
it is no safe practice to put in Exceptions. Gods Edicts need not humane helps
to perfect them. The fitest Gloss upon them is Obedience to them. This
conclusion is firm. Heaven commands this, or that, therefore it is good, being
good, It is to be performed.

Saul's proceeding in this kind is much like to a Partial Minister. God
Commands him to destroy all those spiritual Amalekites, sins. But he only
beats down the sins of poor Men, but spares, and connives at great Men's
faults, holding them Prisoners in his heart, not willing to Incur perhaps
their Disfavour.

And all those Men which only root out small Corruptions, and lesser sins
from Their souls, but let great Ones reign still, either for Profit, or
Pleasure, or both, do falsify with God, as Saul did here.

Lord I pray thee give me grace to perform what thou Command. For Obedience
is at all times, in all things pleasing to Thee.

Obedientia praestantior Hecatombis.
MEDITATION. 45. Upon his own Thoughts by way of conclusion.
It Is harder I think than to be well Employed, not to be employed at all. It
is as Toylsome to be ill Oc^upied, as it is to be Idle. ^ cannot conceive that
such ^n Operative Organ as the ^oule can want work. It may ^s well be thought
to cease ^o Be, as not to be labou^ing. She is mistress in such ^ foul
House, she had need ^wayes be cleansing, she lodges ^o many guests, that it is
a ^ontinuall work to place all in Convenient Rooms. Many Thoughts are such
Quick Guests they will be gone, and steal away some good from her, unles
she be wary.

They are all like Curreirs carrying out, and bringing in news from her, to
the World, and from the World* to her.

They are always in Travail, the soul abounds with them, as the Sun with
Moates. We are borne to Labor, and we must perform our Task. As the
Thoughts of Man ar^ Many, so they are different, All are not good, no^ all bad.

There is not any thing is ^lest with such a Library, as ^he soul of Man is,
Every Object within, and without ^eades to her observations of Morality, and
Piety. She cannot complain for want of Variety, for the whole Universe is her
study.

Her thoughts are but ^er Servants, which she ^ntertaines, or discharges as
^hey please, or dislike her.

I could wish that my ^houghts would be tied upon the Quatuor Novissima. ^o
they would never be ill ^mployed.

I pray thee (O God) ^o set a watch over all my ^houghts, That they may be such
only as may Glorify Thee, Benefit my self, and Better others, and this is my
Thought.

Come Lord Jesus, come Quickly.

MEDITATION. 59. Upon his reading the Occasional Meditations of the Reverend
Doctor Hals Composition.
It Is good to have a pa^terne, then it is a great ble^sing to stir up others
to goo^ Endeavors. I must confes^ I had not labored but by His advice: his
Fire made my Coal burn. It is as necessary a way for a Christi^n, as I know
any, and as Be^eficiall, and pleasant to the ^oule.

It Is Lawful to Imitate any ^od Action in any One, we ^ight else casheire
Exam^es, and only entertain ^recepts, but that Magis ^cimur Exemplis quam
Prae^tis, the virtues of our ^edecessors had died before ^is time, had they not
^ne maintained by wor^ Imitators. It is Blockish ^piditie then to be senseles
(...) embracing such offered ^efits.

It is the easier for the soul to collect something out of every thing. We are
all beholding to the Pens that has writ before us. I cannot see how a wise
Christian can let any thing pass him without some benefit by it For a good
Scholar in Christ's Church will reduce most things to Application. *
