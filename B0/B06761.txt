A Warning for Married Women.
Being an Example of Mrs. Jane Reynolds (a west-country-Woman) born near
Pilmouth who having plighted her troth to a Seaman, was afterward married to a
Carpenter, and at last carried away by a Spirit, the manner how shall presently
be recited,

To a west-country Tune called, The fair Maid of Bristol: Bateman, or, John
True.
THere dwelt a fair Maid in the West,
of wor^hy Birth and Fame,
Near unto Pilmouth stately Town
Jane Reynolds was her name.
This Damsel dearly was beloved,
by many a proper youth:
And what of her is to be said,
is known for very truth:
Among the rest a Seaman brave,
unto her a wooing came.
A comely proper youth he was,
James Harais called by N^me.
The Maid and Young Man was agreed
as time did them allow,
And to each other secretly,
they made a solemn vow.
That they would ever faithful be,
Whilst Heaven ^fforded life,
He was to be her Husband kind,
and she his faithful Wife.
A day appointed was also,
when they were to be married,
But before th^s^ things were brought to pass
matters were strangely carried.
All you that faithful lovers be,
give ear and hearken well,
And what of them became at last,
I will directly tell.
The Young man he was pressed to Sea,
and forced was to go,
His sweetheart she must stay behind
Whatver she would or no.
And after he was from her gone.
she three years for him staid,
Expecting of his coming home,
and kept her self a Maid.
At last news came that he was dead,
within a Foreign Land.
And how that be was buried.
she well did understand.
For whose sweet sake the maiden she,
lam^nted many a day;
And never was she known at all,
the wanton for to play.
A Carpenter that lived hard by,
when he heard of the same,
Like as the other had done before,
to her a wooing came.
But when that he had gained her love,
they married were with speed,
And four years space (being man and wife)
they lovingly agreed.
Three pretty Children in this time,
this lovely couple had,
Which made their Fathers heart rejoice
and Mother wondrous glad.
But as occ^sion served one time,
the good man took his way,
Some three days journey from his home
intending not to stay.
But whilst that he was gone away,
a spirit in the night.
Came to the window of his Wife,
and did her sorely f^ight.
Which Spirit spoke like to a man,
and unto her did say,
My dear and only love (quoth he)
prepare and come away.
James Harais is my name (quoth he)
whom thou did low so dear,
And I have traveled for thy sake,
at least this seven year.
And now I am returned again,
to take thee to m^ wife,
And thou with me shall go to Sea,
to end all further strife.
O tempt me not sweet James (quoth she)
with thee away to go.
If I should le^ve my children small,
alas what would they do
My Husband is a Carpenter,
a Carpenter of great fame,
A would not for five hundred pounds,
that he should know the same.
I might have had a Kings Daughter,
and she would have married me,
But I fors^ok her Golden Crown.
even for the love of thee.
Therefore if thou'l thy husband forsake,
and thy children three also
I will so give thee what is past,
if thou will with me go.
If I forsake my husband, and
my little Children three,
What means have thou to bring me to,
If I should go with thee.
I have seven Ships upon the Sea,
when they are come to Land.
Both Mariners and Merchandise,
shall be at the command.
The Ship where in my love shall sail,
is glorious to behold,
The sails shall be of finest,
and the mast of shining go^d
When he had told her these fair tal^s
to love him she began,
Because he was in humane shape,
much like unto a man.
And so together away they went,
from off the English shore,
And since that time the Womankind,
was never seen no more.
But when her Husband he came home.
and found his Wife was gone,
And left her three sweet pretty babas,
within the house alone.
He beat his breast, he tore his hair,
the tears fell from his eyes,
And in the open streets he run,
with heavy doleful cries.
And in this sad distracted case,
he Hanged himself for Woe,
Upon a tree, near to the place:
the truth of all is so.
The children now are fatherless,
and left without a guide.
But yet no doubt the heavenly powers,
will for them well provide.
FINIS.
