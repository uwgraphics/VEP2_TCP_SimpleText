Gallant News of late I bring,
Tidings of choosing now a King,
Whereby true Subjects may rejoice
In choosing them so sweet a choice
That love and peace may so agree,
To end the days of misery,
To the Tune of, Royal News, Royal News.


THe Prince he will come soon,

If they can agree
In love and unity,
Then we all shall see
An end of misery,

With a Free Parliament
All dangers to prevent,

To ioyn with heart and hand
For the good of England
The Gospel to defend,

Since they have made a choice,
With heart and eke with voice,

THe poor that lives in want

Till the rising of the Sun,

By him we soon shall see
An end of misery,
If once we do agree
In love and unity,
