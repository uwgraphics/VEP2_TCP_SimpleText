AN ANSWER TO The Unconstant Shepherd: OR, Fair Cynthia's Grief and Care
Crowned with Joy and Happiness, by her Lover's Return.
To an excellent New Tune.
^

I.
MY Dear let nothing trouble thy Heart,
for here I am returned again,
In order to cure that killing Smart,
of which thou so often did complain.
II.
It Is true I was banished from my Love,
which was a Torment and Grief to me;
Yet now I will ever Loyal prove,
so long as I have my Liberty.
III.
As I am thy true entire Friend,
thy faithful and ever loving Swain;
There Is no evil Tongue shall thee offend,
so long as I do alive remain.
IV.
In Kisses and sweet Embraces still,
our Minutes we'll freely pass away,
As void of the thoughts of any ill,
as inn ocent Lambs that sport and play.
V.
Thy Wishes at length are come to pass,
my Chamber and all I have is thine;
I never did see a sweeter Lass,
thy Beauty has won the Heart of mine.
VI.
By wandering shady Groves about,
expressing true Sorrow, Grief, and Care,
Thy wandering Heart has found me out,
now I am thy Captive, charming Fair.
VII.
It Is true thou said thou sett'st Love as light
as the Wind that blew from Tree to Tree,
But thy former Wrongs I now will right,
and we'll live in Love and Loyalty.
VIII.
Love dry up thy flowing Tears, he cried,
and bid all thy Sorrows and Cares adieu;
Though Fortune a while did us divide,
yet I Will Love none in the World but you.
IX.
The whifling Winds did soon convey
thy scornful Sighs, and Groans to me,
And therefore I made no more delay,
but readily came, my Love, to thee.
X.
And now in the Circuit of mine Arms,
the former Delights thou still shall find;
For viewing thy Youthful pleasing Charms,
young Phaon he cannot prove unkind.
XI.
I pitied thy bitter Sighs and Cries,
and sorrowful Groans that filled my Ears;
My Senses was struck with a strange surprise,
and straightways my Eyes did flow Tears.
XII.
Such killing Torments I then did feel,
which neither my Tongue nor Pen can tell;
No longer I could my Love conceal,
to hear thee taking thy last Farewell.
And now my sweet Cynthia and charming Fair,
if thou will but pardon what is past,
Thy Phaon does solemnly declare,
he will love thee as long as Life shall last.
Printed for. Charles Bates next to the Crown Tavern in Westsmithfield.
