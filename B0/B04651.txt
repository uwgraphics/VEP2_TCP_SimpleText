The OATH Of Allegiance.
I A. B. do sincerely Promise and Swear, That I will be Faithful, and bear
true Allegiance to their Majesty's, King WILLIAM and Queen MARY.

So help me God, etc.

The OATH Of Supremacy.
I A. B. do Swear, That I do from my Heart Abhor, Detest, and Abjure, as
Impious and Heretical, that Damnable Doctrine and Position, That Princes
Excommunicated or Deprived by the Pope, or any Authority of the Sea of Rome,
may be Deposed or Murdered by their Subjects, or any other whatsoever.

And I do Declare, That no Foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or
Potentate, has, or ought to have any Jurisdiction, Power, Superiority,
Preeminence, or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm.

So help me God, etc.
