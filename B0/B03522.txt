The Gallant SEAMAN's Resolution; Whose full Intent was, To try his Fortune at
SEA, and at his Return marry his Lanlady
If Heaven be pleased to bless him with his life,
None but his Lanlady shall be his Wife:
She being a Widow, as it is understood,
Of Carriage and Behavior very good.
To the Tune, Think on thy Loving Lanlady, etc.


A Gallant Youth at Gravesend lived,
a Seaman neither rich nor poor;
But when his means was almost spent,
he bravely went to Sea for more:
Turn to thy Love and take a kiss,
this Gold about thy wrist i will tie;
And always when thou look on this,
think on thy loving Lanlady.
His Father being dead and gone,
he loved his Mother as his life,
And did maintain her gallantly;
it was well known he had no Wife:
Turn to thy Love, etc.
He was beloved of Rich and Poor,
and still kept company with the best,
A gallant Widow in the Town,
her love unto him thus expressed:
Turn to thy love, etc.
Young Man could I thy favor win,
or might thy company but crave,
To come and live at home with me,
i will make thee Lord of all I have:
Turn to thy Love, etc.
Fair Mistress, I am for the Seas,
here is Gold and Silver in my hand,
And when the Drums and Trumpets sound
I Will bid adieu to fair England:
And if thou will with patience stay,
till I from Sea return again;
For every kiss thou lendest me,
I will repay thee ten times ten.
Do but resolve to stay at home,
I Will put another in thy place,
No, that will be a shame, quoth he,
and to my name a foul disgrace:
Turn to thy Love, etc.
I Have five hundred pound at least,
of Silver which I never told,
Besides I have in store for thee,
five hundred pound in good red Gold:
Turn to thy love, etc.
If you could give me all the wealth,
that ever Europe did afford:
A faithful promise I have made,
and I will not be worse than my word.
And if thou will, etc.
If neither strength nor policy,
can further me in my design,
Remain a constant friend to me,
and I for ever will be thine:
Turn to thy love, etc.
And whilst that breath and life does last,
to me this thing i will verify;
Though you at Sea, and I on shore,
I Will pray for thy prosperity:
Turn to thy love, etc.
Heaven bless the Ship thou sailest in,
whether it swim with wind or tide,
And all that with thee comes or goes,
I hope that Neptune will them guide:
Turn to thy love, etc.
From Pirates knocks, and bloody blows,
great Mars protect thee still,
Nor may Quicksands or stony Rocks,
have power to do thee any ill.
Turn to thy love, etc.
And whilst that thou art far away,
in Holland, Flanders, France or Spain,
As thou in safety did launch forth,
heaven bring thee safely home again.
Turn to thy love, etc.
If I may speak without offense,
my heart will never quiet be,
Till thou give me full recompense,
and say that I thy Wife shall be;
Turn to thy love, etc.
Yet one thing here I beg of thee,
before from me thou do depart,
That thou will let now unknow
the thoughts and secrets of thy heart
Turn to thy love, etc.
When thou art gone out of my sight.
and come where pretty Lasses are,
Thou will fall in love i^th some of them,
that is the thing I most do fear.
Turn to thy love, etc.
If I should hear in any case,
that to some other thou should married be,
Then would I weep, lament and grieve,
and break my heart for love of thee.
Turn to thy love, etc.
The Seamans Reply. HArk, hark, I hear the Trumpet sound,
and calls me to come away,
Therefore in have I must be gone,
I can nor will no longer stay.
And if thou will, etc.
Therefore sweet Lady now farewell,
more than a thousand times adieu,
Wherever I pass by Land or Sea,
I Will still be faithful unto you.
And if, etc.
This Golden Ribbon which you tied
about my hand wrist in pure love,
Shall be a token whilst I live,
that I to you will constant prove.
And if, etc.
And when that I return again,
if heavens afford me breath and life,
You that are now my Lanlady,
shall then be made my wedded Wife.
And if, etc.
The Bells shall ring melodiously,
the Music shall most sweetly play,
And all our Friends will then rejoice,
to see our happy Wedding day:
And if thou will with patience stay,
till I from Sea return again;
For every kiss thou lendest me,
I will repay thee ten times ten.
