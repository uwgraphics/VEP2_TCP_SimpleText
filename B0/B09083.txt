EDINBURGH, Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most excellent
Majesty. Anno 1642.

THE HVMBLE PETITION Of the LORDS and COMMONS assembled in Parliament:
Presented to His Majesty at Beverley the 16. of July 1642.
May it please your Majesty,
ALthough we, Your Majesty's most humble and faithful Subjects, the Lords and
Commons in Parliament assembled, have been very unhappy in many former.
Petitions and Supplications to Your Majesty, wherein we have represented our
most dutiful Affections in advising and desiring those things which we held
most necessary for the preservation of Gods true Religion, Your Majesty's
safety and Honor, and the peace of the Kingdom; And with much sorrow do
perceive, That Your Majesty, incensed by many false calumnies and slanders,
does continue to raise Forces against us, and Your other peaceable and loyal
Subjects, and to make great preparations for War, both in the Kingdom, and
from beyond the Seas; And by Arms and Violence to overruled the judgment and
advice of Your great Council; and by force to determine the Questions there
depending, concerning the Government and Liberty of the Kingdom: Yet such is
our earnest desire of discharging our duty to Your Majesty and the Kingdom,
to preserve the peace thereof, and to prevent the miseries of Civil War
amongst Your Subjects; That notwithstanding we hold our selves bound to use all
the means and power, which by the Laws and Constitutions of this Kingdom we
are trusted with for defense and protection thereof, and of the Subjects from
force and violence; We do in this our humble and loyal Petition, prostrate our
selves at Your Majesty's feet; beseeching Your Royal Majesty, That You will be
pleased to forbear, and remove all preparations and actions of War,
particularly, the Fores from about Hull, from Newcastle, Tinmouth, Lincoln, and
Lincolnshire, and all other places; And that your Majesty will recall the
Commissions of Array, which are illegal, dismiss Troops, and extraordinary
Guards by You raised; That Your Majesty will come nearer to Your Parliament,
and hearken to their faithful advice and humble Petitions, which shall only
tend to the defense and advancement of Religion, Your Own Royal Honor and
Safety, the preservation of our Laws and Liberties: And we have been, and
shall ever be careful to prevent and punish all Tumults, and seditious
Actions, Speeches, and Writings, which may give Your Majesty just cause of
distaste or apprehension of danger; from which public aims and resolutions, no
sinister or private respect shall ever make us to decline: That Your Majesty
will leave delinquents to the due course of Justice; And that nothing done or
spoken in Parliament, or by any Person in pursuance of the command and
direction of both Houses of Parliament, be questioned any where but in
Parliament.

And we, for our parts, shall be ready to lay down all those preparations which
we have been forced to make for our defense. And for the Town of Hull, and
the Ordinance concerning the Militia; as we have in both these particulars,
only sought the preservation and peace of the Kingdom, and the defense of the
Parliament from force, and violence, so we shall most willingly leave the town
of Hull in the state it was before Sir John Hotham drew any Forces into it;
delivering Your Majesty's Magazine into the Tower of London, and supplying
whatsoever has been disposed by us for the service of the Kingdom: We shall
be ready to settle the Militia by a Bill, in such a way as shall be honorable
and safe for Your Majesty, most agreeable to the duty of Parliament, and
effectual for the good of the Kingdom; that the strength thereof be not
employed against it self; and that, which ought to be for our security, applied
to our destruction: and that the Parliament, and those who profess and desire
still to preserve the Protestant Religion, both in this Realm, and in Ireland,
may not be left naked, and indefensible, to the mischievous designs, and
cruel, attempts of those who are the professed and confederated enemies thereof,
in Your Majesty's dominions, and other neighbour-nations. To which, if Your
Majesty's courses and counsels shall from henceforth concur, we doubt not but
we shall quickly make it appear to the world, by the, most eminent effects of
love and duty, That Your Majesty's personal safety, Your Royal Honor and
Greatness are much dearer to us then our own lives and fortunes; which we do
most heartily dedicate, and shall most willingly employ for the support and
maintenance thereof.

HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER To the aforesaid PETITION.
THough His Majesty had no great reason to believe, That the directions sent
to the Earl of Warwick, to go to the river of Humber, with as many Ships as He
should think fit, for all possible Assistance to Sir John Hotham; (whilst His
Majesty expected the giving up of the Town unto Him) and to carry away such
Arms from thence, as his discretion thought fit to spare out of His Majesty's
Own Magazin; The choosing a General by both Houses of Parliament, for the
Defense of those who have obeyed their Orders and Commands (be they never so
extravagant and illegal;) Their Declaration, That in that Case, they would
Live and Die with the Earl of Essex their General; (all which were Voted the
same day with this Petition) and the Committing the Lord Major of London to
Prison for executing His Majesty's Writs and Lawful Commands, were but ill
Prologues to a Petition which might compose the miserable distractions of the
Kingdom; Yet, His Majesty's passionate desire of the Peace of the Kingdom,
together with the Preface of the Presenters, That they had brought a Petition
full of Duty and Submission to His Majesty, and which desired nothing of Him,
but His consent to Peace, which His Majesty conceived to be the Languge of
both Houses too) begot a greedy hope and expectation in Him, That this Petition
would have been such an Introduction to Peace, that it would at least have
satisfied His Message of the eleventh of this Month, by delivering up Hull
unto His Majesty. But to His unspeakable grief, His Majesty has too much
cause to believe, That the end of some persons, by this Petition, is not in
truth, to give any real satisfaction to His Majesty, but by the specious
pretenses of making offers to Him, to Mis-lead, and Seduce His People, and lay
some imputation upon Him, of denying what is fit to be granted; otherwise, it
would not have thrown those unjust Reproaches and Scandalls upon His Majesty,
for making necessary and just Defense for His Own Safety, and so peremptorily
justified such Actions against Him, as by no rule of Law or Justice can admit
the least color of defense; and after so many free and unlimited Acts of Grace
passed by His Majesty, without any Condition, have proposed such things, which
in Justice cannot be denied to Him, upon such Conditions, as, in Honor, He
cannot Grant. However, that all the world may see how willing His Majesty would
be to embrace any overture, that might beget a right understanding between Him
and His two Houses of Parliament, (with whom He is sure He shall have no
contention, when the private practices, and subtle insinuations of some few
Malignant Persons shall be discovered, which His Majesty will take care,
shall be speedily done) He has with great care weighed the particulars of
this Petition, and returns this Answer:

That the Petitioners were never unhappy in their Petitions or Supplications to
His Majesty, whilst they desired any thing which was necessary or convenient
for the preservation of Gods true Religion, His Majesty's safety and honor,
and the Peace of the Kingdom; and therefore when those general envious
foundations are laid, His Majesty could wish some particular instances had
been applied. Let Envy and Malice object one particular Proposition for the
preservation of Gods true Religion, which His Majesty has refused to consent
to what Himself has often made for the ease of tender consciences, and for the
Advancement of the Protestant Religion, is notorious by many of His Messages,
and Declarations; what regard has been to His Honor and safecy, when He has
been driven from some of His Houses, and kept from other of His Towns by Force;
and what care there has been of the peace of the Kingdom when endeavor has
been used to put all His Subjects in Arms against Him, is so evident, that His
Majesty is confident, He cannot suffer by those general imputations* It Is
enough that the world knows what He has granted, and what He has denied.

For His Majesty's raising Forces, and making preparations for War, (whatsoever
the Petitioners, by the ill Acts of the Enemies to His Majesty's Person and
Government, and by the calumnies and slanders raised against His Majesty by
them, are induced to believe) all men may know, what is done that way is but in
Order to His Own Defense. Let the Petitioners remember That (which all the
world knows) His Majesty was driven: from His Palace of White Hall for fafety
of His Life; That both House of Parliament, upon their own Authority, raised a
Guard to themselves, (having gotten the Command of all the Train-bands of
London to that purpose) without the least color or shadow of Danger; That they
usurped a Power, by their pretended Ordinance, (against all principles and
elements of Law) over the whole Militia of the Kingdom, without and against
His Majesty's Consent; That they took Possession of His Town, Fort, and
Magazine of Hull, and committed the same to Sir John Hotham, who shut the Gates
against His Majesty; and by force of Arms, denied entrance thither to His Own
Person; That they justified this Act, which they had not directed, and took Sir
John Hotham into their protection for whatsoever He had done, or should do
against His Majesty; And all this whilst His Majesty had no other attendance,
then His Own meniall Servants: Upon this, the duty and affection of this County
prompted His Subjects here to provide a small Guard for His Own Person; which
was no sooner done, but a Vote suddenly passed of His Majesty's intention to
levy War against His Parliament (which God knows His Heart abhors) and
notwithstanding all His Majesty's Professions Declarations, and Protestations
to the contrary, seconded by the clear Testimony of so great a number of Peers
upon the place, Propositions and Orders for levies of Men, Horse, and Arms were
sent throughout the Kingdom; Plate, and Money brought in, and received; Horse,
and Men raised toward an Army, mustered, and under Command; and all this
contrary to the Law, and to His Majesty's Proclamation: And a Declaration
published, That if He should use force for the recovery of Hull, of suppressing
the pretended Ordinance for the Militia, it should be held levying War against
the Parliament; and all this done before His Majesty granted any Commission,
for the leavying, or raising a Man: His Majesty's Ships were taken from Him,
and committed to the custody of the Earl of Warwick, who presumes, under that
Power, to usurp to himself the Sovereignty of the Sea; to chase, fright, and
imprison such of His Majesty's good Subjects as desire to obey His lawful
Commands, although He had notice of the legal Revocation of the Earl of
Northumberlands Commission of Admiral, whereby all Power derived from that
Commission ceased. Let all the world now judge who began this War, and upon
whose account the miseries which may follow must be cast, what His Majesty
could have done less then He has done; and whether He were not compelled to
make provision, both for the Defense of Himself and recovery of what is so
violently, and injuriously taken from Him, and whether these Injuries, and
Indignities are not just grounds for His Majesty's Fears, and Apprehensions of
further mischief and danger to Him: Whence the Fears and Jealousies of the
Petitioners have proceeded has never been discovered, the dangers they have
brought upon His good Subjects are too evident; what those are they have
prevented, no man knows: And therefore His Majesty cannot but look upon that
charge, as the boldest, and the most scandalous has been yet laid upon Him,
That this necessary provision, made for his Own Safety and Defense, is to
overrule the judgment and advice of his great Council, and by force to
determine the questions there depending, concerning the Government? and Liberty
of the, Kingdom: If no other force had been raised, to determine those
questions then by his Majesty, this unhappy misunderstanding had not been:
And his Majesty no longer desires the Blessing, and Protection of Almighty God
upon Himself, and His Posterity, then he and they shall solemnly observe the
due execution of the Laws, in the defense of Parliaments, and the just freedom
thereof.

For the Forces about Hull, His Majesty will remove them, when He has
attained the end for which they were brought thither; when Hull shall be
reduced again to His subjection, He will no longer have an Army before it; and
when He shall be assured, That the same necessity, and pretense of public
good, which took Hull from Him, may not put a Garrison into Newcastle, to keep
the same against Him, He will remove His from thence, and from Tinmouth; till
when the example of Hull will not out of His memory.

For the Commissions of Array, which are legal, and are so proved by a
Declaration now in the Press; His Majesty wonders why they should at this
time be thought grievous, and fit to be recalled; If the fears of Invasion
and Rebellion be so great, that by an illegal pretended Ordinance it is
necessary to put His Subjects into a posture of defense, to Array, Train, and
Muster them, He knows not why the same should not be done in a Regular, Known,
Lawful way; but if in the execution of that Commission any thing shall be
unlawfully imposed upon His Subjects, His Majesty will take all just and
necessary care for their redress.

For His Majesty's coming nearer to His Parliament, His Majesty has expressed
Himself so fully in His several Messages, Answers, and Declarations, and so
particularly avowed a real fear of His safety, upon such instances as cannot
be answered, that He has reason to take Himself some what neglecsted, That
sines upon so manifest reasons, it is not safe for His Majesty to come to
them, both His Houses of Parliament will not come nearer to His Majesty, or to
such a Place, where the Freedom and Dignity of Parliament might be preserved.
However His Majesty shall be very glad to hear of some such example in their
punishing the Tumults, (which He knows not how to expect, when they have
declared that they knew not of any Tumults, though the House of Peers desired,
both for the Dignity and Freedom of Parliament, that the House of Commons
would join with them in a Declaration against Tumults) which they refused
(that is, neglected to do) and other seditious Actions, Speeches, and Writings,
as may take that apprehension of danger from Him: Though, when He remembers the
particular complaints Himself has made of businesses of that nature, and that
in stead of inquiring out the Authors, neglect of examination has been, when
offer has been made to both Houses to produce the Authors, (as in that
treasonable Paper concerning the Militia) and when he sees every day Pamphlets
published against His Crown, and against Monarchy it self, as the Observations
upon His late Messages, Declarations, and Expressions, and some Declarations of
their own, which give too great encouragement in that Argument to ill-affected
persons; His Majesty cannot with confidence entertain those hopes which would
be most welcome to Him.

For the leaving Delinquents to the due course of Justice, His Majesty is most
assured He has been no shelter to any such; if the tediousness and delay in
prosecution, the vast charge in Officers Fees, the keeping men under a general
Accusation without trial a whole year and more, and so allowing them no way
for their defense and vindication, have frighted men away from so chargeable
and uncertain an attendance, the remedy is best provided where the disease
grew. If the Law be the measure of Delinquency, none such are within His
Majesty's protection: But if by Delinquents such are understood who are made so
by Vote, without any trespass upon any known or established Law; If by
Delinquents those nine Lords are understood, who are made Delinquents for
obeying His Majesty's Summons to come to Him, after their stay there was
neither safe nor honorable, by reason of the Tumults and other Violences, and
whose impeachment, He is confident, is the greatest breach of privilege that,
before this Parliament, was ever offered to the House of Peers; If by
Delinquents such are understood, who refuse to submit to the pretended
Ordinance of the Militia; to that of the Navy; or to any other which His
Majesty has not consented to; Such, who for the peace of the Kingdom, in an
humble manner, prepare Petitions to Him, or to both Houses, as His good
Subjects of London and Kent did, whilst seditious ones, as that of Essex, and
other places, are allowed and cherished; If by Delinquents such are understood,
who are called so, for publishing His Proclamations (as the Lord Major of
London) or for reading his Messages and Declarations (as diverse Ministers about
London and elsewhere) when those against him are dispersed with all Care and
Industry, to poison and corrupt the loyalty and affection of his people; If by
Delinquents such are understood, who have or shall lend his Majesty money in
the Universities, or in any other places; his Majesty declares to all the
world, that he will protect such with his utmost power and strength, and
directs, That in these Cases they submit not to any Messengers or Warrants, it
being no less his duty to protect those who are innocent, then to bring the
guilty to condign punishment; of both which the Law is to be judge: And if
both houses do think fit to make a General, and to raise an Army for defense
of those who obey their Orders and Commands, his Majesty must not sit still,
and suffer such who submit to his just power, and are solicitous for the Laws
of the Land, to perish and he undone, because they are called Delinquents. And
when they shall take upon them to dispense with the attendance of those who are
called by his Majesty's Writ, whilst the send them to Sea to rob his Majesty of
his Ships, or into the several Counties to put his Subjects in Arms against
him, his Majesty (who only has it) will not lose the power to dispense with
them to attend his Own person, or to execute such Offices as are necessary for
the preservation of himself and the Kingdom, but must protect them, though
they are called Delinquents.

For the manner of the proceeding against Delinquents, his-Majesty will proceed
against those who have no privilege of Parliament, or in such, Cases where no
privilege is to be allowed, as he shall be advised by his learned Council,
and according to the known and unquestionable rules of the Law: it being
unreasonable, that he should be compelled to proceed against those who have
violated the known and undoubted Law only before them who have directed such
violation.

Having said thus much to the particulars of the Petition, though his Majesty
has reason to complain, That since the sending this Petition, they have beaten
their Drums for Soldiers against him, armed their new General with a Power
destructive to the Law and Liberty of the Subjects, and chosen a General of
their horse; his Majesty out of his Princely Love, Tenderness, and Compassion
of his People, and desire to preserve the peace of the Kingdom, that the whole
force and strength of it may be united for the defense of it self, and the
relief of Ireland, (in whose behalf he conjures both his houses of Parliament,
as they will answer the contrary to Almighty God, his Majesty, to those that
trust them, and to that bleeding miserable Kingdom, that they suffer not any
Moneys granted and collected by Act of Parliament to be diverted, or employed
against his Majesty, whilst his Soldiers in that Kingdom, are ready to
mutiny or perish for want of pay, and the barbarous Rebels prevail by that
encouragement) is graciously pleased once more, to propose and require:

That his Town of Hull be immediately delivered up to him; which being done
(though his Majesty has been provoked by unheard of Insolences of Sir John
Hotham, since his burning and drowning the Country, in seizing his Wine and
other Provisions for his house, and scornfully using his Servant, whom he sent
to require them, saying, It came to him by Providence and he will keep it; And
so refusing to deliver it, with threats, if he or any other of his
fellow servants should again repair to Hull about it; and in taking and
detaining Prisoners diverse Gentlemen, and others, in their passage over the
Humber into Lincolnshire, about their necessary occasions, and such other
indignities, as all Gentlemen must resent in his Majesty's behalf) his
Majesty, to show his earnest desire of Peace (for which he will dispense with
his Own honor) and how far he is from desire of Revenge, will grant a free and
general Pardon all persons within that Town.

That his Majesty's Magazine taken from Hull, be forthwith put into such hands
as he shall appoint.

That his Navy be forthwith delivered into such hands as he has directed for
the government thereof, the detaining thereof after his Majesty's directions
published and received to the contrary, and employing his Ships against him in
such manner as they are now used, being notorious high treason in the
Commanders of those Ships.

That all Arms, Levies, and Provisions for a War, made by the Consent of both
houses (by whose example his Majesty has been forced to make some
preparations) be immediately laid down, and the pretended Ordinance for the
Militia, and all power of imposing Laws upon the Subject, without his
Majesty's consent, be disavowed without which, the same pretense will remain to
produce the same mischiefs; all which his Majesty may as lawfully demand, as to
live; and can with no more Justice be denied him, then his Life may be taken
from him.

These being done, and the Parliament adjourned to a safe and secure place, his
Majesty promises, in the presence of God, and binds himself, by all his
confidence and assurance in the affection of his people, that he will
instantly, and most cheerfully, lay down all the force he shall have raised,
and discharge all his future and intended Levies, that there may be a general
face of Peace over the whole Kingdom, and will repair to them; And desires
that all differences may be freely debated in a Parliamentary way, whereby the
Law may recover its due reverence, the Subject, his just Liberty, and
Parliaments themselves, their full vigor and estimation; and so the whole
Kingdom a blessed Peace, Quiet, and Prosperity.

If these Propositions shall be rejected, his Majesty doubts not of the
protection and assistance of Almighty God, and the ready concurrence of his
good Subjects, who can have no hope left them of enjoying their own long, if
their King may be oppressed and spoiled, and must be remediless. And though
his Towns, his Ships, his Arms, and his Money be gotten and taken from him, He
has a good Cause left, and the hearts of his people, which, with Gods
blessing, he doubts not, will recover all the rest.

Lastly, if the preservation of the Protestant Religion, the defense of the
Liberty and Law of the Kingdom, the Dignity and Freedom of Parliament, and
the Recoverie and the Relief of bleeding and miserable Ireland be equally
precious to the Petitioners, as they are to his Majesty (who will have no
quarrel but in defense of these) there will be a cheerful and speedy consent
to what his Majesty has now proposed and desired.

And of this, his Majesty expects a full and positive Answer, by Wednesday the
27. of his instant July: till when he will not make any attempt of force upon
Hull; hoping in the Affection, Duty, and Loyalty of the Petitioners; and in the
mean time expects, That no supply of Men be put into Hull, or any of his
Majesty's goods taken from thence.

FINIS.
