Loves Torments Eased by Death: Or, Lovers Delayed, grow Desperate.
Being a Relation how a young Gallant thinking he was despised By Cloris,
poisoned himself, the which the Nymph understanding by Letter that she found
lying by him, ran Distracted, etc.
Cevus by Loves fierce Shaft tormented lies,
Dispairing of all Cure, self poisoned Dies.
Leaving a Letter that contained the cause
Of his sad fate, which Cloris finds, does pause,
A while upon them with the sense of grief.
Distracted grows, admitting no relief.
To a pleasant New. Court-Tune: Or, Phillis thou soul of Love.




BEauty thou Throne of Graces,
Bright Queen of Charmed faces,
Thou Goddess of endless Passion,
Thou Tyrant of the Nation:
Thou Soul that does incharm us,
Thou Fury sent to harm us;
Now happy should we be?
Proud foe were not for thee.
Numerous shining Glories,
Adorn my Lovely Cloris;
Her Face as bright as Summer,
Her Pride did well become her:
Her Praise above was given,
Each Angel flew from Heaven:
And smiling clapped his Wing,
For joy to hear her sing.
My soul was still admiring,
Her falsehood still aspiring:
I strongly did besiege her,
Yet never durst disobleige her,
But she like frosty weather,
Nip'd all my Buds together:
Believing me untrue,
My poor heart did undo.
The Second part,
of the same Tune.
WIth cruelty pursuing,
Until she proved my ruin:
My youthful joys consuming,
And blasted love just blooming:
Which must have fatal ending,
Now Death on me's descending,
Der sing torments new,
My poor hearts to subdue.
Grief shall no more distress me,
Nor wounding love oppress me,
This mortal Poison tasted,
To shades below I Am hasted:
It Is done ye cruel powers,
Death now that Love devours,
With his brigth Shaft strikes through,
My heart for ever true.
Which Cloris Love undoing,
Has forced upon sad ruin;
No more the Light desiring,
But to dark shades retiring,
Among Ghosts to be telling,
In my Elysium dwelling,
Now thinking me untrue,
My poor heart did undo.
Fair Tyranness I leave thee,
Thy Charms of Like bereave me;
Under this shade where Eying,
The first I will be dying:
Farewell my hope for ever,
My Love and Life together:
But this the World shall show
What did my heart undo.
Which he no sooner saying,
But from his bosom drawing,
He by him laid the Paper,
When with a sigh his Tapour
Of Life from Earth ascended,
And so his torments ended:
Whom Cloris thought untrue,
And his heart did undo.
He no sooner dying,
But Cloris that way prying,
Beheld her cruel conquest,
^t which with fear being Non-plust:
She started, but desire
Made her full soon draw nigher:
Whereby the Root she knew,
Which did his heart undo.
And that her charming Beauty,
To which he long paid duty,
Had been his overthrowing,
Which she no sooner knowing,
But sighed, woes me, and crying,
Alas! while I was trying,
His constancy so true,
I did his heart undo.
The which no longer hearing,
But golden Tresses tearing,
Her Ivory Breast still smiting,
Distraction so inciting:
And frantic loud did clamor,
Nor could the wood-Nymphs came her,
But crying false untrue,
That coud'st thy Love undo.
She through the Groves does wander,
Traceing each Meander,
Against the Fates exclaiming,
And her own hard heart blaming:
And comfortless deceived,
But quite of sense bereaved,
She cries, Ah me! untrue,
That could my Love undo.
FINIS.
