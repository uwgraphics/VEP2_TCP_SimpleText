The Courteous CARMAN, And the Amorous Maid. OR, The Carman's Whistle.
What here is Penned in this same pleasant Story,
Does only tend unto the Carmans Glory;
Who did relieve a Maiden in distress,
And brought her joy in midst of heaviness:
He was Courageous, and of mettle good,
As by this Story may be understood.
To a New Tune, called, The Carmans Whistle; or, Lord Willoughby's March, etc.


AS I abroad was walking
by the breaking of the day,
Into a pleasant Meadow,
a young man took his way,
And looking round about him,
to mark what he could see,
At length he spied a fair maid
under a Myrtle Tree.
So comely was her countenance,
and smiling was her cheer,
As though the Goddess Venus,
her self she had been there,
And many a smirking smile she gave,
amongst the Leaves so green,
Although she was perceived,
she thought she was not seen.
At length she changed her countenance,
and sung a mournful song,
Lamenting her misfortune,
she staid a Maid so long:
There Is many that be younger,
that long time have been wed,
Which makes me think that I shall die
and keep my Maidenhead.
Sure young men are hard hearted,
and know not what they do,
Or else they want for Complements
fair Maidens for to woe:
Why should young Virgins pine away
and lose their chiefest prime,
And all for want of Sweet-hearts,
to cheer us up in time.
THe young man heard her Ditty
and could no longer stay,
But straight unto this Damosel
with speed he did away:
He nimbly stepped unto her
which made her for to start,
But when he once embraced her,
he joy'd her very heart.
Sweet heart he said unto her
why do you so complain,
If you will be ruled by me
i will play you such a strain,
As uses for to give content
when as true Lovers meets,
It is much like to that they call
the shaking of the sheets.
Strike up quoth she, and spare not
I prithee use thy skill,
For why I greatly care not
If I thy mind fulfill,
The Carman then most nimbly
unto this sport did settle,
And pleased her most bravely
for he was full of mettle.
When he had played unto her
one merry note or two,
Then she was so rejoiced
she knew not what to do:
O God a mercy Carman,
thou art a lively Lad;
Thou have as rare a Whistle
as ever Carman had:
Now if my Mother chide me
for staying here so long,
What if she does I care not
for this shall be my song:
Pray mother be contented
break not my heart in twain^
Although I have been ill a while
I shall be well again:
And thus this loving couple
did oftentimes embrace,
And lovingly did prattle
all in that flowery place;
But now the time of parting
began for to draw near,
Whereas this Noble Carman
must leave his only dear,
He took his leave most kindly
and thus to her did say,
My dearest I will meet thee
next time I come this way:
Away this bonny Carman went
a whistling of his Note,
And there he left this fair Maid
a brushing of her Coat.
Now fare thee well brave Carman
I wish thee well to fare,
For thou did use me kindly
as I can well declare:
Let other Maids say what they will
the truth of all is so,
The bonny Carmans Whistle
shall for my money go.
