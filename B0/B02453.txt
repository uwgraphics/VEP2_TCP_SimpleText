THE Coy COOK-MAID, Who was Courted importunately by Irish, Welsh, Spanish,
French and Dutch, but at last was conquered by a poor English Tailor.
To the Tune of, There was a brisk Lass. etc. This may be Printed, R. P.




John scrub'd up her rooms, made all things clean,
The tables, the chair, and the edge of the shreen,
She scoured eac^ pispot and pe^ter-dish
Make e'rything clean as heart could wish;
The ^^water and brass was so very clear,
That ^^nting a glass, she often drew near,
To (...) her beat and curle her (...),
Not one amongst twenty with her could compare.
She wrote hit plumb po^tage and sweet mine'd-ples,
The cost-beef was laid down when she did rise;
Dinner was ready, and liked so well,
Not one amongst twenty could Joan excel;
They praiss'd her so much that Joan grew proud,
And then she began to pra^e aloud,
I will have a husband often she cried,
I pretty young man a lie by my ^^^e*
Then out stepped a Scot with blew bonnet on,
He looked full as big as a Spanish son
His pistol was under his checkered pla^e,
His whinyard was made of a Bilbo blade:
Quoth he, bread a gad, the day's mine a^^n,
I^e as bonny a fellow as ever was knawn,
I^e will be this lassee, before I se gang beam,
She Will mark me geud long^^al to fill my weam,
He come salute her, but Joan was mad,
And called the poor scotch man a sawey lad,
She took up the ladle and broke his and ^^^
And told him he prosser'd his love too late:
Deel blin you, quoth Sawny, you nasty slut,
The wickl der^ stop ^emp in your ^ut,
Isen ^set^ Joan to be my wife,
She Will e'ne meek on weary of my life,


Then a sine frenchman took his place,
His cravet and ruffles where all of ^are.
Said he, begar, me comes to dis^place,
Me be much in love vid your^ sweet face,
Me no like no law v^o^n this town.
Begar, me no like them, dey ver^ much frown;
(...) have seen all, me sink dere's none
But may be compared vid mistress Joan.
(...) be resolve to lose my life
But me till have Joan to be my wife:
Joan looked about, and then replied,
The devil shall be the french man's bride;
March to your portage you ^inical kn^^e,
I Will ne't go to France to be your ^^^ve;
Get you out of the kitchen, or else by Mars
This swinging sp^t shall run through your a --
Poor monsieur looked blank and sneakt away,
For his wife nor his life he durst not stay;
Then entered on ^rish man and swore
The noise of her beauty brought him over;
No naam ish Teague, and by my (...)
I prize by faith 'bove all ^n de Naashon,
Den preddee dear joy come kish my shweet fa^^h,
By shaint Phaatrick I never will leave this plaash.
I have a potato-plat of my own,
An a shneeshing b^^h, 'tish very well known;
I have a sehullogue to run by my ^^^^e,
I fait and trote thou shall be my bride.
Be gone bogg-trotter, then Joan did cry,
Or the from stick shall on your shoulders lie,
Pack up your awle, and make short of your story,
Or I Will make you pay dear for your vainglory.
A seaman from Holland then enter's the (...)
As muc-ken a rascal as ever ^^st;
He Naught in his hand a bottle of Nans,
And swore 'twas the famous^st liquor in Fran^
'I will make you Dutch spraagen before it be
Be gone (said she) you drunken clown,
I Will pull ^he blew rug from off your pate,
If you offer to stay with Joan to prate.
And then Jack Spaniard began to vapor,
With a mighty short cloak and a very l^^^
He offered his service and proudly did ^^^ut,
But Joan went and gave him a kick with (...)
He insolent dog (quoth she) be gone,
There Is none I hare more then a Spanish (...)
I mean not to wait upon such a proud sinn^^
Whilst be is pomp'ring his guts at ^^nner.
The welch-man hearing the test were gone,
Resolved that he would be with her a^^on,
With le^k in his bar, on St. Taffy's day*s
He came to Joan, and thus he did say:
Hur was a prave shentleman in Wales,
Hur has a food land, cots-plutter-a-nails,
Hur has a fine goat, and hur makes ^heese,
Was hur makes hur a lady if now hur please*
But Joan protested she hated them ^lt.
And swore to be at an english manned call;
She knew their humors and did not d^ubs*
But same or other would choose her out;
At last she married a tailor good lord*
And he the gre^sy frig at did ^eard;
They both were well pleased and (...) agreed,
And she from the ^est of her suitors was freed.
