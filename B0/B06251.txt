The True Lovers Joy: OR, A Dialogue between a Seaman and his Love.
The Maid implores the Aid of Charon's Boat,
That to the gloomy shades her Soul migh float,
With sighs and groans, much weary and oppressed,
At last he heard her moan, and gave her rest,
From all past dangers, and from future harms,
She safe arrived and Anchored in in his arms.
To a new Tune, much in request.
HArk Charon come away,
bring forth thy Boat and Oars,
And carry me poor harmless Maid,
unto the Elysium shoars.
Who Charon calls in have,
whilst I sit here in pain?
I carry none but pure and chaste,
such as true Love has slain.
I am come, dear Soul I come,
thy face does so incharm me,
Come in my Boat and take thy room,
no wind nor wave shall harm thee.
Now I am come in thy boat,
I am a Maid undone,
Sighing my heart is almost broke,
for my Love he is from me gone.
Thus as I pass the shades,
I Will tell you a mournful tail,
So full of sighs as we do pass.
shall serve us for a Gale.
And so beguiled the time,
I Will sing you a true Lovers song,
Mine eyes shall flow a sea of tears,
to carry the Boat along.
Oh what is become of those hard heart
of a Virgins takes no pity;
They Are sailing to Virginia parts,
where Neptune has built a City.
O Cupid has wounded me,
and haht pierced my tender heart,
To call for one whom I loved so dear,
who cares but little for it.
Thus in the shades below,
we will wast the tedious hours
No gusts of winds, but sighs shall blow,
the Boat with Charon's Oars.
His Answer.
Stay Gentle Charon stay,
and let thy boat alone,
Row not the harmless Maid away,
that sirs and makes her moan.
For she that calls so fast;
and sighs so at thy stay.
A Virgin is as pure and chaste,
as e're true Love did slay.
She Is no dear soul for thee,
let not her face encharm thee,
Though room within thy Boat there be,
(...) thee
O fair one, if you go;
I Am more undone than you,
My Heart does equal sorrow know,
and still my Love is true.
The shades you must not pass,
nor mournful stories tell,
In stead of sighing Gales, alas!
a kiss will do as well.
You Would better stay a shore,
and sing us a true Lovers Song,
It is enough we need no more
to carry his Boat along.
No Heart so hard I know,
but would gladly ease your pain,
Else heart let him to Virginia go,
and never return again.
If Cupid has wounded you,
he had wounded me before,
I you Love as you say you do,
I love you as much or more.
In beds of softest Down,
we will spend the short lived nights,
No gust of Wind or sighs shall drown,
the current of our Delights.
Maid.
COme gentle Charon come
and me to shore remove,
The wind dispairing fight did blow,
shall waft me unto my Love.
How slow the Boats man stears,
if he no faster ply,
My love to rid me of my fears,
shall lend me his wings to fly.
To thee dear Love I float,
finding thee just and true,
And bid to Charon and his Boat,
eternally adieu.
Make have, make have my dear,
for if thou longer stay,
Through the floods without all fears,
my Arms shall make their way.
Welcome my Love to shore,
I Will keep thee from harms,
And thou shall ride for ever more,
at Anchor in my Arms.
FINIS.
1694.
