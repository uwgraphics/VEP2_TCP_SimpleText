A merry Jest of John Tomson, and Iakaman his Wife:
Whose Jealousy was justly, the cause all their strife.

To the Tune of Pegge of Ramsey.




WHen I was a Batchelour
I lived a merry life:
But now I am a married man,
and troubled with a wife,
I cannot do as I have done,
because I live in fear:
If I go but to Islington,
my wife is watching there.
Give me my yellow Hose again,
give me my yellow hose:
For now my wife she watches me,
see yonder where she goes.
But when I was a prentice bound,
and my Indentures made:
In many faults I have been found,
yet never thus afraid.
For if I chance now by the way,
a woman for to kiss:
The rest are ready for to say,
thy wife shall know of this.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Thus when I come in company,
I pass my mirth in fear:
For one or other merrily,
will say my wife is there.
And then my look does make them laugh,
to see my woeful case:
How I stand like John hold my staff,
and dare not show my face.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Then comes a handsome woman in,
and shakes me by the hand:
But how my wife she did begin,
now you shall understand.
Fair dame (quoth she) why do thou so,
he gave his hand to me:
And thou shall know before thou go,
he is no man for thee.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Good wife (quoth she) now do not scould,
I will do so no more:
I thought I might have been so bold,
I knowing him before,
With that my wife was almost mad,
yet many did entreat her:
And I, God knows, was very sad,
for fear she would have beat her.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Thus marriage is an enterprise,
Experience does show:
But scolding is an exercise,
that married men do know.
For all this while there was no blows,
yet still their tongues was talking:
And very feign would yellow hose,
have had her fists a walking.
Give me my yellow, etc.
In comes a neighbor of our town,
an honest man, God woe:
And he must needs go sit him down,
and call in for his pot.
And said to me, I am the man,
which gave to you your wife:
And I will do the best I can,
to mend this wicked life.
Give me my yellow hose again,
give me my yellow hose:
For now my wife she watches me,
see yonder where she goes,
The second Part,
to the same Tune.




I Gave him thanks, and had him go,
and so he did indeed:
And told my wife she was a shrow,
but that was more then need.
Says he thou have an honest man,
and one that loves thee well:
Said she you are a fool good sir,
Its more then you can tell.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
And yet in truth he loves me,
but many more beside:
And I may say good sir to thee,
that cannot I abide.
For though he loves me as his life,
yet now sir wot you what:
They say he loves his neighbors wife,
I pray you how like you that
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Says he I hope I never shall,
seek fancy fond to follow:
For love is lawful unto all,
except it be too yellow.
Which lies like the Iaundies so,
In these our women's faces:
That w^tch their husbands where they go,
and hunt them out in places.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Now comes my Neighbors wife apace,
to talk a wo^d or two:
My wife then meets her face to face,
and says dame is it you,
That makes so much of my good man,
as if he were your own?
Then clamp as closely as you can,
I know it will be known.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Now when I saw the woman gone,
I called my wife aside,
And said why art thou such a one,
that thou can not abide
A woman for to talk with me,
this is a woeful case:
That I must ke^pe no company,
except you be in place.
This makes Batchelers to woo,
so long before they wed:
Because they hear that women now,
will be their Husbands head,
And seven year long I tarried,
for lakaman my wife:
But now that I am married,
I am weary of my life.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
For yellow love is too too bad,
without all w^e or policy:
And too much love has made her mad,
and filled her full of Jealousy.
She thinks I am in love with those,
I ^peake to passing by:
That makes her wear the yellow hose,
I gave her for to dye.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
But now I see she is so hot,
and lives so much at ease:
I will go get a Soldiers coat,
and sail beyond the Seas:
To s^rue my Captain where and when,
though it be to my pain:
Thus farewell gentle Iakaman,
till we two meet again.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
Quoth she good husband do not deal,
thus hardly now with me,
And of a truth I will reveal,
my cause of jealousy:
You know I always paid the score,
you put me still in trust:
I saved twenty pound and more,
confess it needs I must.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
But now my saving of the same,
For ought that I do know:
Made Jealousy to fix her frame,
to weaue this web of woe:
And thus this foolish love of mine,
was very fondly bent:
But now my gold and goods are thine,
good husband be content.
Give me my yellow hose, etc.
And thus to lead my life a new,
I finly now purpose:
That thou may change thy coat of blew,
and I my yellow hose.
This being done our Country wives
may warning take by me,
How they do live such jealous lives,
as I have done with thee.
Give me my yellow hose again,
give me my yellow hose:
For now my wise she watches me,
see yonder where she goes.
