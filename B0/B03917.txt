John's Earnest Request: OR, Betty's compassionate Love extended to him in a
time of Distress.
Late in the Night, when all was fast,
John came in both cold and wet,
And after some few words were past,
her Lover in she let.
To a Pl^^^^nt new Tune much in request.
This may be Printed;

R. P.







COme open the Door sweet Betty,
for it is a cold winters night,
It rains, and it blows, and it thunders,
and the Moon it does give no light.
It is all for the love of sweet Betty,
that here I have lost my way;
Sweet let me lie behind thee,
until it is break of Day.
I dare not come down sweet Johnny,
nor I dare not now let you in,
or fear of my Father's anger,
and the rest of my other Kin:
For my Father he is awake,
and my Mother she ^ill us hear
Therefore be gone sweet Johnny,
my I^^ and only Dear.
If that thou do love me show it,
and do not in anger frown,
Thy Parents they need not know it,
if thou will come Softly down:
Then prithee no don't deny me,
but come at thy Lover's Call;
For what though I should lie by thee,
I Will do thee no harm at all.


Alas! (...) loath to venture,
for if that they should awake,
As soon as the Door you enter
a Racket I Am sure they will make:
You know that old Folks are froward,
and jealous of handsome Men,
And should we be overpowered,
in what a case were we then.
I Will shelter my Dear from danger,
should any Outrage begin,
Thou know that I am no stranger,
then prithee Love let me in:
Long time in the Cold, I Have tarried,
oh! pity thy true Love John,
To morrow we will be married,
as I am an honest Man,
This is a fair pleasing Story,
Which almost my Heart has won,
But if you should blast my Glory,
And leave me when all is done,
My Father would surely chide me,
my Mother would scold and brawl,
And all the young Maids deride me,
oh! this is the worst of all.
Thy Johny will never deceive thee,
but love thee as dear as my Life:
Nor will I one hour leave thee,
until thou art made my Wife:
Let me not stand any longer,
for why? dear Betty behold,
The Storm grows stronger and stronger,
and I am both wet and cold.
It was about midnight hour,
When John he did thus complain;
Poor heart! she had not the power
to let him stand in the Rain:
Without any longer dodging,
she opened the door with speed,
And let him unto her Lodging,
good Man he had never more need.
It being cold Winter Weather,
they strait did hurry to Bed,
And there they cuddl'd together,
and John got her Maidenhead,
She was of a coueteous Carriage,
by which young Johnny was wed,
Next day they were joined in Marriage,
and was not this honestly done!
