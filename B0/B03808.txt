Hey for Lubberland






THere is a ship we understand,
now riding in the river,
It Is newly come from Lubberland,
the like I think was never;
You that a lazy life do love,
I Would have you now go over,
They say the land is not above
two thousand leagues from Dover.
The captain and the master too,
does give us this relation,
And so does all the whole ship's crew,
concerning this strange nation
The streets are paved with pudding-pies,
nay, powder'd-beef and bacon,
They say they scorn to tell you lies:
Who thinks it is mistaken?
The king of knaves, and queen of sluts
reign there in peace and quiet;
You need not fear to starve your guts,
there is such store of diet:
There may you live free from all care,
like hogs set up a fatning,
The garments which the people wear,
is silver, silk, and satin.




The lofty buildings of this place,
for many years have lasted,
With nutmegs, pepper, cloves, and mace,
the walls are there rough casted,
In curious hasty-pudding boiled,
and most injensous carving;
Likewise they are with pancakes tied,
sure, here is no fear of starving.
The captain says, In every town,
hot roasted pigs will meet ye,
They in the streets run up and down,
still crying out, Come eat me:
Likewise he says, at every feast,
the very fowls and fishes,
Nay, from the biggest to the Jest,
comes tumbling to the dishes,
The rivers run with claret fine,
the brooks with rich canary,
The ponds with other sorts of wine,
to make your hearts still merry:
Nay, more than this, you may behold,
the fountains flows with brandy,
The rocks are like refined gold,
the hills are sugar candy.
Rose Water is the rain they have,
which comes in pleasant showers
All places are adorned brave,
with sweet and fragrant flowers.
Hot custards grows on every tree,
each ditch affords rich jellies;
Now if you will be ruled by me,
go there and fill your bellies.
There Is nothing there but holy days;
with music out of measure;
Who can forbear to speak the praise,
of such a land of pleasure?
There may you lead a lazy life,
free from all kind of labor:
And he that is without a wife,
may borrow of his neighbor.
There is no law not lawyers fees.
all men are free from fury,
For every one does what he please,
without a judge or jury:
The summertime is warm they say,
the winter's never the colder,
They have no landlords rent to pay,
each man is a freeholder.
You that are free to cross the seas,
make no more disputation,
In Lubberland you will live at ease,
with pleasant recreation:
The captain waits but for a gale
of prosperous wind and weather,
And th^^ they soon will hoist up sail,
make have away together.
