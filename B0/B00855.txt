A Warning for all Murderers.
A most rare, strange, and wonderful accident, which by Gods just judgment
was brought to pass, not far from Rithin in Wales, and shown upon three
most wicked persons, who had secretly and cunningly murdered a young Gentleman
named David Williams, that by no means it could be known, and how in the end
it was revenged by a child of five years old, which was in his Mothers womb,
and unborne when the deed was done.

To the tune of, Wigmores Galliard.




GIve ear unto my story true,
you graceless men on earth:
Which any way in secret seek
your neighbors timelesse death.
Not many pleasant Summers past
this wicked work was done,
Which three accursed kinsmen wrought
against their Uncles son.
A kind and courteous Gentleman,
his aged Fathers joy,
The only heir into his Lands
that should his place enjoy.
His envious Nephews gaping still,
his day of death to see,
Thought every year that he did live,
seven yeer^s and more to be.
Because this gentle Gentleman,
once being laid in grave,
Their aged Uncle being dead,
they should the living have:
The thought whereof did often make
their hearts with joy abound,
For that they knew the living worth
each year an hundred pound.
But when they saw this toward Youth
live up to man's estate,
And to himself has likewise chose
a faithful loving mate,
Then were they out of hope and heart,
but most, when they did see
His beauteous wife in little space,
most big with child to be.
Then did the Devil entice them straight
to murder, death, and blood,
Thereby to purchase to themselves
their long desired good.
A hundred ways they did devise
this Gentleman to kill:
But yet his wife being big with child,
stuck in their stomach still.
If we should slay the one, they said,
and let the other live,
No comfort to our hearts desire
that deed at all would give:
The brat new bred within her womb,
none can for heir deny:
Therefore it is meet and requisite,
that both of them should die.
And for to blind the eyes of men,
strange garments had they got,
Which to perform that wicked deed
they only did allot.
And after this most bad pretense,
the Gentleman each day,
Still felt his heart to throb and faint,
and sad he was always.
His sleep was full of dreadful dreams,
in bed where he did lie,
His heart was heavy in the day,
yet knew no reason why,
And often as he did sit at meat,
his nose most suddenly,
Would spring and gush out crimson blood,
and straight it would be dry.
It chanced so upon a time,
as he his supper ate,
His eyes and heart so heavy were,
that he slept at his meat,
Now fie, then quoth his loving wife,
and woke him presently,
Why is my Dear so drowsy now?
quoth he, I know not, I.
Good wife, he said, let us go walk
about our Land a while,
I shall be wakened thoroughly,
when I have walked a mile.
His wife agreed, and forth they went,
most kindly arm in arm:
But suddenly were they espied,
that thought on little harm.
At length three sturdy men they met,
in Soldiers tattered rags,
With swords fast girt unto their sides,
which tangled in their jagges:
Their faces smeared with dirt and soote,
in loathsome beastly wise,
With black thrumb'd hats upon their heads
as is the Germans guise.
And when they saw no persons nie,
those helpelesse couple then,
They wounded sore in cruel sort,
like most accursed men,
And in the thickest of the corn,
which in that place was hie,
They dragged the murdered bodies then,
and so away did hie.
And soon they shifted off their rags,
and hid them by the way,
And weaponlesse they homeward went,
clad in their own array.
Long did the silly servants wait
their Masters coming home,
Which dead within the field did lie,
all bathed in bloody foam.

A Warning for all Murderers.
The second part of the Murder of David Williams, and his Wife being great with
child, which was revenged by a child of five years old, which was in his
Mothers womb, and unborne when the deed was done.
To the tune of, Wigmores Galliard.
AT length, when dark and gloomy clouds
had shadowed all the sky,
The servants wandered up and down,
their Master to epsy:
And as they past along the place
where these were lately slain,
Within the corn they heard one groan,
as heart would break in twain.
And running straight to search and see,
who gave this ghastly sound:
Their Master dead their Mistress stabbed,
yet living there they found,
In bitter pangs in travel then
this woeful woman lay,
And was delivered of a Son,
before the break of day.
Then died she incontinent,
no memory had she
For to descry the murderers,
nor found they could not be.
They both together buried were,
the child to Nurse was set,
Which thrived and prosper'd passing well,
no sickness did him let.
But now behold Gods judgment just:
the truth I shall you tell,
Ere this child was seven quarters old,
this strange event befell:
One of the murderers being set
at Tables on a day,
The Nurse did chance to bring this child
within that place to play.
The child under the Table got,
unthought of any one,
And bit his Cousin by the leg,
hard at the ankle bone,
Which by no help nor Art of man
could ever healed be,
But sweld and rotted in such sort,
that thereof dyed he.
Not full a twelvemonth after this,
this child did chance to be,
Whereas the second murderer
was drinking merrily:
He took one of the biggest pinnes
that stuck about his breast,
And thrust it in his Kinsmans thigh,
where then the sign did rest.
Which done, he laughing ran his way,
the wound did bleed amain:
By no means could they stanch the blood,
nor ease his extreme pain.
The grief and anguish was so great,
which thereof did proceed,
That ere three days were fully past,
the man to death did bleed.
The child with rods was swing'd full sore,
for this unhappy act,
Yet never would forgiveness ask
for his committed fact.
Thus past it on, until the time
this child was five years old:
The other murderer living still
with conscience bad, behold,
He never after saw the child,
but he would shun the place,
The child did never look on him,
but with a frowning face:
And stones at him still would he fling,
where ere he did him meet:
Which made the neighbors wonder much
that oftentimes did see it.
In Harvest next this little child,
with other boys beside,
Went to the Fields, and open mouthed,
this man asleep they spide:
The child having a bramble stick,
within his hand to play,
Did thrust it down his Cousins throat,
a sleeping as he lay.
The man therewith being soon awak't,
did strive to pull it out:
And he thereby did rent and tear
his windpipe round about:
Which being found incurable,
as he lay in his bed,
His murderous deed he did confess,
as you before have read.
FINIS.
