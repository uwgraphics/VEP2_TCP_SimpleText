Unto us all that are inferiors and subjects that we may willingly and gladly,
Love, honor serve, and obey all superior powers, in the, and for the that we
may joyfully receive thy Ghospel, plenteousslye bring forth the fruits
thereof. And in all things chiefly apply our selves, to the maintenance of
thy true worship, and setting forth of thy Honor and glory. Amen

Unto the ingnorant also that their eyes may be opened, that it would please
the to show thy countenance unto them. That they may know thee. and thy
Church which they condemn as erours? because their eyes are closed up in
darkness, that as their zeal is now in simplicity without knowledge, so they
may have in stead of it, a godly zeal, grounded on perfect knowledge: so
that thy Gospel may fructefy in them also to the glory of thy holy name. Amen

For the malicyous persecutors
EVen unto the malicious persecutors also, that they may either at the
length, receive thy grace so often, and so mercifullye proffered unto them, and
so acknowledge their malice, and return unto thee, to thy great honor and
glory, when thou shalt be praised even by the mouth of thy enemies: Or else
if they have utterly given over the^ selves, unto continual hatred of thee
and thy word, and utterly rejected all kind of discipline. That then thou
take them away from among us, to thy great honor and glory also: when as
thy little flock, being delivered from their tirannye and oppression, shall
joyfully singe unto thee, of thy contynuall goodness and wonderful
deliverance. Amen.
