A SHORT DECLARATION OF THE KINGDOM OF SCOTLAND, For Information and
Satisfaction to their Brethren of ENGLAND, concerning the present Expedition
into ENGLAND.
ALthough we have reason to believe that the bloody and barbarous attempts of
the Papists and their Faction, both in England and Ireland, and the manifold
oppressions and miseries endured by those that stand well affected to the
Protestant Religion, and their Countries Liberty, have made way in the hearts
of men for the ready entertainment of assistance from their Brethren, whose
earnest desire it is, and whose utmost endeavor it shall be, to preserve and
restore both unto them: Yet knowing how industrious the malice of the Devil and
his Instruments are, in raising Prejudices, and fomenting Jealousies betwixt
them whose hearts and minds ought to be one, because their happiness is the
same, and particularly betwixt us and our Brethren of England, that by dividing
us from each other, they might destroy us both: And that this our second
Expedition into England (which we doubt not but God will bless, to the
advantage of that Nation, as he did our first, to the happiness of our own) in
stead of wonder and opposition, may find the cheerful concurrence of all
those who together with us desire, The Preservation and Reformation of
Religion; The honor and happiness of the King; The Peace and Liberty of the
Kingdoms: We thought fit to premit this short, but free and ingenuous
Declaration, of our Grounds and Intentions in this our present undertaking,
that so we may meet with none but such as we may either find peaceable or
leave inexcusable.

Whereas therefore the greatest questions that are like to arise in this
business may be reduced to these three particulars, viz. The justness of our
Cause: The lawfulness of our calling thereto: And The faithfulness of our
carriages therein; We shall hereby endeavor to give satisfaction in them all,
and doubt not to do it, unless there remain some whose inveterate malice has
produced in them a resolution to be unsatisfied.

As for the cause and ground of this undertaking, we are not ignorant with how
much earnestness the sons of slander and perdition (whose custom is to
traduce those proceedings which they know not how to disappoint) do endeavor
to possess the hearts of our Brethren, that we are coming to fish in the
troubled waters of England, to seek and take our own advantages in the midst of
your necessities. But suffer not your ears, much less your hearts, to be open
to any such delusions, whereof we trust your eyes shall shortly witness the
falsehood: For as hereafter we doubt not to appeal to our carriages and your
consciences, besides your late experience of our Religious observance of our
former Declarations of this kind; so in the mean time give us leave to appeal
to the great searcher of hearts, who knows; That had not the love of Christ,
requiring Christians to bear one another burden; and the Law of nature,
challenging our utmost care and endeavor, for the prevention of our own danger
and ruin, which an ordinary understanding will easily see to be wrapped up in
our neighbors; And our duty, and desire of rescuing the King from the dangers
wherein he is involved, by the company and pernicious Counsel of those who are
enemies to Religion, his Majesty's happiness, and Peace of his Dominions;
Called and compelled us to this Service, we could, with far more content and
satisfaction to our selves, have enjoyed with quietness our dry morsel, then
entered into your houses full of sacrifices with strife: Which yet since we are
required and necessitated to, by that just Calling, hereafter to be mentioned,
We profess before God and the World, that our hearts and thoughts are clean
and free from any other Intentions then those expressed in our solemn League
and Covenant, in which we are confederate with England, viz. The Preservation
and Reformation of Religion; The Honor and Happiness of the King; and, The
Peace and Liberties of the Kingdoms. All which we now apprehend to be deeply
endangered, by the Councels and Confederacies of Papists, Prelates, Malignants,
and their adherents, so prevalent in England and Ireland: And we shall no
otherwise desire a blessing upon our endeavors, then as they shall be directed
to the conservation and establishment thereof.

And because it is not sufficient to be engaged in a good Cause, unless by a
good calling, we do hereby further declare, That though the inseparable
interests of both Nations in (...) Religion and Liberties, which having the
same common Enemies, must look to stand and fall together, might have given us
sufficient warrant to have endeavored the prevention of our own ruin, by
preserving our Friends and Brethren from destruction: yet that we might be the
more fully and formally obliged to this Christian duty and service, and so the
mouth of slander and malice be stopped, God has so ordered things in his wise
and just Providence, that the Parliament of England, who (beside their interest
in the Preservation and Reformation of Religion, and the defense of the Laws
and Liberties of the Kingdom, to which our help is required) have a particular
obligation upon this nation, (As we have formerly declared in our Intentions
published before our last Expedition) for refusing to countenance or maintain a
War against us, in the year 1640. have thought fit by their Commissioners,
enabled to that effect, to desire a firm Union with us, and this just and
necessary assistance from us.

And whereas it is too obvious an Objection, That the Kings command or consent
being no ingredient, our Calling is thereby rendered deficient: We answer, That
though, through the injury of mischievous Councels, both his Person and
personal Commands are withheld from us: Yet his Honor, his Happiness, his
Posterity, his great Council, and the welfare of his Kingdoms, Call
importunately to us for this timely interposing. So that unless we can (which
God forbid) blot out of our thoughts the sense of Piety and Religion toward
God, of Honor and Duty toward our Sovereign, and of Gratitude toward the
Parliament and Kingdom of England, we can in no wise resist our present Call to
this undertaking.

And lastly, for what concerns the manner of the pursuance of this just Cause
and lawful Calling: Although the many frustrate Petitions and Remonstrances
from both Kingdoms presented to his Majesty, have left us only this way,
which yet is not intended against his Majesty's Person, nor any of his good
Subjects, but those Enemies of the King and Kingdoms, with whom no other means
can prevail: Yet we shall diligently endeavor so to order the affairs of our
Army, that all Insolences, Rapines, Plunderings, and those other calamities
that usually attend upon War, may be prevented. And herein as with no small
content to our selves, so with no less satisfaction to you, are we able to
refer you to the experience of our former Expedition (when our own necessities
drove us into England, as now yours do call us) to Conlider how little damage
was occasioned by our means, how little disorder was committed by us in any
place where we came: and we hereby promise the like care and diligence shall be
renewed, and if possible doubled to that effect.

And that we may not be looked on with the prejudice of Strangers, which we
hope the firm Union of this mutual Covenant will wear out, There is a
Committee of your own Nation, the most of which are Parliament men, such to
whom you have committed the trust and care of your Religion, Laws, and
Liberties, joined with us, without whose concurrence nothing that concerns you
is to be transacted. And to free you of all unjust suspicion, which if your
minds are not ready to conceive, yet the malicious mouths of our adversaries
and yours are ready to suggest, That notwithstanding this Declaration, we have
some sinister and secret ends which may prove prejudicial to your Rights and
happiness: Be it hereby made known unto you, that we have freely engaged our
selves, by an Article of the late Treaty betwixt the Nations, to give the
public Faith of the Kingdom of Scotland unto the Kingdom of England, That
neither our entrance into nor continuance in that Kingdom, shall be made use of
to any other ends then are expressed in the Covenant, and that Treaty
subscribed by the Commissioners o^ both Kingdoms, which we are resolved, to the
honor of God and of this nation, to keep inviolate.

And as our Friends and Brethren may look for actions conform to the
expressions of this Declaration, so must the Malignants and implacable opposers
of the ends declared in our Covenant, expect nothing but an impartial and
vigorous prosecution of the same: in which, if any evil befall them, we are
confident that the judgment of wise and indifferent men will reduce it to
themselves, as the wilful authors thereof.

And finally we declare (against all false and artificial relations) that we
are so far from desiring harm or loss to any of our Brethren of England, that
our sincere and real Intentions are not to add fuel, nor bring oil, but
water to extinguish these lamentable combustions and fires, which we have with
so much duty and love labored to quench: That our taking of Arms is not to
make Wars (if we be not necessitated) but to obtain a better grounded and a
more durable Peace, for enjoying of our Religion and Liberties in all the three
Kingdoms: and that the wicked (who are the unworthy authors of all our
troubles) being removed from our King, a right understanding may be established
betwixt his Majesty and his people. And as we have solemnly sworn to protect
and defend all who shall enter in, and adhere to this Covenant: So do we
certainly expect, that all our Brethren in England who are zealous for the true
Protestant Religion, loyal to the King, and faithful for their Country, will
join and concur with us in the most noble and just ways of procuring these
just desires: which being obtained, we shall be most willing and ready to
return to our native Country, esteeming it our greatest happiness, that Truth
with Peace may be established in all His Majesty's Dominions.

Arch. Primerose.
