KING JAMES'S LETTER TO THE FRENCH KING AN EXCELLENT NEW SONG
Tune of, Let Mary live long.
KInd Lewis, my Friend,
Since Things goes no better,
Here is a kind Letter,
Which to you I send,
to lay down your Arms:
For my conquering Son,
Will quite overrun
your Kingdoms, I fear,
He Will bring a vast Army,
He Will bring a vast Army,
to conquer you here.
Since Fortune does frown,
And sends none but Crosses,
How great are your Losses;
My Kingdoms and Crown
you will never regain,
Too late here I know:
For a powerful Foe
will shortly arrive:
Stout Boys of broad Britain,
Stout Boys of broad Britain,
fears no Man alive.
Still ever for Peace,
Lest sad Desolation
Should fall in your Nation,
Your Foes they increase
at Home and Abroad:
For Diffusion of Blood,
Makes my Eyes like a Flood,
through Rivers of Tears,
The Cries of the People,
The Cries of the People,
sore pierces mine Ears.
Our Coll'nels are killed,
And valiant Commanders;
By fighting in Flanders,
All Nations are filled
with the Rumors of Wars;
Which troubles me sore,
Let us freely give over,
since Fighting's in vain:
I long to see Europe,
I long to see Europe
to flourish again.
I cannot but own,
And still I will ever,
You Have done your endeavor
To ransom my Throne,
by powerful Arms;
You Have done what you can
For an unfortunat Man,
I ever have been:
Those that fight against me,
Those that fight against me,
does Victory win.
Since the Fates are decreed,
That my Son and Daughter,
Will ever hereafter
Still flourish indeed,
which will satisfy me:
One Branch They will give,
By the which I may live,
I Will freely comply,
That I am not for Fighting,
That I am not for Fighting,
no, no, no, not I.
Now here lies the Case,
The most I desire,
Is hence to retire
To some Holy Place,
to spend my last Days:
So Lewis, my Friend,
Let the Wars have an end,
and lay your Arms down:
I Am wearied of seeking,
I Am wearied of seeking,
the Scepter and Crown.
FINIS.
