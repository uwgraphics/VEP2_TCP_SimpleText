^ And e -- ver -- last -- ing Father art
^ by all the Earth adored.
^ To thee all An -- gels cry a -- loud,
^ To thee the Powers on high,

With all the Martyrs noble Host,
thy constant Praise recite.
The holy Church, throughout the World,
O Lord, confesses Thee;
That Thou eternal Father art,
of boundless Majesty.
Thy honored, true and only Son;
and Holy Ghost, the Spring
Of never ceasing Joy: O Christ
of Glory thou art King.
The Father's everlasting Son,
thou from on high did come
To save Mankind, and did not then,
disdain the Virgin's Womb.
And having overcome the sting
of Death, thou open'dst wide
The Gates of Heaven to all, who firm
in thy Belief abide.
PART II.
Crowned with the Father's Glory thou
at God's right hand do sit;
Whence thou shall come to be our Judge,
to sentence or acquit.
O therefore save thy servants, Lord,
whose Souls so dearly cost;
Nor let the Purchase of thy Blood,
thy precious Blood, be lost.
We magnify thee day by day,
and ever worship thee.
Vouchsafe to keep us, Lord, this day
from sin and danger free.
Have mercy, mercy, on us, Lord!
to us thy Grace extend,
According as for mercy, we
on thee alone depend.
In thee I have reposed my trust,
and ever shall do so,
Preserve me then from Ruin here,
and from eternal Woe.

Thy Gifts are manifold; thou writ'st
God's Laws in every faithful Heart:
The Promise of the Father, thou
do heavenly Eloquence impart.
Enlighten our dark Souls, till they
thy Love, thy heavenly Love embrace!
And since we are by Nature frail,
assist us with thy saving Grace!
Drive far from us the mortal Foe;
and grant us to have Peace within,
That with thy Light and Guidance blessed,
we may escape the Snares of Sin.
Teach us the Father to confess,
and Son, who from the Grave revived,
And, with the Father and the Son,
the Holy Ghost, from both derived.
With thee, O Father, therefore may
the Son, who was from Death restored,
And Sacred Comforter, one God,
to endless Ages be adored.

^ And raised in faithful David's House
^ Sal -- va -- tion which of old
^ Ever since the World it self began
^ his Prophets had foretold.
To save us from our spiteful Foes,
and keep his Oath in mind,
Which he to Abraham heretofore,
and to our Fathers signed;
That we, from Fear and Danger freed,
his Temple may frequent;
And all our Days as in his sight,
in holy Life be spent.
And thou, O Child, shall then be called,
God's Prophet, to declare
His Message, and before his Face
his Passage to prepare.
To give them Light who now in Shades
of Night and Death abide;
And in the way that leads to Peace
our Footsteps safely guide.
Magnificat. Song of the B. Virgin. Luke I. 46, etc.

^ Me blessed of God, the God of Power,
^ all Ages shall confess,
^ Whose Name is ho -- ly, and whose Love,
^ his Saints shall e -- ver bless,
The Proud, and all their vain Designs,
he quickly did confound;
He cast the Mighty from their Seat,
the Meek and Humble crowned.
The Hungry with good things are filled:
The Rich with Hunger pined:
He sent his Servant Israel help,
and called his Love to mind;
Which to our Fathers, heretofore,
by Oath he did ensure,
To Abr'am and his chosen Seed,
for ever to endure.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

^ And I believe in Je -- sus Christ
^ the e -- ver -- last -- ing Word;

Conceived by the Holy Ghost, and of
the Virgin Mary born;
By Pontius Pilate doomed to bear
most bitter Pains and Scorn.
Was crucified; and for a time,
both dead and buried lay;
Descended into Hell; and rose
to Life on the third Day;
Ascended up to Heaven; and there
at God's Right Hand is placed;
From whence he shall return to judge
the Quick and Dead at last.
I likewise firmly do believe
O Holy Ghost in thee;
The Holy Universal Church;
and Saints Community.
Forgiveness of repented Sins,
(through Christ our Sacrifice)
The Resurrection of the Dead;
and Life that never dies.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
the God whom we adore,
Be Glory; as it was, is now,
and shall be evermore.
Lord's Prayer.
To the 112 Ps. Tune. First Meter.
OUr Father who in Heaven art,
Thy Name be hallowed in each Heart:
Thy Kingdom come; may we fulfill,
Who dwell on Earth, thy heavenly Will,
With equal Cheerfulness and Love
As Saints and Angels do above.
Give us this day our daily Bread;
Us into no Temptation lead,
But with thy Grace preserve us still
From Sin, and every thing that is ill.
For thine the Kingdom and the Power
And Glory are for evermore.
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
The God whom all the Sacred Host
Of Saints and Angels do adore,
All Glory be, as heretofore
It was, is now, and so shall be
To Ages of Eternity.
Second Meter.
To any Tune of Common Measure.
OUr Father, who in Heaven art,
all hallowed be thy Name;
Thy Kingdom come; thy Will be done,
throughout this earthly Frame,
As cheerfully as it is by those
who dwell with thee on high;
Lord let thy Bounty day by day
our daily Food supply;
As we forgive our Enemies,
thy Pardon, Lord, we crave;
Into Temptation lead us not,
but us from Evil save;
For Kingdom, Power and Glory, all
belong, O Lord, to thee;
Thine from Eternity they were,
and thine shall ever be.
The Ten Commandments.
^ GOD spoke these words, O Israel hear,
^ what I shall now command,
^ Thy Lord and on -- ly God am I,
^ who with all -- migh -- ty hand
^ From Egypts Land, and from the House
^ of Bondage set thee free:
^ And therefore Israel, (1.) Thou shall have
^ no o -- there God but me.
2. Thou shall no graven Image make,
nor likeness shall thou feign,
Of any thing that Heaven or Earth,
or watery Deeps contain.
Thou shall not bow thy self to them,
nor outward Worship pay;
Much less shall thou, in Heart, adore,
and to an Idol pray.
For I thy God, a Jealous God,
the Father's Sin chastize
To third and fourth Descent, of all
who are my Enemies:
But Mercy do to thousands show,
and bounteously repay
All those who me sincerely Love,
and my Command, obey.
3. The Sacred Name of God thy Lord
thou never shall profane,
For God will them not guiltless hold
who take his Name in vain.
4. Remember thou the Sabbath Day
to keep with holy care;
Six Days for Labor thou shall take,
to finish each Affair:
But God, thy Lord, the Seventh Day
his Sabbath did ordain,
In which thou shall from every kind
of worldly Work refrain.
Thy self, thy Children, Servants, then,
from Labor shall be free,
Thy Cattle, and the Stranger, whom
thou take to dwell with thee.
For God thy Lord the solemn space
of six whole Days did take,
The Heavens, Earth, and Seas, and all
therein contained, to make;
But rested on the Seventh Day,
which for that cause, he blessed,
And sanctified it to be kept
a Day of holy rest.
5. Honor thy Parents, that thou may
both long and happy live,
In that blessed Land which God, thy Lord,
did for thy dwelling give.
6. From Murder. (7.) From Adultery.
8. And Theft thou shall forbear:
9. Nor falsely shall in any case
against thy Neighbor swear.
10. Thou shall, not covet House, or Wife,
or Man, or Maid of his,
Or Ox, or Ass, or ought whereof
he rightful Owner is.
Have Mercy therefore on us, Lord,
and all our Hearts incline
With Diligence and Care to keep
these righteous Laws of thine.

THE Nation being at this time much inclined to Psalmody, and the New Version
of Psalms having the Royal Allowance, and Recommendation of the Archbishops,
Bishop of London, and other Fathers of the Church; This Supplement was thought
Requisite to make up the whole Variety of Metres, that are in the Old Version,
with Duplicates to most of them, and Gloria Patri's: The want of which has
partly occasioned the Disuse of many excellent Tunes: All which Tunes and
Gloria Patri's, being printed in this Supplement, may so far accommodate those
who sing the Old Version, and be acceptable to those Persons who employ their
Faculty in the laudable and pious Work of Teaching Psalmody in either Version.
And for further Accommodation, here is likewise added, a Collection of all the
most usual Tunes both of Common Measure and Others.

When Time his Course has run.

To his blessed Name
with Praise and Comfort sing.

And my proud Foes,

To the Tune of the Old CXXV. The same Psalm. First Meter.
^ ALL who on Sion's God depend,
^ Like Sion's Mount shall still abide,
^ For as the Hills on every side
^ Jerusalem's fair Gates defend;
^ So his surrounding Arm,
^ Protects the just from harm.

The best of Saints, but never prevail,
To make their steady Virtue fail:
Or seek base means for their redress.

To all of upright Heart.

To crooked Paths, the Lord shall them
With Reprobates to Death condemn;
But Blessings for his Saints provide,
To make their troubles cease,
And crown their days with Peace.
GLOR. PATR.
TO Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
(The blessed Eternal Three in One)
Be Honor, Praise, and Worship done
By Saints and Angels sacred Host,
As always was, is now,
And ever shall be so.
To the Tune of the Old CXXV. The same Psalm. 2d. Meter.
^ ALL they whose Hopes on God depend,
^ Like Sion's Mount shall still abide;
^ For as surrounding Hills defend
^ Jerusalem on every side.

The Lord of Might,
His faithful People does embrace,
And with strong Arm,
From fear and harm,
Will always guard his chosen Race.

They shall not them so long oppress;
To make their Faith or Virtue fail,
And seek base means for their Redress.

Who love thy Word,
Do thou continue ever kind;
To each true Heart,
Thy Grace impart,
Let such thy constant favor find.

And wander in the Sinner's way,
The Righteous Lord incensed to Wrath,
Shall them with hardened Sinners slay.
The Lord of might,
Shall thus requite,
Those who against his Law rebel,
But Truth and Peace,
Shall never cease,
Amongst his faithful Saints to dwell.
Psalm LIII.
To the same Tune.

Within his Heart, "there is no God:
Corrupt they are, and all misled,
Not one in Virtue's way has trod.

From Heaven his Throne,
And all the Sons of Men did view;
One Soul to find,
Amongst Mankind,
Who his just Will performed, or knew.

All were become corrupt and base;
Not one that walked in Virtue's way,
Not one of all the sinful Race.

To that Degree,
Of Wickedness and Folly grown,
That they each Hour,
My Saints devour,
And God's Almighty Power disown?

At once with shame and Death surpised,
Their Carcasses on Earth were left,
Contemned of God whom they despised.

From his Abode,
March on, our Captive Sons to free,
Could we survey,
That glorious Day,
Then Isr'el's Joy complete would be.
To the Tune of the Old CXXVI. The same Psalm.
^ WHen Sion's God
^ Her Captive Sons from Bondage freed,
^ A pleasing Dream
^ It seemed, of what we long desired.
^ But when convinced
^ By happy Proofs, 'twas so indeed;
^ Mirth filled our Mouth,
^ And Joy our silent Tongues inspired:
^ Our Foes repined,
^ But were compelled to own
^ The wondrous works
^ Our God for us had done.

'Twas great, and most amazing strange;
What then should we,
For whom he wrought the happy Change?

The Remnant of our Captive Bands,
More welcome far,
Than Rain to parcht and thirsty Lands.

Although in Tears, shall come,
And bring with Joy,
a full-Ear'd Harvest home.
Psalm CXIIII.
To the same Tune.
WHen Israel, who
Had suffered cruel Bondage long,
From Egypt marched;
And pious Jacob's chosen Seed,
From Men who spoke
A foreign and offensive Tongue,
By Miracles
And most amazing Signs were freed,
The Lord of Hosts,
From Judah's royal Tent,
Through Isr'el's Camp
His Sovereign Orders sent:
The frighted Sea,
And Jordan's stream, shrunk back with awe,
The Mountains skipp'd
Like Rams, the lesser Hills like Lambs;
Why fled'st thou Sea?
Why, Jordan, did thy streams withdraw?
What terror seized
On you, O Mountains, that like Rams,
Ye skipp'd? and why,
Ye little Hills did you,
Like frighted Lambs,
Your Leader's flight pursue?

Well may thy Guilt make thee afraid,
Before thy Lord
And Maker's Presence to appear;
It Is time, high time,
That Nature's self should be dismayed,
When Jacob's God,
The mighty Lord of Hosts, draws near;

could cancel Nature's Law,
Turn Rocks to Lakes,
From Flint a Fountain draw.
To the Tune of the Old CXXVII. The same PSALM.
^ IN vain we build with vast Expense,
^ unless the Lord the Work sustain,
^ Our Cities watch and ward in vain,
^ Unless the Lord be their Defense;
^ In vain we needful Rest forbear,
^ and feed upon the bread of Care.

He does their daily Labor bless,
And crowns their nights with sweet Repose.

and sent as Piety's reward:
Like arrows in a Giant's hand,
to Parents Safety they afford:

with these defensive Arms, may stand
And bid defiance to his Foes,
Who him, at Law or War, oppose.
