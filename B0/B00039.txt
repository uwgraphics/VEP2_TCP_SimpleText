who has no qualities or shadow of change in him, but whose very being is
most mighty, most just, most merercifull, and therefore has made all things
good, and gouuerned all things well,

Qv. What is the blessed Trinity?

AN. Three Hag. 2.5, 6 1. John. 5.7. Math. 28.19 Ioh. 14.26. Gal. 4.6. 2 Cor.
13.13
persons distinguished by their proper difference, but not separated one from
another, because every one of them is one and the same God: Pro. 8.22. Ioh
1.1.14 24 1 Cor. 8.6.
The Father of none: Math 3.17 Luke 2.49.

2.12.
The Holy Ghost proceeding from the Father and the Son.

Qv. Seeing we were Ge^. 1.26. Ephesians 4.24. Col. 3.10.
were all in Adam made good, according to God his image, how and in what sort
are you corrupted?

AN. By the Eccle. 7.31. Romans 5.13.14.
willinge fall of Adam, I with all men in his loins, The corrupt (...) man.
deserved to be Ioh. ^.25 Ephe 2.1.
borne so dead in sin, as I can have no true seed or beginning of goodness
in me, until both (...) 3^.^^ 2. Cor. 3.3.
my stony heart be taken away and a new heart be wholly given me of God,
without whose especial grace (although I can by the common gift given to all
men, understand, reason, will, and desire) yet I have no power to Genesis 6.5. and
8.21.
incline or move any of these as I should do according to God his will.

Q. In what case stand you by means of this corruption?

AN. I am the Ep. 2.1.2
child of wrath and everlasting damnation.

Qv. What does the least sin, as every evil m^^^n, or the not perfect
co^^^^^ance in doing the whole Law of God deserve, both before and after
faith?

AN. That which the Apostle says, Gal. 3.10.
Cursed, that is, euerlasting^^ condemned as he, that continues not to (...)
which is written in the books of the Law.

Qv. Then can we not be ^^^^sled, that is, acqu^^^ed before God ^is judgment
seat, by those ^^od works, which proceed from faith?

AN. No: for the most worthy obedience of Abraham, coming from his faith, did
not justify him, but only Ro^. 4.3.4.5.
his faith which was accounted to him for righteousness: And if the Lord will
mark what is done amiss by his righteous servant, Psa. 130.3. and 143.2.
who can abide it?

Qv. How are we then acquitted before God his judgment seat?

The restoration of man in Christ.
AN Only by the imputation of Christ his death and obedience, Gal. 3.13. 2.
Cor. 5.21. Esai. 53.3.4.
who was made a curse to redeem the elect from the curse of the law, who
knowing no sin, was made sin for the elect, that is, had all their sin so
accounted to him, as that he might bear the punishment of it: to this end,
that they might by the same way, be made God his righteousness in him, not in
them selves.

Qv. How can we be made partakers of this justification in Christ Ioh. 17.2.3
1. Ioh. 5.7. Romans 1.31. and 9.5.
after we know one God and three persons, the Father, the Son, and the holy
Ghost: and that Christ is perfect God and perfect man?

AN. Only by 2 Timothy 1.3 Tit. 1.1. Gal. 3.26.27 Ephe. 3.17.
the unfeigned faith of the elect, which is that faith, whereby we are able to
receive Christ.

Qv. How do ye know that ye have that faith?

AN. By the true mark which the Apostle gives, saying: 2 Cor. 13.5.
Prove your selves, whether ye be in the faith or no, whether Christ be in you
or no.

Qv. How may we know Christ to be in us?

AN By the three 1. Ioh. 5.6.7.
benefits wherewith he comes unto us, blood, water, and spirit.

Qv What is meant by Blood?

AN. l. Pe. 1.2.3. Romans 4.25. Act. 20.28.
Our justification consisting in Christ his righteousness, and the forgiveness of
sin by his bloud-sheadding.

Qv. What is meant by Water?

AN. Our Heb. 10.22 Tit. 2.11.12
sanctification, when the grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness,
unrighteousness, and worldly lusts, to live godly, righteously, and soberly in
this present world.

Qv. How shall we know that we feel both this true mortifying or denying of
sin, and true living to righteousness?

AN. When both from a true 2. Co. 7.11 1. Pet. 4.2
sorrow according to God, for every thing we know forbidden of God (yea the
least) as all light oaths, idle words, profitable lies, or vain actions, we
feel a study to avoid the first motions to them, a clearing of our selves
from all suspicion of them, by anoyding all appearance of evil, an indignation
for all such things past, a fear, least such things by our corruption should
fall out again: a great desire to prevent them: a zeal against them, and a
punishinge of them by exercising all due authority which God has given us
against sin: as also a great study to spend all the rest of our time, not
according to the will of men, but according to the will of God.

Qv. What is meant by the Spirit?

AN. That full assurance which the Gal. 4.6. Ro^. 8.15.16. Ep. 1.13.14. and
4.30. 1. Pet. 1.5.
Holy Ghost works in our hearts that we are God his children, whereby we
are sealed unto the day of redemption, that is, fully assured that we shall be
kept by the power of GOD through faith unto salvation.

Qv. By what ordinary means is that true faith and that which follows it,
wrought in us?

AN. By the preching of the gospel. The means of the working, exercising,
confirming, and increasing of faith, and the fruits of it.
Ro^ 10.14

Qv. What is the cause that so many hear the preaching of the Gospel, yea
do receive it wit^ some Ma. 13.20 21. Heb. 6.4.5.
taste, joy, and understanding, and yet obtain not this faith and the fruit of
it?

AN. Matt. 11.25.26. Luke. 11.34 Act. 13.48. Romans 8.30. To 9.11.12 18.22.23.
Ephesians. 1.4.5. 1. These. 5.9. 2. The. 2.13 1. Pet. 2.8. Iud. 4.
The cause is the unchangeable purpose of God from before all beginninges,
wherein he has (being moved only by his own holy will) appointed freely to
choose some to Christ unto salvation through faith, for the praise of his rich
grace: And justly to cast away others, when they should by their own default
deserve the same. Now this foundation stands sure, and has this seal, that
the Lord knows who are his: but for our own assurance, Let every one
depart from iniquity which calls on the name of Jesus.

Qv. What means besides the service of God at home, must we chiefly use, to
exercise, confirm, and nourishe this faith and the fruits thereof?

AN. We must diligently use all the works of the public Ministry, which are
prescribed of God, Act 2.42. To 12.5.6.7 1 Cor. 12.28
as prayer, doctrine, exhortation, the Sacraments, and communicating unto the
poor.

Qv. What is a Sacrament?

AN. It is 1. Cor. 12.13. 1. Pet. 3.21. Romans 4.11.
a seal wherein by the outward and public works, respecting both the
Minister and the Church, prescribed of God, and joined with the inward works
aunswering unto them, is more (then in the word only preached) lively
represented, and truly offered unto all, but assuredly aplied to the true
members of Christ only, Christ Jesus and the covenant of grace, fully ratified
in him. For the lively representing they are called signs: for the effectual
assuring and applying seals.

Qv. What are the outward works?

AN. They are Ma. 28.19. Act. 2.42 and 19.4.5. and 20.7. Ephe. 5.26. Act.
22.^6. Ma 16.26.27 1. Co. 10.16 17. and 11.23 24.25.26.
for the Minister, first to put apart the outward element or sign, by opening
the institution and covenant of God, by praying and giving thanks. Secondly,
to apply the same as is commanded. Lu. ^.59. Act. 2.42. 1. Co. 10.16 17 and
11.22.
For the people to join in hearing and prayer, and to have this sign so
applied. 1 Co. 10.1 2.3 and 12.13
Now of Sacraments, there are only these two: Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Qv. What is Baptism?

AN. Mat, 3.11. Act. 22.16. 1. Pet. 3.21. To. 6.1. etc.
The first Sacrament, wherein by the Ministers once washing with water, into
the name of the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, is more firmly applied,
Christ his once ingrafting of us into himself, for the washing of us by the
holy Ghost, for our full justification and continual sanctification in his
righteousness, death, burial, and his resurrection.

Qv. What is the Lords Supper?

AN. Matt. 26.26.27. 1 Co. 10.1.2.3.15.16.17. 1 Cor. 12.1^
The second Sacrament, wherein by the Minister his putting apart, his breaking
pouring forth and giuinge of bread and wine, by the Churches receiving, eating
and drinking of the same, the faithful have more fully applied their daily
and more effectual receiving by faith, of the body and blud of Christ, for the
spiritual nourishing of their souls in justification and sanctification unto
eternal life.

Qv. When we come to the Supper of the Lord, how must we prepare our selves
before, behave our selves in the present work, and reap fruit by it
continually after?

AN. Esa. 66.2.^ 1. Co. 11.28 31. and 10.1.2 2 Chr 30.19 ^. Cor. 13.5 Psa.
29.3.4. Ma. 5.23.24
Before we must try our says and repentance, not only whether they be true,
but also how we grow in them, what is the dullness and weakness of them, that
we may the more fervently seek the quickening and strengthening of them in this
Sacrament. In the present work, we must have 1. Cor. 10.16. with Ioh. 17
1.2.3. etc.
in every outward action, the inward feeling of that which is signified by it,
as in the putting apart of the bread and wine, we must feel more assuredly,
that Christ's body and blood was put apart by his prayers, to be the food of
our souls: Mark. 14.24. 1. Co. 11.24 Esai. 5.3.5.
by the breaking of the bread, and pouring forth of the wine, that his body was
crucified. and his blood shed for us: by the giving and receiving 1. Co.
10.15.16 and 11 23.24.25. Mark. 14.2^.23.24.
of them, that his body and blood is presently more lively given unto us, and
received by faith, 1. Co. 10.2.3. 1. Co. 12.13. Mat. 14.22.23.24.25, 26 Psalm.
26.7.8
by the eating and drinking, for the nourishinge of our bodies, that our souls
so joyfully feed on Christ by faith, as we are more fully assured of the
forgiveness of all, especially particular sins, of greater grace to leave
them, of eternal life in soul and body, as we do with heavenly
consolation, singe praises unto God, for the redemption of the world. After, by
the meditation hereof, Psa. 51.6. Can 2.5. 2. Co. 13.3.4.5.
we must be strengthened in all temptations, which are against our
iustifictio^ and sanctification.

The means of ^ecoueringe a ^inner.
Qv. What means are left to recover those sinners which are fallen into any
sin known to man, whom the preachinge of the word of it self does not
reform?

AN. ^. Math. 18.^5.10. ^ am. 5.16.^9.
Th^re are left for piuate offenses (that is, such as are observed of us, and
not otherwise notorious) private admonition: first by our selves, and if that
work not reformation, in the presence of one or two more. Mat. 18.16.17. 1.
These. 5.12 Romans 12.6.7.8. 1. Co. 12.28 Heb. 13.17.
For public offenses, (of which sort also are private offenses where
amendment follows not the second degree of admonition, the same being
declared to the Gouuernours of the same particular Church,) the rebukes and
exhortations of the Ministers and Elders. If that work not amendment, 2. The.
3.14. 1. Co. 5.11. Luke 6.22. Genesis 4.2.3.4 Job. 42.7.8. Iere. 36.5. Ma. 5.23.24
1. Co. 11.28 Nu 14.42.44
A markinge of them out by separatinge them from the Communion. And last of
all, if they amend not by that Ma. 18.1^ 1. Co. 5.1.7 3. etc. Genesis 17.14.
Leuit. 7.25.26.27. Heb. 10.8. Number. 19.13 Gal. 5.12. 1. Tim. 1.1^
after orderly notifying it to the Church with the consent of the same, which
is when no just exception is taken, Exco^municatio^, or delivering to Satan,
for the destruction of the flesh, and saving of the spirit in the day of the
Lord: so that upon good tokens of repentance, and public confession, 2. Cor.
2.6.7.8. etc.
he be received into the Church again.

COLOS. 3.16. Let the word of God dwell plenteouslie in you with all wisdom,
teaching and admonishing your own selves in Psalms and Hymns and spiritual
Songs, singinge with a grace in your heart to the Lord.
