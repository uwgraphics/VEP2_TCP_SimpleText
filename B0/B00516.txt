Country: With his bad tertainment at each several place, and^

man with animal and human figures around him

ROBIN CONSCIENCE: His Progress through the Court, City, and Country.
I Have bin quite through England wide,
With many a faint and weary stride,
To see what people there abide,
that loves me.
Poor Robin Conscience is my name,
Sore vexed with reproach and blame,
For all where ever yet I came
rep^^ve me.
Few now endure my presence here,
I shall be banished quite I fear,
I am despised everywhere,
and scorned.
Yet it is my Fortune now and then
To meet some good woman or man.
Who have (when they my woes did scan)
sore mourned.
To think that Conscience is despised,
Which ought to be most highly prized:
This trick the Devil has devised
to blind men.
Cause Conscience tells them of their ways,
Which are so wicked now a days,
They stop their ears to what he says,
unkind men.
I first of all went to the Court,
Where Lords and Ladies did resort,
My intertainment there was short,
^
As soon as ere my name they heard,
They ran away full sore afraid,
And thought some Goblin had appeared
from hell come.
Consciene quoth one, be gone with speed,
The C^u^^ few of thy name does breed,
We of ^hy presence have no need:
be walking.
Tho^ tel'st us of our pride and lust
Which ^pite of thee we follow must:
So out of Court was Conscience thurst,
no talking.
Thus vanished from the Court I went
To Westminster incontinent.
Where I (alas) was sorely shent
for coming,
The Lawyers did against me plead,
It was no great matter some there said,
If Conscience quite were knocked in the head,
then running
From them I fled with winged haste
(They did so threaten me to ^aste,)
Thought it was vain my breath to waste
in Counsel.
For Lawyers cannot me abide,
Because for falsehood I them chide,
And he that holds not on their side,
must down still.
Unto the City hyed I then,
To try what welcome there is Trads-men
Would give poor Robin Conscience, when
I came there
The shop keepers that use deceit
D^d come about me and did threat,
Unless I would be gone, to beat
me lame there
And every one both high and low
Held Conscience as a mortal foe
Because he does ill vices show
each minute:
Therefore the City in uprore
Against me rose, and me so tore
That I am resolved I Will never more
come in it.
On Friday I to Smithfield went
Where being come incontinent
The Horse coursers with one consent
did chide me:
They said that I was not my self
And said that I was a pinching else
And they could get more store of pelts
beside me,
I told them of a cheating trick,
Which makes the Horses run and kick,
By putting in an Eele that is quick
i th belly.
Another which they use full often
To bear their lame Iades heads aloft.
And beat their buttocks till they are s^ft,
as Ielly.
I told them yt their wealth would rot,
That they be cheating men thus got,
But they for this same tale would not
abide me,
And charged me quickly to be gone,
Quod they, of Conscience we use none,
Those whom I follow with my moan,
out-ride me.
From thence I stepped into Long-lane,
Where many Brokers do remains,
To try how they would intertaine
poor Conscience,
But my name when I them told,
The women did begin to scold,
The men said they that word did bold
^
For Conscience is so hard a word,
That scarce a Broker can afford
To read it, for his mouth is stored
with lying.
He knows not what this Conscience means,
That is no cause unto his gains,
Thus I was scorned for my pains,
all crying
Away with Conscience from this Lane,
For we his presence do disdain,
They said, if I came there again,
among them,
They said they would bang me back and side,
Being menaced thus away I hide:
Thus worldlings think that when I chide
I wrong them.
Among the Butchers then went I,
As soon as ere they did me spy,
They threatened me most spightfully
to kill me.
Quoth one, if Conscience here should dwell
We were not able to live well,
Nor could we gain by the meat we sell,
nor will we
Be bound to follow Conscience nice,
Which would confine us to a price,
Robin, be ruled by my advice,
quoth he then,
And get thee to some other place,
We hate to look thee in the face,
I hearing this, from thence apace
did fly then.
To New gate market went I then,
Where Countrey-women, maids and men,
Were selling needful things, and when
they saw me;
^ me one Butter woman railes.
Another comes and with her nails,
did claw me.
The Bakers which stood in a row
Began to brawle at me also;
And charged me away to go,
because I
Told them that they would make lesser bread,
Did not the Law put them in dread,
There Is some of them would wish them dead
might laws dye.
Thus chid of them my way I took
Unto Pie corner, where a Cook
Glaunc't at me as the deele did look
ore Lincoln.
Conscience, quoth he thou shewst no wit
In coming to this place unfit.
I Will run thee through with a spit:
then think on
These words to thee which I have said
I cannot live well by my trade,
If I should still require thy aid
in selling,
Sometimes one joint I must cost thrice,
Ere I can sell it at my price,
Then here is for thee (who art so nice)
no dwelling,
Perforce he drove me backwards still
Until I came unto Snow-hill,
The Sale-men there with voices shrill
fell on me:
I was so irksome to their sight
That they conjured me to flight,
Or else they swore (such was their spite)
they would stone me.
At Turn-againe-Laine the Fish wives there
And wenches did so rail and swears.
Quoth they no Conscience shall come here*
we hate him: (...)
Their Bodges which for half pecks go,
They vowed at my head to throw:
No Conscience they were bred to know
but prating.
Away thus feighted by those Scoulds,
To Fleet street straight my love it holds
Where men whose tongues were made in moulds
of flattery,
Did cry what lack you Country man?
But seeing me away they ran,
As though the enemy had began
his battery:
One said to others, Sir ill news,
Here Conscience comes us to abuse,
Let us his presence all refuse
together,
And boldly stand against him all,
We nere had use of him, nor shall
He live with us, what chance did call
him hither?
The Haberdashers that sell hats,
Hit Robin Conscience many pats,
And like a company of Cats,
they seracht him
Quoth they why come thou unto us:
We love not Conscience ruffling thus,
They gave him words opprobrious,
and matched him.
The Mercers and Silk men also
That live in Paternoster Row
Their hate against poor Conscience show,
and when I
Came to that place, they all did set
On me cause I their gain would let
Who will both swear and lie to get
one penny.
From thence unto Cheapsside I past,
^here words in vain (...)
Out of the place I soon was chased,
Quoth one man,
Conscience, for thy presumption base,
Intruding to this golden place,
Thou death deserve, therefore apace
be gone man.
Do think that we have so much gold
Before our eyes still to behold,
Will thus by Conscience be controlled
and curbed?
Oh no, poor fellow, half away,
For if long in this place thou stay,
Thou shall be (I le be bold to say)
disturbed.
From thence I turned down Bread-street,
A Cheese monger I there did meet,
He hyed away with winged feet
to shun me.
How now quoth I, why run you so?
Quoth he, because I well do know,
That thou art Conscience my old foe,
thou'st done me
Great wrong, while I made use of thee
And dealt with all men honestly,
A rich man I could never be;
but since then
I banished have thy company,
And used deceit with those that buy,
I thrive, and therefore Robin hie
thee hence then.
I left him with his had intent
And into Fish-street straight I went,
Among those Lads who wish that lent
were all year:
As soon as ere they me espied,
They all at once upon me cride,
And swore that Conscience should not guide
(...) there
I seeing things thus seeming strange,
That all men did from goodness range
Did hie me straight to the Exchange,
a Merchant
Was so affrighted when I came,
But presently he blushed for shame,
His countenance did show the same
in searchant.
Quoth he friend Robin, what do thou
Here among us Merchants now,
Our business will not us allow
to use thee.
For we have traffic without thee
And thrive best if thou absent be:
I for my part will utterly
refuse thee.
I being thus abused below
Did walk up stairs where on a row
Brave shops of ware did make a show
most sumptuous.
But when the shop-folke me did spy
They drew their dark light instantly
And said in coming there was I
presumptuous.
The gallant Girls that there sold knacks
Which Ladies and brave women lacks,
When they did see me they did wax
in choler.
Quoth they, we nere knew Conscience yet,
And if he comes our gains to let
We'll banish him he will here not get
one Scholar.
I being feered thus and scorned,
Went down the stairs, and sorely mourned,
To think that I should thus be turned
a begging.
To Gracious-street I went along,
Where dwell a (...)
That will deceive both old and young,
with cogging:
As Drapers, Poulterers, and such
Who think they never get too much
The word Conscienc to them is Dutch,
or Spanish.
And harder too, for speech they will learn
With all their heart to serve their turn:
But Conscience (when they him discern)
they banish.
I seeing all the City given
To use deceit in spite of Heaven,
To leave their company I was driven
perforce then.
So over London Bridge in haste,
I hist and scoft of all men, past,
Then I to South w^rk took at last,
my course then.
When I came there, I hoped to find
Welcome according to my mind,
But they were rather more unkind
then London:
All sorts of men and women there,
Asked how I durst to them appear,
And swore my presence they would clear
abandon.
I being sore a thirst, did go
Unto an Alehouse in the row,
Meaning a penny to bestow,
in strong Beer.
But cause I for a quart did call,
My host is swore she would bring me small
Or else I should have none at all,
thus wronged there,
I bad her on her License look,
Oh sir, quoth she, you are mistook,
I have my Lesson without book,
^
If I my License should observe,
And not in any point to swe^ve,
Both I and mine alas would starve,
not surfeit
In stead of the quart pot of Pewter,
I all small iug^, and need no tutor:
I Quartridge give to the Geometer
most duly,
And he will see, and yet will be blind,
A knave made much on will be kind;
If you be one, Sir tell your mind,
no truly.
No, no, quoth I, I au^ no Knave
No fellowship with such I have,
My name is Robin Conscience brave,
that wander
From place to place, in hope that some
Will as a servant give me room:
But all abuse me where I come,
with slander.
Now when my hostess heard me fell,
My name, she swore I should not dwell
With her, for I would make her sell
full measure.
She did conjure me to depart:
Hang Conscience, sates she, give me art,
I have not got by a penny a quart
my treasure.
So out o'th doors I went with speed;
And glad she was to be thus freed,
Of Conscience, that she might speed
in frothing
Into the Kings Bench I needs would go,
The Iaylor did me backwards throw;
Quoth he, for Conscience here you know
is nothing
Through Black-manstreet I went where
Stood gazing (...)
There two or three bawdes against me rores
most lowdly,
And bad me get me hence apace,
Or else they'de claw me by the face:
They swore they scorned me and all grace
most proudly.
I walked in S. Georges Field
Where ^ooking Rascals I beheld
That all the year their hopes do build
on cheating:
They were close playing at nine pins.
I came and told them of these sins:
Then one among the rest begins,
entreating,
That I would not torment them so:
I ^^ld them that I would not go:
Why then* quoth he, I let thee know,
we care not
And yet we'll banish thee perforce:
Then he began to swear and curse
And said, prat on til thou art hearse
and spare not,
I left them in their wickedness,
And went along in great distresss
Bewailing of my bad success,
and spied
A windmil standing there hard by,
Toward the same then passed,
But when the Miller did me spy
he cried,
Away with Conscience I Will none such,
That smell with honesty so much,
I shall not quickly fill my hutch
by due tole.
I must from every bushel of meal,
A peck, if not three gallons steal,
Therefore with thee I will no deal
thou true soul.
Then leaving City, skirts and all,
Where my welcome it was but small,
I went to try what would befall
ith Country.
There thought I to be entertained:
But I was likewise there disdained,
A long time bootlesse I complained
toth' Gentry.
And yet no service could I have,
Yet if I would have played the Knave
I might have had maintenance brave
among them.
Because that I was Conscience poor,
Alas they thrust me out of door,
For Conscience many of them swore,
did wrong them.
Then went I to the Yeomanry,
And Farmers of the Country,
Desiring them most heartily
to take me;
I told them I would sell their corn,
Unto the poor: but they did turn
Me out of doors and with great scorn,
forsake me,
One said he had no use of me,
To sell his corn, for I quoth he
Must not be only ruled by thee
in selling.
If I shall Conscience entertain,
He Would make me leave ingressing gain,
Here is for thee I tell the plain,
no dwelling.
Thus from the rich men of the world,
Poor Conscience up and down is hurled
Like angry Curs at me they snarl'd
and checked me,
Alas what shall I do, thought I,
(...) Robin must I starve and (...)
I that I must, if no body
respect me.
At last I to my self bethought,
Where I must go: and heaven brought
Me to a place where poor folks wrought,
most sorely.
And there they entertained me well,
With whom I ever mean to dwell,
With them to stay, it thus befell
though poorly.
Thus people that do labor hard,
Have Robin Conscience in regard;
For which they shall have their reward,
in Heaven.
For all their sorrow here on Earth,
They shall be filled with true mirth,
Crowns shall to them at second birth
be given.
And all those Caitiffs that denied
To entertain him for their guide,
When they by Conscience shall be tried,
and judged,
Then will they wish that they had used
Poor Conscience whom they have resus'd,
Whose company they have abused,
and grudged.
Thus Robin Conscience that has had
Amongst most men but welcome bad,
He now has found to make him glad,
abiding.
Among honest folks that have no lands,
But got their living with their hands,
These are his friends that to him stands,
and's guiding.
These still keep Conscience from grim death
And near gainsay what ere he says,
These lead their lives so here beneath,
^
They may ascend from poverty,
To Glory and great Dignity,
Where they shall live and never dye,
while frying
In hell the wicked lie, who would
Not use true Conscience as they should,
This is but for a moral told,
you in it.
He that observes, may somewhat spy,
That savours of divinity,
For conscionable folks do I
begin it.
And so I Will bring all to an end,
It can no honest man offend,
For those that Conscience do defend,
it praises.
And if that any gal'd Jade kick,
The Author has devised a trick
To turn him loose in the fields to pick
up Daisies,
FINIS.
