Imprisonment.

EDINBVRGH, Printed by JOHN REID, at his Printing House in Bells-wynd at the
head of the Court of Guard. Anno 1691.

A SONG for this sad Times composed by one of t^ now many Wanderers, when much
separated fr^ the Society of Men, and somewhat incommodat f^ other Works, to
divert him from vain Ravings, a^ for to Humble, and Recreat his own Spirit.
1.
I HAVE this while a Prisoner closs,
been without Liberty,
and some ti^ scarce accommodate,
as I had wont to be.
2.
But sure I should be well content
to lurk in hill's or cell's.
Who justly might long since have been
lodged in the lowest hells;
3.
And that for ills that I have done
already, (...).
Should I not in all reason be
well pleased with my lot.
4.
It is His Presence I perceive
that sweetneth every place
O that I could then evermore
seek His most blessed Face!
5.
Whereof but one smile, does the soul
refresh a great deal more,
Then Crowd of Friends, and of that sort
of Comforts greater store.
6.
This small Propine I have you sent,
a Coppie of some Lines,
For substance from experience drawn
and richest scripture Mines.
7.
Whose Fields abound with Treasure hid,
and Games of greatest price,
O but the Divine scriptures be
an excellent Device!
8.
Wherein GOD's Wisdom manifold,
it self does clearly show,
In suiting them to things and time
as if writ just but now.
9.
Did CHRIST'S Word in us richly dwell.
to one another we
In Psalm's, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs,
admonishers might be.
10.
And though we sing the lowest base,
even of the sadest port.
Yet might they then in Quiver all
some sweet notes of Comfort.
11.
Of grief and joy together mixed,
we might fine Music make,
That would our souls some way from Earth,
to HEAVEN by transport take
12.
Where doubtless of sweet singers all
the very sweetest are,
Surpassing David, Jeduthun,
Asaph, and Heman fare.
13.
Their great long masters mate with them,
but like school Boys would be,
Who learn the game, and their first notes,
sing with difficulty.
14.
Their Harps are screwed to highest page,
their voice sweet shirl and clear,
Amongst them all no jarr you will,
nor discord ever hear.
15.
Their songs above are all composed
of pure, but various joys,
More sweet then those on Organs played,
and song by men with joys.
16.
Our harps now hang on willows, and
by Babell streams we weep,
But then w'l sing, play, dance, and all
our holy measures keep.
17.
Disturbed much now are all our songs,
by (...), devils, and ill men;
But then in spite of them, we will sing
that Heavenly requiem.
18.
We here through sin, trouble and grief,
win scarcely one to croon
But then the Lambs songs we will chaunt too
that new Celestial tune:
19.
And common tunes with all their parts
as toys will be forgot
When that comes forth not heard on Earth,
all new in every note.
20.
Those Harpers on the sea of Glass,
will make such divine sound,
That thence against the echo will
about the throne abound.
21.
Where siteth GOD, and Christ, the Lamb,
in robs of Majesty,
Surrounded with the elders grave,
who always ravished be.
22.
Them to behold, and cannot those,
But still to chaunt and sing,
That vision blessed, fresh matter does
of new song say them bring:
23.
When all heavenly Quiristers,
shall each their own part sing,
That confort rare of voices sweet,
will make GODS temple ring.
24.
Sad as I am me thinks I am fain
their melody to hear,
Shall I once be a member of
that sweetly warbling queer.
25
When I through cold and darkness was
forced to ly much on bed.
I to this song by providence,
as by the hand was led,
26.
Which did from viewing vanities,
some what at least divert,
If not cheer up and humble too,
my sad, but yet light heart.
27.
I wished might have on you the same,
or some more blessed effect,
Such as it is, pray take it as
a pledge of my respect;
28.
But since it is the first I essay,
I have made of that sort,
I do expect, that you with it
the better will comport.
29.
When shall it once at last to me,
through grace to my lot fall,
From GOD above to have and hold
my expectation all
30.
If I within these bounds.
were happily confind,
Nothing I am inclined to think,
would thence forth cross my mind;
31.
If in him also I my self
delighted only still,
He would according to his word,
my heart desires fulfill:
32.
Though earthly comforts were dried up,
and all-together spent,
Yet his own all-sufficient self
would yield me full content.
33.
O! this a little heaven on earth,
would sure found for to be,
Unto a fainting sojurner,
like wandering weary me;
34.
But when I look to others arts,
dreaming to be made up,
It Is just I should be made to drink,
out of some empty cup;
35.
Where while I drunk my self I find
To be the dryer still,
Thus will it doubtless always be,
till he my heart shall fill
36.
For sisterns that no water hold,
can never satisfy,
The immortal soul enlarged desires,
and vast capacity;
37.
The gratest draught, but draught provoks,
and choaks the heart with thirst,
Yea to these cisterns hastes again,
more dry then at the first
38.
A Scripture truth most plain this is,
as any there contained,
And after thousands of essays
In ages all mantaind.
39.
Though I but little know of GOD,
and of his works and way,
Yet from the experience clear, I can
confirm this truth to day:
40.
For I two great ills did commit,
at which amazed may be,
And very desolat the Heavens,
yea frighted horribly;
41.
I Cistrens broke hewed to my self
that would no Water hold,
And living Waters Fountain did
forsake, how cannot be told!
42.
I am the Person, I must grant,
that foolishly did try
Waters to seek at Winter brooks,
which Summers drought does dry.
43.
For which I Am forced with Tames Troops,
confounded to turn back,
Since there of either strip or brook,
there is now no path or track.
44.
A Childish fancy sure it was,
to dream these brooks could bid,
When Persecuting heat should rise,
or trouble Men betyde:
45.
For which I am now made to drink,
as to my self I brewed;
On every serious thought of which
my sorrows are renewed;
46.
Like Succoths Men I Am also taught
as't were with thorns and brears,
Some Lessons not well Learned by me,
before in many Years;
47.
And therefore in displeasures just,
of trouble in this Day,
I with a sharp go get them, better
am by him sent away:
48.
That it is an ill and bitter thing,
I am now made to know,
From Him that is the Living GOD,
to have departed so;
49.
And that His Fear before mine eyes,
as it should not have been
Before me, now both grief and wounds
and most sad things are seen;
50.
About my neck wreathed by His Hands,
Is my transgressions yoke,
So hard that strange it would not be
though it my breath should choke;
51.
He bitter things against me writs,
and me possess does make
Of Youth and older age, the sins
for which my heart does aike
52.
In the light of His Countenance,
my secret sins sets he,
And with the fruit of mine own ways
fills heart, backsliding me.
53.
My feet He puts in the stocks,
and marketh narrowly
My footsteps all, and on my heels
a vive print sets He.
54.
He also, now alace! has made*
heavy on me my chain,
O! that his reconcilled Face;
might through these dark clouds shine.
55.
Prosperity I have forgot,
my soul's from peace removed,
I tempted am to doubt sometimes,
if ever He me Loved.
56.
That sin by all, this one World think
is now much mortified,
And that I am not to the World
a little crucified.
57.
But troubles great gone through may be
and sin as dead still ly:
Which yet may after make the Man,
oh, sin has slain me cry!
58.
The thorniest cross not blessed, but proves
like pricking of a pin,
Which will nor pierce, let be his heart
this Leviathan skin;
59.
Sharp pointed things in troubles mire,
spread under it may be,
And yet it not so much as groan
or move it self you will see.
60.
At sling-stones darts spears of the cross,
it laughs, and counts them stuble
Unto this day, it slain (...) hurt
was never by mere trouble.
61.
Nay it is courag'd sometimes and grows
more fierce, when these it prick,
And were it in the LORDS own hand
to spit, it would not stike
62.
As in our bodies humors, that
highly Malignant be,
All Cures not sovereign to reject,
and rage the more we see,
63.
For instance if we do call
of this thruch grave and sad,
Within, without, long since, and now,
too many may be had.
64.
The LORD may smile and hide His Face
yea, very angry be,
And yet we in our own hearts way,
go on most frowardly.
65.
No way there is with their mad hearts,
and desperate to deal,
Yet having seen our ways, that He
may gloriously them heal,
66.
GODS People in the desert, He
many strange ways did kill,
Yet notwithstanding of all this.
they sinned ever still:
67.
Nay some there were GOD surely struck,
yet they transgressed the more,
And sin is now as loath to die,
as then, or long before.
68.
Sin may with Men to troubles great,
to Prison, Bonds Exile,
Yea't may be to a scaffold go,
and yet live all the while.
69.
When I through fire and water both,
nay were I dragged through hell,
Yet that sin lived in strength, I could,
from sad experience tell.
70.
What are not souls of damned men,
tormented in extreme;
Yet sins so high, that now their work
is GOD still to blasphem.
71.
Nothing in HEAVEN, Earth, or Hell,
will make sin cease to live,
But grace alone, which still has this
for its prerogative.
72.
Since devils then find in HEAVEN, and they
with men in hell do so,
That naught but grace can sin subdue,
it is high time we should know:
73.
For since I walked without the Sun,
companion to Owls,
My troubles of that kind, that it
some friends affections cools.
74.
Most near Relations now from me,
He has removed far,
Former acquaintance also do
at my affliction scare.
75.
When GOD on's Peoples sins himself
begins once to avenge,
Amongst their other trials, then
the world grows very strange;
76.
Their Cross, though Christ for substance may,
by them also nicknam'd,
By friends which will them strangely tempt,
of it to be a shamed,
77.
Though by Men's judgment to be judged,
for us its a small thing,
Since GOD or long all blacks and whites,
forth to the light will bring.
78.
But here to stoup I am constrained
in midst of this complaint,
To tell that he is both good and kind,
which makes my grief relent,
79.
Some times he makes me hope, that all
my sins He will forgive,
And though that I be thrust at sore,
yet shall not die but live:
80.
And were it known what I have done,
what I have also been,
It would be wondered at, that I
should ever be forgiven.
81.
But what is in our eyes mavelous,
is nothing so in his,
Who in the pardoning of sin,
a GOD most matchless is:
82.
This art of favor and of grace
showed me, were it proclaimed
From misbeleif, all humbled souls
forever might be shamed;
83.
He sometime also visits me,
and asks me? how I do;
Come faithful friends he does provide,
that looks me well unto.
84.
Its taught, not talked, of love that works
most kindly simpathy,
That man so taught's the brother sure
born for adversity;
85.
This friend at all times loves, and is
more kind then any other;
Yea he is the very friend that sticks
more close then any brother:
86.
For sin I am made to possess,
months of vanity,
And nights that be right wearisome,
appointed are for me;
87.
In bed with tossing I am filled,
till dawning of the day
And then he mustereth up in view
my sins, in battle ray:
88.
Deaths terrors sometime me enclose,
his archers me surround,
And me my persecutors all
Between the straits have found,
89.
He in his sore displeasure has
sad things unto me showed.
And sometimes against me are, alace!
his witnesses renewed.
90.
But righteousness to him belong
and justly I Am thus served,
Yea punished far beneath, truly
what my sins have deserved:
91
And that I Am yet a living man
out of the pit should I,
Complain of punishment, tho great
for mine iniquity.
92
If I at last be saved, and get
my soul given for a prey;
Tho I through seas of trouble sweem,
I Am well come too I say.
93
Yet, O, He is a jealous GOD,
and on his children will
For their inventions vengeance take,
though pardon them yet still.
94.
For instance here, we may pitch one,
Moses the Man of GOD,
Who for's escapes at Meribah,
with his foot might not trod
95.
In Caanans Land, yea though to see it,
he prayed most earnestly;
Yet be content, says GOD, and speak
no more of this to me.
96.
By him, as the choice instrument,
even at the toutch of's rod,
Most dreadful signs and wonders wrought.
the great and mighty GOD.
97.
For Isreal's sins, full forty days,
the LORD he did entreat
Most earnestly, even all the while.
did nether drink not eat
98.
A Mediator typical,
'twixt them to deill did he
On Sinai, and so represent
Christ the true one clearlie
99.
The meekest man he was on earth,
my divine testimony,
In's own concerns, though in the LORDS,
even to hoofs peremptory!
100.
He faithful was in all GODS house,
and in his sight found grace,
To be his none such favorite,
and speak him face to face.
101.
And through his great converse with GOD,
the skin of's face did shine,
That none could speak with him, unless
a vail was drawn thereon.
102.
Nay, more with his own hands, the LORD
his body did interr,
And raised him up with Jesus Christ,
transfigured to confer.
103.
So many things so great and strange,
met never in one man;
Nor to this day his parallel,
the world afford none can.
104.
Accordingly the Spirit's pen,
his Epitaph thus drew;
No Prophet since like him arose,
whom face to face GOD knew:
105.
Yet he, even he, so rare a Man,
for one slip pays thus dear,
Is this not of GODS jealousy
a demonstration clear.
106.
Had our gross ills let be our slips,
such marks on them set now,
All hopes to see GOD this side Heaven,
would be cut off I trow:
107.
And very like it may so, with
this generation be,
That he in trouble waste our days,
and years in vanity.
108.
But free and sovereign grace, I grant
makes such Prognostics fail,
When not in common rule; but by
prerogative he will deal:
109.
And if with us he take not now,
this very sovereign way,
We Are gone, and in our sins we will*
and troubles pine away:
110.
He is so very jealous, that
his love cannot endure,
That any soul espoused to him,
should gade and play the whoor:
111.
Nay, such is his love jealousy,
that he will not be at peace
If such, but turn the least aside,
strange bosoms to embrace.
112.
And though it be most true, that he
putting away does hate;
Yet even for unchaste whoorish looks,
his dear spouse he will beat.
113.
This thought sometimes rolls in my mind
that this our age quite wrack,
That of GODS jealousy and dread,
there has been gross mistakes.
114.
The greatest rage of mortal men,
is sure their jealousy,
Wherein of the great gods, we may
some dark resemblance see.
115.
By this if Men be once enraged,
none may them stand before,
And this though mixed with love, yet makes
his Children dear to roar.
116.
By this if he be roused up,
and with his feet but stamp
On the most stout, or stupid spirits,
i^ puts a mighty damp
117.
His jealous frowns, his wrath rebuk^
for sin, man's beauty makes
Moth like consume, so vain he proves,
when wrath hold on him takes:
118.
As when he gives peace none dare,
to make trouble be bold;
So when in wrath to hide his face,
none can him then behold.
119.
Were all this and much more believed,
that told as truth might be,
To sport with what provokes his wrath,
so bold we durst not be.
120.
But who of's wrath the mighty power,
does know and understand,
Sure none, but such as are in's fear,
instruct with a strong hand.
121.
This is most sure, when sense of wrath
trysts with an other cross,
That man though dearly loved, yet will
be at a mighty loss.
122.
This does dump, fright, reel, confound
and put the man in doubt,
He can but cry, ah; now alase!
my sin has found me out.
123
For great infirmities sustain,
yea will the sprit of man,
But a wrath wounded spirit for sin,
who is he that bear can?
124.
GODS terrors, though a friend, will put
a man upon a rack,
And if they should continue long,
would him even distract.
125.
To crossed and werstling man knew we
what but one smile would yield
In troubles, this would most take up
to have GOD reconciled.
If I unfold could all the truth
on this concerning theme,
That written is upon my spirit,
as a bright sun beam.
127.
O child of GOD! thou would no more
from him to cisterns go,
But still cry out as most averse,
I Will no, I Will no, I Will no.
128.
This for the time I do declare,
should death me now approach,
For all these cisterns pits and brooks,
my soul in thirst should scorch:
129.
If but one scruple of his wrath,
were mingled in my cup,
The poison thereof, quickly would
even all my sprits drink up.
130.
What then could cisterns, pits and pools,
In such a choke availl,
When fire from heaven sent in my bones
against them would prevail.
131
It would within me doubtless raise
such Soul inflaming drought,
That all these could not yield what would
once cool, or wet my mouth.
132.
But Dives like, I should be forced
in that hate flame to cry,
O, that the least drop watter now
to cool my tongue had I;
133.
But one ways then my thirst to quench,
to drink life water ay,
Nothing this Fever heat to cooll,
but at life's well to stay.
134.
O, lingering time, run swift! take wings
flee quickly and be gone,
That I in HEAVEN with him may be,
and see His Face anon.
135.
There Cristal Rivers pure and clear
from under's Throne proceeds
Wherefore the first draught, surely would
quench all my thirst with speed,
136.
There would I drink and eke forgett
all by past misery,
And never more remember would
my former poverty.
137.
Then take their last Goodnight, would all
my jealousies and fears
And me for ever bid farewell,
all sighs, all groans all tears.
138.
To these the Lambs and Moses song
Triumphant would succeed,
That revelation would surprise,
my soul in very deed:
139.
For unto it light, life, and love,
would follow always no doubt,
And thence again would joyful praise
for evermore flow out.
140.
For at's right Hand most perfect joys,
and sweetest Pleasures be,
Make haste, make haste, Lord Jesus Christ,
O, bid me come and see!
141.
The Sp'rit and Bride did long since say,
Come, come, LORD unto me,
And thou again did make reply,
Surely I come quickly.
142.
Then for that glorious day, my soul
do thou long cry and call,
Wherein the LORD JEHOVAH may
to me be All in All:
143.
Till shaddows flee, and that fair day
shall break, and on me dawn,
Make me, O LORD, to live as thine,
and never more mine own!
144.
If thou at first did make and frame,
and then redeemedst me,
Should I not judge, I ought to live
eternally to thee.
145.
O, if to me to live were once,
most precious Jesus Christ!
Then death would unto me be gain,
and we should friendly tryst:
146.
Though death me found shipwrackt at sea,
or in a foreign Land,
At home in prison or in bonds,
or in the murderers hand
147.
Though it may meet in boots or block,
In gibbet, fire, or blood,
Even mank't or maimed, dismembered all
it would my friend stand good.
148.
For death by Christ, death's reconceil'd,
and will not friends annoy,
But to the place of the King
them wish and save convoy.
149.
Where what shall be our welcome home,
our best is to agree
To make a humble reference,
till we come there and see
150.
And when in that assembly, great
GOD this referr shall call,
Then what is neaven sight, will resolve,
more then did nearings alll
151.
We as amazed then will cry out.
the one half was not told,
Of all the glory that is here,
which now your eyes behold.
152.
As swallowed up in this great gulf,
words blushing will retire,
And thoughts tho schrew'd up to the height,
will then stand and admire:
153.
Nor so to speak, the object will
swelled to such bigness be,
That compast by conceptions arms,
unabled be will we;
154.
In sum, there we'll not sin, nor be
tempted to sin at all,
But as his servants do him serve,
so we then serve him shall:
155.
In our foreheads most lively then
shall His Name written be.
Like unto him we shall be made
and as he is him see.
156.
Then to believe and wonder, none
will need us to exhort,
That fight will ravish us, and as
in ecstasy transport.
157.
O! but the lively hope of this
strong influence, should have
Though men in Eden dwelt, to make
us long this world to have;
158.
Much more this blessed and glorious hope
would have a mighty stroke.
On the supportance of our sprits,
in this destress and choke.
159.
This loss of life and movables,
with forfaults of estates
This loss of money out in bonds,
with gifts made of escheats;
160.
This loss of dear relations all*
Let be a whiles divorce,
By tossings, wanderings, flights, exiles,
or what then these were worse
161.
Would make to be comported with,
for sweet Christ Jesus sake:
For whom we are bound without refer,
even all things to forsake:
162.
For him, I say, who did for us
come down from heavenly Throne,
And as a worm, and not a Man,
did creep his footstool on.
163.
His entrance first into the world,
was all its pomp without,
To justice as our surety then,
he very low did lout.
164.
For when to Bethlem Joseph goes
with his Mother, they are not able
A room to purchase in the Inn,
but they must to the stable;
165.
Where that blessed Child, she forth did bring,
and with her hands him swadle,
And in a manger did him lay,
having no better cradle:
166.
Of's birth the first news came not to
Kings, Nobles, Men of might,
But to poor Sheepherds, who were there
watching their flocks by night;
167.
And to this day few worldly wise,
Noble, or Great he calls,
But for the most part, the best lot
to meanner ones still falls;
168.
His Kingdom comes not with great show,
but glorious makes within,
Its now, and will be yet, as it
from its first rise has been:
169.
Though we in great winds, earthquakes, fire
would have him come with noise,
Yet often he is in none of these,
but in the still small voice;
170.
Though we, I say, would often have
him come the higher way,
Yet in the lower he delights,
himself much to convoy:
171.
In's Infamy to save his life,
to Egypt they are made flee,
And for his sake, all Bethlems Babes
King Herod made slain be.
172.
CHRIST's Kingdom is too often suspect,
as no great friend to Kings,
Which many of them, at the length,
of persecution brings.
173.
And this again does him provoke,
to plague sore these great ones,
And if they turn not at the last,
to overturn their thrones:
174.
For with thrones of iniquity,
by law mischief that frame,
No fellowship he will have, but will
as mortar tread the same,
175.
To loose the bonds of mighty Kings,
for him's no great attempt,
And on the Princes of the Earth,
to pour shame and contempt;
178.
Nay, he the Spirits of Princes great,
cuts off most easily,
And to the Kings that be on Earth,
most terrible is he:
179.
For of the Lords he is the LORD,
and of all Kings the KING,
When they are unking'd, he will gloriously
before his Ancients reign.
180.
O! that Earths Kings, to this great KING
would all once homage pay,
And kiss the Son, least in his wrath
they perish from the way.
181.
Though great Lawgiver, yet he was
made subject to the Law,
And of his Parents which he made,
when young he stood in aw.
182.
O strange! the everlasting Father
a Child and Youth to see,
And the great Potter, unto clay
stooping so rev'rently
183.
With him to worship when twelve Years
he to Jerusalem went
Betimes to show to keep the Law,
he in the World was sent:
184.
And that by going when so young,
for that end to the Temple,
GOD soon to worship, young ones might
be taught by his example.
185.
Thereby withal, right early he
GODS Majesty attones,
For our neglect of worship, when
we were yet younger ones.
186.
Once with the Docters then, and there
most gravely reasoned he,
That of's Prophetic office they
might have a preludie
187.
And that a Child might teach to Men,
How to manage debates,
And in all these might purge the sin
of their distempring heates.
288.
But what was done by him besides.
throughout whole thirty Years,
Wherein he lurked and lived obscure.
nothing in writ appears.
189.
Unless it be, that though he made
the World, and it adorned
Yet as a Carpenter to Work
With His hands he nothing scorned.
190.
That Lawful Callings He thereby
might to us sanctify
And us provoke to some of these,
GOD still to Glorify.
191.
And further more that guilt contract
by us from Day to Day,
In all our Lawful Callings might
be taken clean away.
192.
And these some four Years that to Preach,
he publicly appeared,
He made no noise into the streets,
his cry was ever heard.
193.
When doing greatest things, how often,
Tell no man, then said he,
Though when the least are done by us,
tell all men, cry do we.
194.
O! here to him we are most unlike,
who love so much the street,
And in our way to heaven, do make,
so greatnoise with their feet:
195.
One grace alace! we love to have,
by men's aplause sun shined,
And hence it comes to pass, that its
so withered, dried, and cryn'd;
196.
It also may be one great cause,
that faith has now such doubting,
That Christians of this have loved,
to be so much in outing.
197.
Did he not once, who could not err?
say how can ye believe?
Who in the air of mutual praise,
do love so much to live:
198.
And sure as no true faith can be,
where reigns this great ill;
So where that is prevails, the soul
with great doubts it does fill,
199.
O! When religion outrings all
to have, once we shall win,
As mere constrained results of grace,
in life and power within:
200.
Hereby this pattern blessed, we would
resemble very near,
who loved always to hide, but when
He forced was to appear.
201.
A longs his life, for's people he
of sorrows was a man
To make aquaintance eke with him,
sad grief betimes began.
202.
We read not he ever laughed,
but of the weept and groaned,
Men's sins, and their calamities,
is most sadly bemoaned,
203.
Him had you seen, ye would have said,
this in his face appears,
Who though but thirty four, yet looked
like one of fifty years;
204.
His visage more then sons of men,
so very much was marred,
We hid as't were, our face from him,
And at his trouble scared.
205.
No form nor beauty was in him,
unto the carnal eye,
Why he should be desired, and yet
even all desires was he
206.
To Atheism, to Devils Worship,
self Murder, Doubt despair,
Him for full forty days to tempt,
the devil did never spare:
207.
In all which great tentation,
sin did him never stain,
But he a victor absolute,
did constantly remain,
208.
These Worlds Prince came, but nothing found
in him to work upon;
For the only man he was in whom
of Satan's work was none.
209.
And such an High Priest undefiled,
us without doubt became,
Who separate from sinners was,
holy, and without harm
210.
Though sinless, yet he in all points
was tempted as are we
That when we are tempted, he to us
a succorer might be
211.
Such a High Priest we now have then,
with our infirmities.
Who will most fellingly be touched,
and with us simpathize:
212.
He Weary was, and Thirsty both,
he often laiked Bread,
Though LORD of all, yet had he not
whereon to lay His Head,
213.
He though most rich for his People
took on such Poverty,
That Women of their substance did
afford him some supply.
214.
He in the Garden heavy was,
and sorrowful to death,
In's Hand a Cup Justice did put
of sin reveanging wrath.
215.
At which amazed trembling he stood,
the Tears rushed in his Fyes
A grouf he fell on's face to pray,
and sometimes on his knees.
216.
And when the wrathful comflict grew,
wise Justice thinking't good,
Till he was in an agony,
and ^herein did sweet Blood;
217
He offered up more earnest Prayers,
with strong Cries, and with Tears,
To him who could him save, and heard
in what were then his fears.
218.
His suit unto his Father was
On Ground, yet prostrare still,
O let this Cup depart from me
if it be thine own will;
219.
Yet not my will, O Father dear,
But thy blessed will be done;
Since for the elect that it should
be thus, we grieved upon:
220.
Even for this cause, it was that
came to this darkest hour,
Of burning wrath, that I might stand,
between them and the stour,
221.
I Will heartily then drink this cup,
that these dear souls may be
According to Redemption past,
from it made ever free.
222.
He captive was, and Prisoner,
he also was in bonds,
He very roughly used was,
among rude Soldiers hinds.
223.
Before men's courts he was araigned
and there accused of Treason.
Yea for the same he was condemned,
against all Law and Reason.
224.
O strange the Just and Righteous Judge,
of all the World to see,
By wicked, and ungodly men
judged, and condemned to be.
225.
Amongst Thieves, and Robbers, he was ranked
nay, they to Him preferred,
That He was worse then any such,
the Churchmen still averred,
226.
He spit on was reproached, reviled,
and filled with mocks and scorns;
Yea, buffeted, and scourged was,
and also Crowned with Thorns.
227.
Off His blessed Cheek, plucked was the Hair,
He on the Face was struck,
Yet all this for His Peoples sake,
most Patiently he took.
228.
He Lamb like to the shambles was brought
never a Word did say,
But for his bitter enemies,
most earnestly did pray.
229.
A Purple Rob on Him they put,
in His Right Hand a Reed;
And but a mock of him they made,
who was a King indeed.
230
It Is hard now to believe that this
poor object Man was GOD,
Who as a Worm by villest men
was under foot thus trod.
231.
Stripped, and rackt on the Cross He was,
the space of three full hours
Where all the while of Grief and Pain,
He had sharp Fits and Showrs,
232.
His confidence in GOD and Prayers,
unto Him were cast up,
Which not a little to Him sure,
imbittered his Cup.
233.
When wrought with pain, he thirsty was,
and for some drink did call,
Nothing was then allowed on him,
but Vinegar and Gall:
234.
And which was yet more sad and strange
when very near to die.
He Is forced to cry my GOD, my GOD,
forsake why have thou me?
235.
Forsake he was as to what might
him sensibly comfort,
Though not at all, as to what did
him mightily support.
236.
All this He suffered, and was made
for thee, I say, for thee,
Believing soul, and will thou not
him love, and for him die?
237.
Ah! that about thy sufferings, thou
should with him thus debate,
Who of GODS fierce and flaming wrath,
for thee had such an heat.
238.
His sufferings were so great, that them
the Sun could not behold,
But as afraid, and blushing did
himself in cloud infold.
239.
The HEAVENS grew dark the Earth did quake,
the Rocks also were rent
At this strange sight, natures whole course,
out of course wholly went.
240.
Come suffering saints, for CHRIST come, come,
view ye the sufferings here.
They Are very many great and strange,
let all yours not despair.
241.
Be still, and of your sufferings small,
as great, talk ye no more
Like these on Earth, men shall again
be as were none before;
242.
Your greatest suffering of the Cross,
but very small chips be,
On his blessed shoulders sure did ly,
the great end of the Tree.
243.
By these most dreadful sufferings, was
the Elect peace porcur'd,
On him did light GODS wrath and curse,
which ye should ay endured.
244.
By these for you he also bought,
all sanctifying Grace,
With right to fellowship with GOD,
and sweetest sights of's Face,
245.
By his, yours all, for him are blessed.
and you thereby adorned;
By them your way is path'd to HEAVEN,
and you to him confirmed;
246.
Through sufferings he was made perfect,
and stepped up to his throne,
Through that same way, should ye not be
content to follow one,
247.
Come pledge him then in crosses cup,
for drunk't out was by him,
All dregs of wrath is now pure love,
from bottom even to brime.
248.
Nay so prepaird that spiritual health,
It keeps and does restore,
This Cup then take when it is propyn'd,
and scare at it no more.
249.
He by his sufferings of GOD's wrath.
the Wine Press trod alone,
Of all the people of the World,
to help him there was none:
250.
His Agony to see, it is true,
of's friends He took the chief;
But ah! good Men they helped not,
but added to His grief;
251.
And though their sins concurred, to bring
on him of wrath that shower;
Yet could they not be kept from sleep,
to watch with him one hour;
252.
But left him all e're long, and each
unto his own did go,
And one of them, alas! did swear,
the MAN he did not know.
253.
Here stop we may, and sadly mark,
what Men in Trials are,
The best, when left from following CHRIST,
a poor Maids voice will scare:
254.
Let us not then high minded be,
but fear and tremble all,
Least on the stage of Trial we
do catch some shameful fall.
255.
No weight be laid on our most sweet,
but yet untried resolves,
Which the tentations close approach,
most frequently dissolves:
256.
No stocks of grace, No by past helps,
no now warm fits we see,
Will after choaks sustain, but shrink,
without CHRIST'S fresh supply.
257.
If these Trials, then we would
be kept from all offenses
Let Us Fear, Watch, Pray, and humbly wait,
for Heavens new influences,
258.
In all Christ's sufferings here is the Word,
this suffering MAN was GOD
Emmanuel he was, who bare
of wrath, this heavy load.
259.
Let Men and Angels all admire,
how such a thing should be,
That GOD Eternal should be MAN,
and suffer thus and die!
260.
Let Reason stoup, stand by, and still
for ever, hold its peace,
As quite transcended in it is reach,
let it to Faith give place.
261.
Which yet none can that it is so,
in very deed believe,
But hardly can how it is so,
us satisfaction give:
262.
Here Angels intellectual Sprits,
love to be Scholars still.
And cannot at this mystery great
of wondering have their fill.
263.
Into it they with great delight,
do look, yea, dyve, and pry;
And yet they are not so much concerned,
as stupid thou and I!
264.
Which makes me think were it possible,
that Christ of's love could rue,
We would him tempt, our thoughts of it
and wondrings are so few.
265.
But here is the wonder great, which shall
of wonder ever be,
That He loves them, that cannot love,
O! but His love is free:
266.
And now because thou cannot love,
good news I pray thee hear,
The day's at hand wherein thou-shalt
behold love, and admire.
267.
Mean time for CHRIST take up thy Cross,
and bear it patiently,
Remembering what great things, and how
he suffered has for thee:
268.
For CHRIST, I say, take up thy Cross,
and be no more cast down,
For thou art now apparrent heir
of an immorral Crown:
269.
Which thou shall wear e're it be long,
and be enthroned in State,
Then thou'l be well, O! rarely well,
above reach of debate.
247.
Now unto him who loved us, and
from sins in's own Blood washed:
And the hand writing crossed to us,
naild to his Cross out dashed.
271.
Who from principallities, and power,
did us as spoil rescue;
And over them in it triumphed, and made
of them an open show.
272.
And to him who to this live hope,
has us begot again,
By raising Christ up from the dead,
all Blessing be: Amen.
FINIS CORONAT OPUS.
