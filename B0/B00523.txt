The Whoremongers Conversion,
And his Exhortation to's worshipful friend,
To leave haunting whores; from his words this wasptenn'd:
And at his request, which makes the Author bolder:
It is to be sung like the maunding Soldier.




GOod your Worship cast your eye,
Upon a whore-house scornfully
Let not their painted faces gay,
Drive from your heart all grace away:
but like a Neaphite,
abandon quite
all sensual pleasure and delight:
and then you soon shall find
a sweets contented minds,
and have your purse still better linde.
To beg I was not borne, sweet sir,
Yet this petition I prefer
Unto your worship: which may give
You good instructions how to live,
leave following of Whores,
and them that roares,
oh do not come within their doors,
and then you soon will find
a sweet contented mind
and have your purse still better linde.
I Would scorn to make comparison,
With a Jew, a Turk, or Sarizon:
That in their lives never tasted grace,
But still have run a wicked race:
yet in bad desires,
called Cupids fires,
they pass not you, then need requires,
that you your Whores forsake,
and better courses take,
or else you will feel the infernal Lake.
Then scorn those painted counterfeits,
That get their means by wicked sleights,
They Will learn you so much parley French,
From you shall come a rotten stench,
and at last you shall
be forced to fall,
^ith Surgeons hands, o'th Hospital:
there you shall lie and rot
this is by Whoring got,
then good your worship use it not.
For I (sir) limping lame have been,
Sore bitten by the Scorpiuns keen,
In a bawdy house I used to roar,
Till all my joints were pocky sore:
all this I have endured,
which vice procured,
and since of health I am assured,
I will do what I can,
to hinder every man
from that base course which once I ran.
Thrice thorou the skull I have been shot,
Till all my hair came off, God wot,
I have at least a doozen times
Been apprehended for these crimes:
the Constable and Watch
often did me catch.
thus I disgrace got by the match:
and so shall every one
that does as I have done:
then, good your worship, wenching shun.
The second part,
To the same tune.




AT pot and pipe I lost mine eye,
In quarrel most unluckily:
To old-street end, though then a lad,
Four wenches at one time I had:
oh you would little ween,
that I have been
a Champion unto many a Queen:
I have been beaten sore,
ith quarrel of a whore,
but now I will be so no more.
I coming from a play was taken,
By the Marshals men in Golding-lane,
And stripped out of money quite,
Exchanging Gold for Silver white:
thus in poor array
I hrisoner lay,
until my friends the debd did pay,
for a bond of my word I past,
and thus was scorned at last:
then good your worship live more chaste.
There Is no bad place that you can name,
But I have bin in it, the more's my shame;
In Turnbull street and Bloomesbury,
I have played my part most shamelesly:
at Blackman-street I have
like a lustful knave,
received what welcome harlots gave:
and at Rosemary lane
I did two whores maintain,
but now their baseness I disdain.
And since I have been at Cow-crosse
So punished with my Purses loss:
Since that at Pickt-hatch I by chance
Learned French of one that never saw France:
there I lost my cloak,
which almost broke
me quite: all this for truth is spoke,
and now I hom ame come
with a newly mended bum,
such hap Jove keep your worship from.
And now my case you understand,
Good sir, let me this boon demand:
That you will be warned by me, and leave
These damned Queanes that will bereave
not only you of wealth,
but bodies health,
nay that is not all, for they by stealth
will steal your soul away,
to be the devils prey:
then sweet sir, leave them while you may.
I pray your worship think on me,
That am a poor man, as you see:
Yet once I was with wealth indude,
Which I have spent with strumpets lewd
and so will you in time,
if this your prime
you waste away in such a crime:
but I for you will pray,
that you may mend this day.
Oh sweet sir, think of what I say.
M.P.

FINIS.
