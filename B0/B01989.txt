A Character of a true Christian.
Written by Abiczar Copp. The Tune is, The Fair Nimphs.

Love
A Christian true does love
his Father that is above,
His Brother that is below.
his Friends, and eak his Foe,
The Rich, the Poor, the great, the small,
the Strong, the Weak, he loves all.
Self-denial
He still denies himself,
not greedily gripes for Pelf,
Does neither pole nor pill,
his Chests or Barns to fill,
His Neighbors Good, not Goods, does seek,
he is honest, harmless, loving, meek.
Humility.
Not pust in mind is he:
all those of low degree,
Do never taste his Scorn,
the Base, the Vile, Forlorn:
He Is bounteous; courteous, loving and kind;
to all he bears a gentle mind.
Stability.
He still at home does keep;
and his own door does sweep;
Does not debase his mind,
in seeking Faults to find:
He picks no hole in Neighbors Coat;
nor strives in's Ey to find a Mote,
Forbearance.
His Lamb-like spirit does bear,
he does not fight nor tear,
Nor flounce, nor sling, nor fume;
but Meekness does perfume
His Soul, when he is injured;
Captivity is captive led.
Mercy.
His burning Bowels yern;
from thence his Eye does learn;
To still some oil of Right
into the wretched Weight.
His hand is fired by his heart,
his Substance to the poor to impart.
Charity.
His Charity is not small,
it does extend to all,
The bad and eke the good:
not like the formal Mode,
Who none but their own Sect endure,
this is from the Fountain pure.
Wisdom.
He wisely walks to all,
and to prevent a Fall,
He look before he leaps:
a narrow Watch he keeps;
When to speak, he well does see;
and When silent he is to be.
Peace.
His Principle is Peace,
in him all Wars do cease,
The sword and Gown may stand,
both distant from his Land,
He is endeared to great and small,
he lives in Love and Peace with all.
Obedience.
He marches in the Van,
to each Decree of man,
For God's sake he subjects;
to all he yields respects,
The Prince of Peace does Peace impart,
he hates all Plots with all his heart.
Freedom.
The Son has made him Free
from Aegypts Slavery,
From daily Brick and Task;
he needs no religious Mask,
Through Christ he all things does and can;
he is wholly the Lords free man.
Patience.
He bravely bears the Cross,
and sits down by the loss,
When Sabeans on him fall,
and Caldees take his all.
Not theie nor those, but God in Heaven;
he says, Has taken as well as given.
Content.
Soul-Killing Discontent,
where by pure life is spent,
And marrow melts away,
with him it cannot stay:
His Soul in Patience does possess,
for, Evil and Good the Lord does bless,
Resignation.
For wholly he is resigned
unto the Unconfined;
God's pleasure is his Law.
of that he stands in aw.
When Self is swept away and gone,
he says and lives, God's Will be done.
