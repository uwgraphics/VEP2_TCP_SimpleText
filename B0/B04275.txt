THE Good Fellows Consideration. OR The bad Husbands Amendment.
Here in this Ballad you may see,
What it is a bad Husband to be,
For drunkenness most commonly
Brings many unto poverty.
And when a man is mean and bare,
Friends will be scarce both far and near,
Then in your youth keep money in store,
Lest in old age you do grow poor.
Lately written by Thomas Lanfiere, Of Watchat town in Sommersetshire.
To the Tune of, Hey boys up go we, etc.






GOOD Fellows all come lend an ear,
and listen to my song,
To you in brief I will declare
how I have done my self much wrong
By spending of my money too free,
it brought me low and poor,
But now a good Husband I will be,
and keep my money in store.
It is well known the fudling-school
I have haunted many year;
I wasted my money like a fool
both in Wine and strong Beer:
With my Companions day and night
I Would both drink, sing, and roar,
But now bad company I Will slight,
and keep my money in store.
In the morning sometimes to an Alehouse I Would hye,
and tarry there all day,
Perhaps a crown or an angel I
at one recconing would pay:
My pocket of money I Would empty make,
e're that I would give ore,
But now such actions I Will forsake,
and keep my money in store.
My hostess she would smile in my face
when I did merrily call,
For why, she knew I would not be base,
but freely pay for all:
Before the Flaggon was quite out
she would be ready to fill more,
But now I mean to look about,
and keep my money in store.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
Sometimes she in a merry vein
would sit upon my knee,
And give me kisses one or twain,
and all to sweeten me,
She Would vow I was welcome indeed,
and should be evermore,
But now I mean for to take heed,
and keep my money in store.
Thus I frequented the Ale bench
so long as my money would hold;
Whilst my Wife and Children at home did pinch
with hunger and with cold;
So I had my guts full of Ale and Beer,
I look after nothing more,
But now I mean to have a care,
and keep my money in store,
My wife would often me persuade
and mildly to me say,
Good loving husband follow your trade,
and go not so astray:
But with soul words I*de her abuse,
and call her bitch and whore,
But now her counsel I will choose,
and keep my money in store.
At last through my lewd wicked vice
I had consumed all,
By drunkenness, with Cards and Dice
my stock it was brought small:
By keeping of bad company
I was grown mean and poor,
But now I Will leave bad husbandry,
and keep my money in store.
To my hostess one time I did repair,
and desired one courtesy,
To trust me for half a dozen of beer,
but she did me deny:
She told me she had made a vow
to draw no drink on score,
But I am fully resolved now
to keep my money in store.
Quoth. she, the Mault-man his money must have
also I must pay excise,
If I should trust every drunken knave
where will my money rise?
But if you have think you may have drink,
if you have none turn out of door,
But now from the Alehouse I will shrink,
and keep my money in store.
Thus all good fellows you may see
what it is to be in want,
A man shall not regarded be
if money is with him scant:
But if money you have, they will tend you brave,
if you have none they will give over,
Then he careful your money for to save,
and lay it up in store.
By experience it is plainly seen
in England far and nigh,
Those that rich wealthy men has been,
at last come to poverty
By spending too much in wine and beer
there is many does grow poor,
Then good fellows have a special care,
to keep your money in store.
If all bad husbands were of my mind
in country and in town,
The Ale-wives a new trade should find,
to pull their fat-sides down:
They should work hard, both spin and card,
we would keep them so poor,
And we would be careful our money to save,
and lay it up in store.
Now all you married men that are,
and Batchelours so gay,
Of the main chance pray have a care,
lest you fall in decay:
Be sure you time do highly prize
'twil not stay for rich nor poor,
Good fellows all I you advise
to keep your money in store,
Printed for P. Brooksby at the golden Ball in West-Smithfield.
