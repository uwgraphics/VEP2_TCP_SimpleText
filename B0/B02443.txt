The Covenant OR, No King but the Old King's Son, OR, A brief Rehearsal of
what heretofore was done.
All sorts of People of it take a view,
You surely will confess that I say true;
Let none mislike the same that cannot mend it,
Neither rashly censure him that penned it.
To the Tune of, True Blew will never stain.


LOng time have I been a Soldier,
and have followed the Train,
Which does make me now the bolder,
the Covenant for to maintain.
When first unto the Wars we went,
and Essex did us entertain,
It was then to a good intent,
though since we turned our coats again.
In every church the covenanting
our undertakings did explain,
Our endeavors were not wanting,
the true Cause for to maintain.
By the Parliament it was expressed
Kingly Rights for to maintain,
And if his Heirs they were distressed,
they kindly would them entertain.
Since many persons have repented
for their ki^ted that were slain,
Since the King this Land absented,
and did not return again.
Plate into half-crowns was melted
to pay the Soldiers for their Pain,
We then did march till we were swelted,
no to^e at all we did refrain.
Which makes me now call to mind
of remembrance this one thing,
Which in the Covenant I find,
To defend the Person of the KING.
But some will say I am a wigeon
because the truth I do maintain,
It was only for Religion,
and Opinions that were vain.
Religion it is confessed
Did wax then into the Waine,
As in the Covenan is expressed,
for which many men were slain.
We Soldiers that then were listed
the Good Old Cause for to maintain,
With good hopes we always feasted
to bring home the King again.
The Second Part,
To the same Tune.




HOwever that some have boasted,
the hazard of it we have run,
And through extremities have posted
For no King but the old Kings Son.
If any man claim Charles's Right
for whatever his Father has done,
Death on him has wrought his spite;
No King but the old Kings Son.
If he was of the Roman faction,
no favor here he should have won,
But now we are all in great distraction,
No King but the old Kings Son.
And moreover understand,
illuminations did us draw
To fight for our freedom, and
to keep our enemies in awe.
A Proclamation then was made,
which no person can deny,
And the world they did persuade
it was for th'Subjects liberty.
And afterward to make amends,
when three Nations were undone,
They were for their private ends,
the Soldiers lost, that all had won.
Then many thousands were disbanded,
which before had won the day;
Great Persons then dealt underhanded,
and deceived us of our Pay:
Which makes us now live discontented,
and repent what we have done;
By poverty we were tormented,
For no King but the old Kings Son.
If a single Person we must honer,
these Lands in union for to bring,
And must fight under his Bonner,
let us have our lawful King.
Great Jove unite our hearts together,
our Privileges to maintain,
And send us good and pleasant weather,
that our Righfull Prince may reign.
