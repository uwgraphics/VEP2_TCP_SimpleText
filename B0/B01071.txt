Joy and sorrow mixed together: Or, a pleasant new Ditty, wherein you may find
Conceits that are pretty to pleasure your mind.

To the tune of, Such a Rouge would be hanged.


HAng sorrow, let us cast away care,
for now I do mean to be merry;
We Will drink some good Ale and strong Beer,
with Sugar, and Clarret, and Sherry.
Now I Will have a Wife of mine own,
I shall have no need for to borrow:
I would have it for to be known,
that I shall be married to morrow.
Here Is a health to my Bride that shall be,
come pledge it you boon merry blades:
The day I much long for to see,
we will be as merry as the Maids.
I long have sought out for a Wife,
before that I any could see:
But now for to end all the strife,
I have found one that pleases me.
She is a brave gallant indeed,
besides she is loving and kind:
Good luck had I so well to speed,
she is according to my mind.
Here Is a health to my Bride that shall be,
come pledge it you boon merry blades:
To morrow's the day you shall see,
we will be as merry, etc.
Dame Nature has showed her Art
in framing my Love so complete,
She Is handsomely made in each part,
her like is not in my conceit:
Her hair it does glitter like gold,
her eyes like to Stars do appear:
She Is beauteous for to behold,
yet she is my joy and my dear.
Here Is a health to my Bride that shall be,
come pledge it, etc.
There Is many a one will admire,
how I should obtain such a Less:
But now she is mine, gold shall not buy her,
for ever I will her embrace:
Besides she is a friend that will give
ten pound to me when I am married,
This will maintain us while we live,
and if things be orderly carried.
Here Is a health, etc.
This man is a friend to my Less,
I doubt not but so he will remain:
He tells me what ere come to pass,
my labor shall not be in vain,
If he his own promise do keep,
it is likely with me to go well:
This makes me both waking and sleep
to think of my bonny sweet Nell.
Here Is a health, etc.
Now is the sad night overpast,
and day chearefully does appear,
To Church with my Nell I Will make have,
to void all suspicion and fear:
All you that will now go along,
I pray you not to use delay;
Delay oftentimes causes wrong,
I Am joyful of this happy day.
Now here is a health to my Bride,
come pledge it you boon merry blades,
And to all married couples beside,
we will now be as merry as the Maids.
Now wedding and all being done
and finished as he did desire,
The Company homewards were gone,
the Bride a bed, and he lay by her:
Some speeches there past them between,
which made him his bargain repent,
The next morning as it does seem,
the Bridegroom began to relent,
He Will now drink no more to his Bride,
nor yet to no boon merry blades;
Now he lays his joys all aside,
he is not so merry as the Maids.
The second part now makes the young man complain,
He wishes with heart, he were unwedded again.

To the same tune.


YOu young men I Am married too soon,
my Wife she is not what she seemed,
Alas I am now quite undone,
now sorrow comes which I never deemed:
In Wiveing I have made too much have,
I would the fast knot were untide,
If my wedding day were not past,
I would not be tide to my Bride.
I Am wedded to sorrow and pain,
now farewell all my merry blades;
Would I were unmarried again,
I would be as merry as the Maids.
My Wife's not what I thought she was,
the more is my grief and my care;
She proves to me but a cracked glass,
alas I am caught in a snare:
She was promised me to be sound,
but now I find it is nothing so,
Would I were rid of her ten pound,
so that I were rid of her too.
I Am wedded to sorrow, etc.
The man that did give me the money,
I doubt that he had the best share,
It seems he did love my sweet honey,
and still does so I greatly fear:
But now here is the worst of all,
my Wife she proves to be with Barn,
The Child it will me Father call,
although me it nothing concern.
I Am wedded, etc.
My Wife was with Child long before
that I married her, I do find,
It Is folly to say any more,
and yet it does trouble my mind:
If I ask her in loving sort,
to whom she her Maidenhead did give,
With words she does cut me off short,
saying, I shall never know while I live.
I Am wedded, etc.
What Man living can brook this wrong,
to Father another Man's Child?
Yet I were as good hold my tongue,
now I find that I am beguild:
With patience I must be content,
it is many men's Fortune like mine,
Now I have no way to prevent,
this I might have foreseen in time.
I Am wedded to sorrow, etc.
Before I was wed I nere thought
of any such matter at all,
I thought a great price I had caught,
but now my reward is but small:
It Is true indeed I have ten pound,
and a dainty curious fine Wife;
But had I known what I have found,
I would have lived a single life.
I^m wedded, etc.
Let young men take warning by me,
for Maidens are dangerous ware,
I have got a Wife and some money,
and yet I have bought her too dear:
For cunningly I am buguild,
unto all my Neighbors it is known,
Now I must Father a Child,
although it be none of mine own.
I Am wedded to sorrow and pain,
now farewell all my merry blades,
Would I were unmarried again,
I would be as merry as the Maids.
