The Cheerful Husband: Or. The Despairng Wife.
In a Dialogue between a loving Couple, about the Cares and Crosses of these
troublesome Times.
To the Tune of, The Jealous Lover.


Woman.
SWeet kind and loving Husband dear,
We shall be ruined now, I fear;
Such Times before, I never knew
Since I was born, what shall we do?
Our Charge is great and Profit small,
And Charity grows cold withal;
This fills my Heart with grief and care,
I nothing see but sad despair,
Man.
Cheer up, my kind and loving Wife,
The joy and comfort of my Life,
And do not in the least complain,
I hope to see good Times again.
Let us the while with patience wait,
Submitting to the hand of Fate,
Which will in time our Joys restore;
Then what can we desire more?
Woman.
Dear Love, I know you hope to see
Once more the Land's prosperity,
That Fortune will upon us smile,
But pray how shall we live the while?
Our Family is something large,
Six Child ren is no little charge,
For to be fed and clothed also,
Whether we have employ or no*
Man.
My Children they are Blessing's Love,
Sent from a gracious God above;
Then do not murmur in the least,
Content is a continual Feast.
God's Providence does comfort yield,
He clothes the Lillies of the Field,
And feeds the Ravens of the Air,
Then why should'stthou and I despair?
Woman.
But, Husband, Husband, she replied,
When I was made your lawful Bride,
I brought two hundred Pounds in Gold,
As good as ever Merchant told:
Yet, since the Times have been so bad,
Through many Losses we have had,
It Is wasted, therefore I complain,
I never shall see so much again.
Man.
Perhaps you may not, yet never the less,
If God does but our Labors bless,
We may be furnished with content,
Then do not in the least lament.
Love, let not Losses make thee sad;
When Job was stripped of all he had,
His Sorrows he with patience bore,
And grew far richer than before.
He in his Sorrows thus did say,
God gives and likewise takes away,
And blessed be his holy Name,
From whom his greatest Comforts came*
Then let us learn of him, my Dear,
To bear with Faith and Patience here,
The Sorrows which we undergo,
For God is merciful I know.
Then dry thine Eyes and do not weep,
For, while I live, I hope to keep,
With Pains and Care, my Family,
Our eldest Son shall work with me.
Woman.
Well, loving Husband, since I find,
That thou art so ex^^eding kind,
God's Providence I Will not distrust,
For he is merciful and just.
Henceforward, with a cheerful heart,
With thee I Will strive to bear a part;
Thy cheerful Words, like Cordials fin^
Has cured this drooping Soul of mine.
