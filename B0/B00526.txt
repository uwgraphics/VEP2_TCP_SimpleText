The wooing Maid, OR
A fair maid neglected,
Forlorn and rejected,
That would be respected:
Which to have effected,
This general Summon
She sends in common,
Come Tinker, come Broomman,
She will refuse no man.
To the tune of, Is'be the dad ont.




I Am a fair Maid
if my glass do not flatter,
Yet by the effects
I can find no such matter:
For every one else
can have Suitors great plenty,
Most marry at fourteen,
but I am past twenty.
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid,
take me for pity.
I see by experience,
which makes me to wonder,
That many have Sweethearts
at fifteen, and under,
And if they pass sixteen
they think their time wasted,
O what shall become of me,
I am out-casted:
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid,
take me for pity.
I use all the motives
my sex will permit me,
To put men in mind,
that they may not forget me:
Nay sometimes I set
my commission o'th tenters,
Yet let me do what I will
never a man venters.
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid
take me for pity.
When I go to weddings,
or such merry meetings,
I see other maids
how they toy with their sweetings,
But I (...) alone
like an abject forsaken,
Woe's me for a husband
what course shall be taken?
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid
take me for pity.
When others to dancing
are courteously chosen,
I am the last taken
among the half dozen,
And yet among twenty
not one can excel me:
What shall I do in this case,
some good man tell me.
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid
take me for pity.
The second part
To the same tune.




It Is said that one wedding
produces another,
This I have heard told
by my father and mother:
Before one shall escape me,
I Will go without bidding,
O that I could find out
some fortunate wedding.
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O if you lack a maid
take me for pity.
Sure I am unfortunate
of all my kindred,
Else could not my happiness
be so long hindered:
My mother at eighteen
had two sons and a daughter,
And I Am one and twenty,
not worth looking after.
Come gentle, etc.
My sister that is nothing
so handsome as I am,
Had six or seven Suitors,
and she did deny them:
Yet she before sixteen
was luckily married,
O Fates, why are things
so unequally carried?
Come gentle, etc.
My kinswoman Sisly
in all parts misshapen,
Yet she on a husband
by fortune did happen,
Before she was nineteen
years old (at the furthest)
Among all my Lineage
am I the unworthiest.
Come gentle, etc.
There are almost forty
both poorer and younger,
Within few years married,
(yet I must stay longer)
Within four miles compass,
O is it not a wonder,
Scant none above twenty,
some s^^teene, some under.
Come gentle, etc.
I hold my self equal
with most in the parish,
For feature, for parts,
and what chiefly does cherish,
The fire of affection,
which is store of money,
And yet there is no man
will set love upon me.
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O let me not die a maid,
take me for pity.
Who ever he be
that will ease my affliction,
And cast upon me
an auspicious affections
Shall find me tractable
still to content him,
That he of his bargain
shall never repent him.
Come gentle, etc.
I Will neither be given
to scold nor be jealous,
He nere shall want money,
to drink with good fellows*
While he spends abroad,
I at home will be saving,
Now judge, am not I a Less
well worth the having?
Come gentle, etc.
Let none be offended,
nor say I Am uncivil,
For I needs must have one,
be he good or evil:
Nay rather then fail
I Will have a Tinker or Broom-man,
A Peddler, an Inkman,
a Mat man, or some man,
Come gentle, come simple,
come foolish, come witty,
O let me not die a maid,
take me for pity,
M.P.
