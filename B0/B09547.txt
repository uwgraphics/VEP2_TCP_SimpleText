Proceeded so far as to Finish the First Volume, and Prepare much for the

Propose to raise Money by the Sale of Mr. Ogilby's Books in a Standing-Lottery;
which being Opened on the First of May at Jo's Coffee-House, and Drawn by the
22th of May, to the general Satisfaction of the Adventurers. This sudden
Dispatch caused some quantity of the Books to come into the Hands of the said
William Morgan; which, with the Addition of some Bibles, he is encouraged once
more to set to Sale in manner following:

Each Lot is 20 s. and the least Prize is 18 s. which, whosoever Draws single,
and does not like, shall receive 15 s. for it again.

The Number of the Prizes is 798. The Number of Blanks 400. which is Two Prizes
to One Blank.

But considering the Abatements, Additional Lots, and Satisfaction given to
those that Draw Blanks, as is mentioned in the 2d. 3d. and 4^h. Proposal, the
Adventurers will have near two and a half to o^e Blank, and the Prizes of the
Books will certainly advance when this Disposal is over, as has done the
BIBLE, which being sold by Mr. Ogilby for Thirty Shillings, is now raised to
Five Pound Ten Shillings; for that none of these Books, will ever be Printed
again.

The Books will be Delivered as soon as Drawn, at the Office near the
Chancery-Court in Westminster Hall. And the Lots may at any time be sent for
and opened by the Adventurers, and the Prizes delivered upon return of the Lots
to the Office.
