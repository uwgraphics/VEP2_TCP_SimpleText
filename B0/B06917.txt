The Ragman: OR,
A Company that fell at odds one day,
Which of them should carry the Cunny skins away,
They strove who should have it, but none of them wise,
For the Usurer and the Devil carry away the przie.
To the Tune of Upon the highest Mountains, or, The absence of my Mistress




THere was a Ragman and a mad man
As they traveled on a day,
There came a Beggar and a Bagman
And stole the Cunny skins away:
Quoth the mad man
to the Ragman
I have it in my brain,
to make the Beggar
and the Bagman
Bring the Cunny skins again.
Then with a cup of fuddle
The Mad man he did take
The Bagman on the noddle
Till his brains began to ache,
till the Beggar
he did stagger
He had drunk himself so blind:
thus they paid them
till they made them
Leave the Cunny skins behind.
It was a Lock-smith and a Drinker
As they went forth on a day,
They met a Blacksmith and a Tinker
Stole the Cunny skins away?
quoth the Lock-smith
to the Drinker
I will take him over the brain,
I Will make the Blacksmith
and the Tinker
Bring the Cunny skins again.
Thou shall find me as good mettle
The Drinker he did say,
As any is in the Kettle
He beats upon each day:
quoth the Lock-smith
(then the Blacksmith)
Also by me shall find
I Will so fuddle
Vulcans noddle
Till he leave the Cunny skins behind.
There was a Cobbler and a Broome-man
As they did meet one day,
There came a Carman and a Plowman
Stole the Cunny skins away,
quoth the Cobbler
to the Broome-man
W'le so toxicate the brain
we will make the Carman
and the Plowman
Bring the Cunny skins again.
We will call them to a parley,
The Broome-man thus did say,
How they sow their Dates and Barley.
And how they cut their Grass and Hay,
then the Carman
leg and arm man
With Barley broth we will hind,
we will not forsake them
till we make them
Leave the Cunny sknis berhinde.

IT was a Ioyner and a Rope maker
As they went on the way
There came a Brewer and a Baker
Stole the Cunny skins away
quoth the Ioyner
to the Rope maker
It Is in a merry vain.
make the Brewer
and the Baker
Bring the Cunny skins again.
Quoth the Ioyner to the Brewer
Though that malt in price do fall
Yet still he will be sure
For to make his drink too small
the Rope maker
told the Baker
Your knavery we shall find
which if we take you
we shall make you
Leave the Cunny skins behind.
It was a Glover and a Weaver
As they met on the way
There came a Fiddler and a Peddler
Stole the Cunny skins away.
quoth the Glover
to the Weaver
I will take him over the brain
we will make the Fiddler
and the Peddler
Bring the Cunny skins again.
The Weaver with his Treddle
So fast about him laid
Till the Fiddler pulled out's Fiddle
And then a Lesson played
whilst the Glover
with strong liquor
So well their caps had lined
which made the Fiddler
and the Peddler
Leave the Cunny skins (...)
It was a Broaker and a Tailor
As they met on a day
Came the Hangman and the Jailer
Stole the Cunny skins away
quoth the Broker
to the Tailor
we will take them on the brain,
and make the Hangman
and the Jalyor
Bring the Cunny skins again.
Quoth the Broaker, if the Hangman
I chance withal to meet
His sides I will so bang (man)
He shall hardly stand on's feet,
quoth the Tailor
with the Jalyor
No pleasure I can find,
but if we take them
we shall make them
Leave the Cunny skins behind.
It was a Royster and a Revell
As they did meet one day,
Came an Usurer and the Devil
Stole the Cunny skins away:
quoth the Royster
to the Revell
We Will take them on the brain
we will make the Usurer
and the Devil
Bring the Cunny skins again.
The Royster with his Rapier
At the Devil he did run,
And at him he did vapor,
But could not make him shun,
whilst the Revell
he did cavell
Crying out we have foul play
for the Usurer
and the Devil
Bears the Cunny skins away.
FINIS.
