PROCLAMATION For the CONVENTION of ESTATES.
CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Scotland, England, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and sundry Our good Subjects Whom these presents do or may concern,
Greeting.
The great care We have of the honor and safety of that Our ancient Kingdom,
moved Us some months ago to give Order for the raising of such Forces, both
Horse and Foot, as We conceived necessary to prevent a sudden Invasion; And
seeing that just and necessary War in which We are engaged does still continue,
We do think it necessary to keep up these Forces, for the defense of that Our
Kingdom, as long as the present danger from Foreign Enemies remains. Therefore,
to the end, the easiest and most regular way of their maintenance may be agreed
upon, We have thought fit to call a Convention of the Estates of that Our
ancient Kingdom, to meet at Edinburgh upon the ninth day of January next to
come; And do hereby require and command all Archbishops, Dukes, Marquesses,
Earls, Viscounts, Bishops, Lords and Officers of State of that Our Kingdom, to
be present and attend that Diet; And also We do require all Our Sheriffs in the
several Shires and their Deputies, that if there be any new Elections made for
this year of Commissioners to Parliaments or Conventions, they make timous
intimation to those Commissioners to keep this Meeting: but if there be no
Elections already made, that then they forthwith call and conveen all the
Freeholders in the respective Shires, that according to the Laws and Acts of
Parliament, Elections may be made of fit persons to be Commissioners for this
Convention, and that Our Royal Buroughs make choice of Commissioners
accordingly, and that they, and all other persons having interest, attend this
Convention of Our Estates, under the pains contained in Our Laws made
thereanent. And that all Our good Subjects may have notice of this Our Royal
Will and Pleasure, We do hereby command Our Lion King at Arms, and his
Brethren Heralds, Macers, Pursevants and Messengers at Arms, to make timous
Proclamation hereof at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and at the Mercat-crosses
of the head Buroughs in the several Shires of that Our Kingdom.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the twenty fifth of October, one thousand six
hundred and sixty six, and of Our Reign the eighteenth year.
