The Loving Lad, AND, The Coy Less. Or, a new Dialogue between two young
Lovers.
The Youth did love the Girl entirely well,
But she (because her beauty did excel,)
Seemed nice and coy, as Virgins use to be,
And yet at last they both did well agree:
The match was finished but on such condition,
That she might fully know his disposition
Therefore she did injoyne him not to marry,
But for her sake, full seven years space to tarry:
And then she is resolved (to end all strife,)
She Will be his faithful, constant, loving Wife.
To the Tune of, my father gave me House and Land, or, the Young man's joy and
the Maidens happiness.




Man. ALl hail thou bright and bonny Lass,
my joy and only sweeting,
Good Fortune now has Brought to pass,
that we should have a meeting,
That so I might behold thy face
and speak my mind unto thee,
And since here is a sitting place,
I do intend to woo thee.
For I long time have loved thee well,
but yet I never did show it,
Because indeed the truth to tell,
I durst not let thee know it.
For fear thou should my love disdain,
and so in coyness shun me,
And not my person entertain,
which would have quite undone me.
But now I have more courage gained,
and am resolved to try thee,
For my affection is unfeigned,
How can thou then deny me.

Maid. I prithee Will, be soft and sweet,
methinks you are too hasty,
O talk no more of wooing yet
For fear your Master baste ye.
You are as yet a Prentice Will.
then leave such fond adventures
And think not of a wife until,
you have served out your inventures.
For why I think there is no time lost,
but you may longer tarry
Your age is twenty years at most,
a little too young to marry.
Then take my council if you please,
and rest a while contented,
Forbear such rash attempts as these,
which often times are repented,

Man. Indeed I wish I able were,
to follow your direction,
But little do thou know my Dear,
the strength of my affection.
Love burns so hot within my breast,
that if I should conceal it,
Besure 'twould never let me rest,
until I did reveal it,
For where true love the heart does sway,
in any Loyal Lover
He cannot brook one weeks delay,
but must his mind discover.


Therefore sweet loving mistress Jane
consider my condition,
My heart with love is almost slain,
O! prove a kind Physician,

Maid. Fie, fie, thou art a flattering youth,
I do not like thy carriage,
Leave off such toys for in good truth,
they will thee quite disparage,
Think it not strange that I am coy,
or that I have denied thee,
I never will affect a Boy,
what ever does betide me.
Herein I do thee not disgrace,
but speak as't does behove me,
For thou never had a manlike face,
therefore I cannot love thee.

Man. Oh! my Dear that is a killing word,
I prithee henceforth forbear it,
And let thy sweet lips some comfort afford
speak kindly that I may hear it.
I prize thee more than Gold or Pearl,
thou art my only Jewel,
Then prithee do not frown my Girl,
why should thou be so cruel.
It thou continuest to deny,
and thus in scorn to flight me,
Then surely I, for love must dye,
Oh! do not so require me.
But if thou wilt grant me love at last,
and yield thy self unto me,
My grief and sorrows which are past,
us harm at all can do me,
For in thy love I shall rejoice,
even as it will behove me,
And thou shall find (my only choice)
how dearly I do love thee.

Maid. If that indeed your words be true,
and you do so affect me,
Grant this request, and that will show,
how much you do respect me,
Live for my sake a single life,
until seven years a are ended,
And then for to become your wife,
I fully am intended.
But if the same you do refuse,
great cause I have to suspect you,
Another mate you may go choose,
for I will never affect you.

Man. My Dear, this is a difficult task,
and yet I tell thee truly,
Since thou art pleased the same to ask,
I will perform it duly,
Full seven years space, for thy sweet sake
a Bachelor I Will tarry;
And eke all other Maids for sake
with my True-love to marry.
Now give me leave to kiss thy hand,

Maid. my leave is quickly gained,

Man The sweetest Damosel in the Land,
at last I have obtained.

FINIS.
