AEgipt, whom he delivered from death, and how he slew a mighty Dragon. The tune

This thing by art the wise men found
which truly must observed be,
Wherefore throughout the City round,
a Virgin pure of good degree.
Was by the Kings commission still,
Took up to serve the Dragons will.
Thus did the Dragon every day,
a Maiden of the town devour.
Till all the Maids were worn away
and none were left that present hour.
Saving the Kings fair daughter bright,
Her fathers joy and hearts delight.
Then came the Officers to the King
this heavy message to declare,
Which did his heart with sorrow sting,
she is quoth he my Kingdoms heir.
O let us all be poisoned here,
Ere she should dye that is my dear.
Then rose the people presently
and to the King in rage they went,
Who said his daughter dear should dye
the Dragons fury to prevent,
Our daughters all are dead quoth they
And have bin made the Dragons prey.
And by their blood we have been blessed
and thou have sa(...) thy li^e thereby.
And now in justice it does rest,
for us thy daughter so should dye
O save my daughter said the King
And let me feel the Dragons sting,
Then fell fair Sabrine on her knee
and to her father then did say,
O father strive not thus for me,
but let me be the Dragons prey,
It may be for my sake alone,
This plague upon this land was shown.
It Is better I should dye she said,
then all your Subjects perish quite,
Perhaps the Dragon here was laid,
for my offense to work this spite.
And after he has sucked my gore,
Your land shall feel the grief no more
What have thou done my daughter dear
for to deserve this heavy scourge,
It is my fault as may appear,
which makes ye Gods our state to grudge
Then ought I dye to stint the strife,
And to preserve thy happy life.
Like mad men th^^ the people cried
thy death to us can do no good,
Our safety only does abide,
to make thy daughter Dragons food.
Lo here am I and come quoth she,
Therefore do what you will with me.
Nay stay dear daughter quoth the Queen
and as thou art a Virgin bright.
That have for Virtue famous been,
so let me cloth thee all in white.
And crown thy head with flowers sweet,
An Ornament for Virgins meet.
And when she was attired so,
according to her mothers mind,
Unto the stake then did she go.
to which they did this Virgin bind,
Who being bound to stake and thrall,
She bad farewell unto them all.
Farewell dear father then quoth she,
and my sweet mother meek and mild,
Take you no thought nor weep for me,
for you may have another ch^ld.
Here for my Countries good I Will dye,
Which I receive most willingly.
The King and Queen witha^l their train
with weeping eyes went then their way,
And let their daughter there remain
to be the hungry Dragons prey,
But as she did there weeping lie,
Behold St. George came riding by.
And seeing there a Lady bright,
fast tied to the stake that day.
Most like unto a valiant knight,
straight unto her did take his way,
Tell me sweet Maiden then quoth he,
What person thus abused thee.
And lo by Christ his cross I ^ow,
which here is figured on my breast,
I will revenge it on his brow,
and break my lance upon his crest.
And speaking thus whereas he stood,
The Dragon issued out of the wood.
The Lady that did first espy
The Dreadful Dragon coming so
Unto St. George aloud did cry,
and willed him away to go.
Here comes that cursed fiend quoth she
That soon will make an end of me
St. George then looking round about
the fiery Dragon soon espied,
And like a knight of courage stout,
against him he did fiercely ride.
And with such blows he did him greet,
That he fell (...) his horse feet.
FOr with a Lance that was so strong
as he came gaping in his face,
In at his mouth he thrust it long
the which could pierce no other place.
And there within this Ladies view
This Dreadful Dragon then he slew.
The savor of his poisoned breath
could do this Christian knig^t no harm
Thus did he save the Lady from death.
and home he led her by the arm.
Which when Ptolomy did see,
There was great mirth and melody.
When as the famous knight St. George,
had slain the Dragon in the field,
And brought the Lady to the Court
whose sight with joy their hearts filled.
He in the Egyptian Court then staid
Till he most falsely was betrayed.
The Lady Sabrine loved him well
he counted her his only joy.
But when their lov^ was open known
it proved to Georges great annoy.
The Morocco King was in the Court,
Who to the Orchard did resort,
Daily to take the pleasant Air,
for pleasures sake he used to walk,
Under a wall whereas he heard
St. George with Lady Sabrine talk.
Their love he revealed to the King,
Which to St. George great woe did bring.
These kings together did devise,
to make this Christian knight away,
With letters him Ambassador
they straight way sent to Persia.
And wrought to Sophy him to kill,
And tra^^erously his blood to spill.
Thus they for good did him reward
with evil and most subtily,
By much vile means they did devise
to work his death most cruelly.
While he in Persia abode,
He quite destroyed each Idol God.
Which being done he straight was cast
into a Dungeon dark and deep
But when he thought upon his wrong,
he bitterly did wail and weep.
Yet like a knight of courage stout,
Forth of the Dungeon he got out.
And in the night three housekeepers
this valiant knight by power slew,
Although he fasted many a day.
and then away from thence he flew.
On the best steed the Sophy had,
Which when he knew he was full sad.
Then into Christ^ndome he came
and met a Giant by the way,
With whom in combat he did fight,
most valiantly a Summers day,
Who yet for all his bates of steel,
Was forced the sting of death to feel.
From Ch^istendome this valiant knight
then with (...)
Vowing upon those heathen Lands
to work revenge which at the last
Ever thrice three years was gone and spent
He did (...) great (...).
Save only AEgipt land he spared,
for S^brine bright her only sake
And ere his rage he did suppress,
he meant a trial kind to make,
P^olomy did know his strength in field,
And unto him did kindly yield.
Then he the Morocco King did kill
and took fair Sabrine to his wife,
And after that contentedly
with her St. George did lead his life.
Who by the Virtue of her chain,
Did still a Virgin pure remain.
To England then St. George did bring,
this gallant Lady Sabrine bright,
An Enuch also came with him
in whom the Lady did delight.
None but those three from AEgipt came,
Now let me print St. Georges fame.
When they were in the Forest great
the Lady did desire to rest,
And then St George to kill a Deer.
to feed thereon did think it best,
Left Sabrine and the Enuch there,
While he did go and kill a Deer.
The mean time in his absence came,
two hungry Lions fierce and fell,
And tore the Enuch presently
in pieces small the truth to tell.
Down by the Lady then they laid,
Whereby it seems she was a Maid.
But when St. George from hunting came,
and did behold this heavy chance,
Yet for his lovely Virgin pure.
his courage then he did advance.
And came into the Lions sight.
Who ran at him withal their might.
But he being no whit d^^maid,
but like a stout and valiant knight,
Did kill the hungry Lions both
within the Lady Sabrines sight,
But all this while sad and demure.
She stood there like a Virgin pure,
Then when St. George did truly know
this Lady was a Virgin pure,
His doleful thoughts that ere was dumb
began most firmly to renew,
He set her on a paltry steed,
And toward England came with speed
Where he arrived (...) short while,
unto his Fathers dw^lling place,
Where with his dearest love he lived,
when fortune did their Nuptials grace,
They many years of joy did see,
And led their lives at Coventry,
