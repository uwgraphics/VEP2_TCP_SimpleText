THE SWORD OF THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON:

To this is subjoined a Prayer for an Army going to Battle, and a
thanksgiving after the Victory.

By M. Zachary Boyd, preacher of Gods word at Glasgow.

Prove. 21.31. The horse is prepared for the day of Battle, but safety is of
the Lord. Printed at Glasgow by George Anderson, 1643.

UNTO HIS EXCELLENCE MY LORD GENERAL LESLY, EARL OF LEAVEN, etc.
Please your EXCELLENCE.
MOre then fifeteene hundred years ago Christ's beloved Disciple heard a loud
voice, saying in heaven. Woe to the inhabitants of the earth; the reason is
subjoined, Rev. 12.12
for the Devil is come down, having great wrath, because he knows that he
has but a short time; his time is now shorter, therefore his rage is
increased, for this cause has he taken the Antichrist, the man of sin by the
hand, 2 These. 2.3
who with all his followers breath nothing but cruelty.

It is storied of the mother of Dominicus, who after became a great patron of
Monks, that when she wa^ with child of him she dreamed tha^ she had in her
womb a wolf, wit^ a burning torch in his mouth; suc^ indeed be all Babels
beasts that cam^ out of the Antichristian den, t^^ whelps of that great beast
of Rom^ they are all Ravenous wolves, Mat. 7.15
th^^ have nothing in their mind but fi^^ and Gunpowder, to blow up Kin^ and
Parliaments, and if that su^ceed not; to make havoc of all renting the head
from the member even the King from his most faithfu^ Subjects, whom they at
this time (^ being the loyal Catholic Subject^ declare to be but traitors
and r^bels, as if the Fox would make t^^ flock believe, that the shepherds d^
were their great enemy and did d^prive them of many fair Prerog^tives, but if
he were in his place, th^^ should have all according to the Good will and
Pleasure.

This is the maine quarrel of Bri^aine this day; Satan in great wrath with the
forces of Antichrist are in ^he open field; The Lord is going to Battle
against them, and he has ^hosen your Excellence to be his Gide^n; Here is the
Sword, even the Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon; I offer it to your
Excellence, as ^eartily as ever Jonathan gave unto David his Sword and his Bow.
1 Samuel 18.4


My alleagance to my dear Master Christ, necessitates all my endeavoures to
help forward the Good Cause, both by tongue and pen; that man is happy of whom
men may truly say, that which Christ said of the Woman that powered the
ointment on his head, Mark. 14.8
she has done what she could.

This little book, even that which I could, is come to your Excellence to beg a
look of favor; It is not from any presumption of its worth that it durst look
so high; a lower patron might well have served higher meditations; but love
whiles makes folk too forward; it made Mary to striv^ to get Christ in her
arms when i^ was not lawful to touch him. Joh. 20.17


Your Excellence loyalty, courag^ and zeal, still levelling at Gods glory
makes you so dear to all his faithfu^ servants, that glad would we all b^ to
have any thing that might be t^ you for a testimony of our sincer^ affection
toward you, A mite of love is better than a million of complements.

While in modesty I disparag^ this work, as it is from m^ self, yet I can
not in niceness^ altogether deny, but GOD hat^ made my pen to hit upon diver^
things, which may bring profit^ to the Reader: What ever th^^ work be after
it has been both preached, penned, and printed if it be not so precious as
purple and blevv silk, which the riche^ sort did afford at the making of the
Tabernacle, yet let it be but like Goats-haire the poor man's gift, I with a
most willing mind offer it to the Lord, who accepted as well the poor man's
pigeon, as the rich man's ox for a Sacrifice: Lev. 12.8
This being such an offering for GOD, I humbly desire, that by the way it may
get a favorable glance of your Excellence eye, under whose patronage it may
be respected in the going forth by your honorable authorizing, though it come
far short both of your Excellence desert, and of mine own desire; the
treatise is small, but it is an Earnest of more; that little I have, or am, is
most sincerely at your Excellence service, for whom the Urims and Tummims of
Levi in this land, shall daily be presented before the Lord; our altars shall
still reeke with the incense of hearty prayers for your prosperity and
happiness.

While at the Battle of Amaleck, Joshuah fought in the valley, Moses prayed on
the mountain; Exodus 17 11
So while your Excellenc^ Gods Joshuah shall in the valle^ fight for GODS
Israel against Papists, Prelates, and Arminians Satan's black Squadrons, vv^ the
servants of the LORD vvi^^ climb the hill, and hold up ou^ hands by prayers
unto God, s^ that your Excellence may boa^^ Gods enemies, and say unto them as
Abijah threatened the idolate^ of King Jereboams army, 2 Chro. 13 12
Behold God himself is with u^ for our Captain, and his Priest with sounding
Trumpets, to cr^ alarm against you.

Now Christ that great Jehovah the Captain of the Lord host, the God of
Battles, protect you^ person, perfect your graces, prospe^ your vvayes, prolong
your days, direct your army, make you still victorious, comfortable to your
friends, Cant. 6.10
terrible to your foes, as an army with banners, that after ye with honor
have finished your course, 2 Timothy 4.7
and fought the good fight on earth, ye may get glory in heaven with all
these faithful Commanders, these noble vvarriours, these great Generals of
Gods armies, Moses, Joshua, Barak, Gideon, Jephte. Samson, and Samuel, and all
others GODS worthies, whose names are written in the Book of life.

Your Excellence most humble servant, M. Zachary Boyd.
From Glasgovv the 27 of November, 1643.
THE SVVORD OF THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON.
Psalm 60. verse. 11. Give us help from trouble, for vain is the help of man.
12. Through GOD we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down
our enemies.
THat was a worthy speech of S. Augustine, Aug. conf. 6. Deus unicum habet
filium sine peccato, nullum sine flagello.
God has one Son without sin, but none without suffering; The righteous are
only Gods children, and these are the men of many troubles, Psalm. 34.19
many are the troubles of the righteous; Note.
By this means their souls are bleached, Dan. 12.10
and as Daniel says, are tried and made white.

As for the wicked whose best fruits on earth are but stinking hemlocks, Am
6.12 Psalm. 73.5
they both bud and flourish; they are not in trouble like other men, neither
are they plagued like other men; the paltry pleasures of the earth make them to
forget God, their Savior Christ, and the precious soul that lies in their
bosom; Psalm. 73.6
because they prosper, therefore pride compasses them about as a chain;
violence covers them as a garment; Note.
All their joy is without and not within, because they want a good conscience,
the Bird of the Bosom which sings most sweetly in the day of trouble; they are
rocked in security and often live in outward ease, until the end come; then
does the Lord cast them down to destruction; As a dream when one avvaketh he
will despise their image, Psalm. 73.20
that is, their shadows, their transitory estate, the moment of their
fugitive folies and fadding pleasures: He that has been in the Sanctuary, a
Scholar of God, will never envy their prosperity. No, not; let them keep
still their honors, and their rents, and their riches, and their glory, and
all their good things, I leave them in their pestilent path unto him who is the
righteous Lord, who is preparing for them Tophet, a pit, Isa. 30.33
a lake of fire, eternal flames, streams of brimstone and gnashing of teeth;
hell it self is groaning for them.

My chief earand in this psalm, is to seek out wisdom for to teach the
godly what to do in the days of their distress; the text is most fit for this
purpose, it sends you away from men to see^ the help of God, Give us hel^ from
trouble, for vain is the hel^ of man, through GOD we sha^ do valiantly, etc.
These are word most fitting for a Commander when with his troops he marches
to the Battle; THE SWORD OF THE LORD AND OF GIDEON, are the matter of m^ Text.

Of the Title of the Psalm.
BEfore I come to the words, will first illustrate unto yo^ the title or
inscription of the psalm, whereby ye may the be^ter understand the nature, the
occasion and subject of the whole the inscription is in these words* To the
chief Musician upon she shan-eduth, Michtam of David to teach, when he stro^
with Aram Naharaim and with Aram-Zobah, when Joab returned, and smot of Edom
in the valley of salt, twelve thousand.

1. Shushan.
BY Shushan here some understand a six stringed instrument, upon which the
chief Musician was ordained to play the praises of God, contained in this
psalm; we have the like title prefixed to the forty five psalm, To the
chief Musician upon Shoshannim, that is, a six stringed instrument so called
from the Hebrew word Shesh, which signifies six; (...)
others not without good reason think that this psalm be so called, for its
beauty, because it is pleasant and of a good savor, like a Lilly, who for
its six leaves is in the Canticles called Shoshan, Cant. 2.1
I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lilly of the Valleys; Dearly Beloved, this
day have brought for yo^^ comfort this most pleasant Lill^^ from the Garden of
God.

2. Eduth.
SEcondly it is called Eduth, th^^ is, the testimony, this declaret^ the
Psalm to be a testimony o^ David's faith in the day of troubl^ wherein both
through God, an^ for God he did most valiantly or it may be called Eduth, the
test^monie, because it was ordaine^ to be sung by the Priests before the Arc,
Exodus 40.5
which was called Aron-Eduth the Arc of the test^monie, because it was a
Testimony or witness of Gods present among his people.

3. Michtam of David to teach.
THirdly, the Psalm is calle^ Michtam of David to teac^ that is a golden
Psalm, full of ^olden doctrine, to teach chiefly ^en of war on whom to re^^y
in a day of Battle. The He^rew word Michtam is from that other word Cethem,
(...)
which signi^ieth most fine gold; the Spouse ^n her Song gives this word to
Christ's head; My beloved, said ^he, is white and rudy, Cant. 5 10
the fairest among ten thousand; his head is Cethem as the most fine gold.
Massa auri vel auram obrizum.
Such ^s this Psalm well in the margent ^f your Bibles called a Golden Psalm:
there be great riches; I ^ring unto you this rich propine from God, a most
excellent trea^ure, and offer it unto you this day; The thieves, the men of
war may steel or spoil you of your Gold, as the Danites did to Mi^ah when
they bereaved him of his Silver-images, Judge. 18.18
but if ye get this gold, ye shall live and die rich, ^n despite of all the
world.

I think that there was Silver and Gold in great abundance i^ Laodicea, whose
words were s^ rich, Rev. 3.17
I have need of nothing but because that Church had ver^ little of this Gold,
Christ Jesus proclaimed her a beggar, mis^rable and poor.

If ye consider this most fin^ gold, this land of all lands is the most rich in
Gold mines; there (...) no such plenty of Gods word under the cope of heaven,
as by h^ favor we have this day; Go^ word is our gold; for this gol^ we must
all be ready to lay dow^ our lives: Rev. 3.11
It was Gods counse^ to Philadelphia, Hold fast the which thou have, that no
man ta^^ thy crown; let us do so with the gold of GODS word; let n^ man take it
from us.

This gold is better then an^ gold of the earth; the earth gol^ is both dumb
and dead, it can sa^ nothing for the comfort of it^ owner, in the terrors of
death, but this gold is a teacher; it is here called Michtam of David for to
teach: This is not the gold of Papists idols Elilim, teachers of vanities. So
called from Elil, (...) Lev. 26.1
that is nothing, these golden nothings with their golden beards, have mouths
and speak not, eyes and see not, ears and hear not; Behold a great plague,
these that make them are like unto them; Psalm. 135.18
so is every one that trusts in them, or makes any religious use of them; It
is no wonder that Papists can not easily be drawn from their idolatry; the
reason is this, there is a fearful curse upon them, they are by GOD in his
wrath stupefied and made deaf like their golden idols; Blessed be the Lord, our
Bibles are Michtams jewels of gold, for to teach souls what to do in such
terrible days, as are these wherein we live; therein we have comforts both in
life an^ death.

4. When he strove with Aram Naharaim and with Aram-Zobah, when Joab returned,
and smote of Edom in the valley of salt, twelv^ thousand,
THe occasion and Subject o^ this Psalm, were many enemies Syrians and
Edomites gathered in Battle against David wh^ fought against them, and by the
power of GOD overcame them*

The enemies who were Syrian^ are here called Aram Naharai^ and Aram-Zobah; the
Syrian^ are called Aramites from Aram the Son of Shem, the Son Noah* Shem had
Elam, and Ashur, and Aram, and Arphaxad; the Assyrians came of Ashur, and the
Syrians of Aram, Genesis 10.22
and the Israelite^ came of Arphaxad, for Arphaxad begat Salah, and Salah begat
Heber, from whom GODS people were first called Hebrews, after from Ja^obs
wrestling were called Israelits, And last of all from Judah the son of Jacob,
were called Jews: The and of Aram, which was Siria, ^ad many parts, as Padan
aram, Genesis 28.2 1 Chro. 19 6 Genesis 24.10
and Aram Maacah, and Aram of ^amascus; here we have Aram ^aharaim so called
from the He^rew word Nahar, that is a flood, (...)
because it did lie between the two ^^vers Tigris and Euphrates; for his cause
by the Greeks it was ^alled Mesopotamia, that is the and between the rivers,
here also made mention of Aram-Zobah, which was a country near the ^ther;
unto these were joined E^om, the posterity of Esau, who ^as called Edom, that
is red, because ^hen he was borne, he came out ^ed all over like a hairie
mantle; Genesis 25.25
^hese Edomites joined with the other Syrians, came against Dav^^ in hope to
have Canaan, which as they esteemed, belonged b^ better right unto the
posterity (...) Esau, who was the elder b^^ther; mention here is only ma^^ of
twelve thousand Edomites ki^led; the rest of the history is (...) down at
large in the eigh^ chapter of the second boo^ of Samuel.

The place where this batt^^ was foughten is called the val^^ of Salt, a place
as some thin^ near unto the lake Asphalti^^ where Sodom and Gomorah we^
before their destruction, a^ where Lots wife was turned i^ a pillar of Salt:
Genesis 19.26 Genesis 14.3
In Genesis, t^ valley is called the valley of S^dim, which is the salt Sea, a
pla^^ by God, in a manner sown w^ salt, and made barren by Go^ curse, Psalm.
107.34
who when he is angry p^teth a fruitful land to Saltne^ that is to
barrenness, Deuteronomy. 29.23
for Salt causes barrenness.

The division of the Psalm.
THe parts of this Psalm are chiefly three; In the first part, David
complains of GODS hard dealing with his people; O GOD, says he, thou have
cast us off thou have scattered us, thou have been displeased, etc. Of this
until the fourth verse: In the second part from the fourth verse until the
ninth, he comfort himself in GOD, Thou have given a banner to them that fear
thee, etc. In the third part from the ninth verse until the end, he powers
out wishes and prayers for help in his troubles, and at last ends the Psalm
with a most courageous resolution, to fight for the glory of God, and for the
liberties of the Kingdom^ Through God we shall do valiant^^ This Psalm is most
fit for a d^ of Battle, the Lord teach me t^ day with Habakkuk to say, Hab. 2.1
I^ stand upon my watch, and set me u^ the tower, and will watch to see w^ God
will say unto me.

The division of the Text.
IN the words of the text, the be two chief parts; In t^ first part we have
David's pra^er, Give us help from troub^^ for vain is the help of man; the
second part we have Davi^ courageous resolution, Throu^^ God we shall do
valiantly; (...) he it is that shall tread do^ our enemies.

I. PART: David's Prayer.
THe Prayer of David here is contained in these words, Give us help from
trouble, for vain is the help of man.

In this prayer we have two things; first, a petition; secondly, the reason;
the petition is in these words, Give us help from trouble; the reason is
subjoined in these words, for vain is the help of man.

1. The Petition. Give us help from trouble.
THe help he seeks from God is, that God would help him from trouble.

The troubles of this world are of two sorts, the troubles of the wicked and of
the godly; As for the wicked, they for a time have their good things here;
Luke 16.25
during this time they are strong and stu^dy, they are so brawned and sear^^
and sealed up with senselessness o^ Gods wrath, that they seem only happy; If
at any time the^^ conscience begin to grumble, mu^ter, or make a noise, they
ano^ drown the voice with earth^^ sounds, like the Israelites drumm in their
Sacrifices to Moloc^ which hindered them to he^^ the pitiful squeels of their
children burning in the fire of Tophe^ They all have an eating wor^ in their
Conscience, Mark. 9.44
which the feed with earthly comforts a^ men feed with raw flesh, the wol^ or
feaster in the arms or legs but oh, when the days of the ease is expired,
and these raw fles^ly comforts removed, there be n^ troubles like their
troubles, which are filled with such strong, an^ strange ingredients of
fears, an^ Bedlam fits, that they (like A^pen leaves) tremble at their own
shadow; Hell is already within them; when they begin to be thus gnawed with the
worm that dies not, they are so tared and tortured, that they imagine hell on
earth to be worse then hell below; Note.
Thus desperate Francis Spira said often, That he envied Cain Saul and Judas,
wishing rather any of their rooms in the dungeon of the damned, then to have
his poor heart so rent in pieces with raging terrors, and fiery desperations
upon the bed of death.

Whereupon he at another time being asked, if he feared more torments after
this life; Yes, said he, But I desire nothing more then to be in that place,
where I shall expect no more.

These and such are the troubles of the wicked below, when their sleeping worm
is wakened; the^ are such, that they imagine tha^ their troubles in hell shall
give ease unto their tortures on earth* for this reason diverse do desperately
either hang themselves or throw themselves down from high precipices: as for
the troubles of the godly, whereof I have to speak chiefly in this place,
they are very many and painful, though ever mixed with mercy.

The troubles of Gods servants here below are of two sorts, either inward or
outward: The godly inwardlv will be horribly hemmed in with sorrows; and sore
vexed with dreadful desertions, having their wounded hearts all bleeding,
under the lashes of the Law, Mic. 6.7
so that they would give their firstborn for their transgression; the very
grief of hell will lay hold on their souls; in a manner with their Master
Christ they will descend into hell; but after many painful wrestlings, they
having received a Certificate of mercy, at last, by his Spirit, they
victoriously ascend into heaven, and so triumph over all their troubles.

As for their outward troubles here below, the Church on earth is like a ship
on the sea tossed to and fro, with winds and waves; of this, our pure Church of
Scotland, has woeful experience this day: Our whole land is now in trouble;
many godly hearts are pricked with great perplexity; our watchmen all cry,
Zeph. 1.14
The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hastes greatly, even the
voice of the day of the Lord; verse. 15.
a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wastnesse and
desolation, a day of darkness and gloominesse, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, Zeph. 2.2^
the decree is in readiness to bring forth; a fearful tempest is fast comeing
with horrible gale; Inimicorum malitia est nostra militia.
the whole land (...) like to be turned into a bale a fi^^ and therefore our
Nation at thi^ hour, has great need to cry t^ God in the words of this tex^
Give us help from trouble.

The time of trouble, the sa^ and irksome hour, is the tim^ of prayer: we have
both precep^ and prastise, and also promises o^ deliverance to these who at
su^^ times give themselves to prayer*

The precepts are both in the old Testament and new: In the old Testament, God
says, C^ upon me in the day of trouble; Psalm. 50.15
the new Testament, God sait^ Is any among you afflicted? (...) him pray. Iam.
5.13


As we have the precepts, also it has ever been the pract^ of all Gods
children to pray their troubles; Hos. 12.4
Jacob in his tro^ble weept and made supplication Moses prayed so that God in a
manner entreated him, Exodus 32.10
to let him ^lone, as though the power of the man's prayers had overcome his
omnipotency, from doing his people Jsrael any hurt; Est quaedam precum
omnipotentia.
Luther was wont to say, There is a certain omnipotency in prayer, it has an
^ternitie of virtue; all the godly in all times have known this, and therefore
when great troubles ^ame, their practice was to power out many prayers; when
the Amalekites did fight against Israel, Moses went up to the mount and prayed
for Israel* Jonah in the belly of hell prayed, Exodus 17.11 Joh. 2.2.
out of the belly of hell, said he, cried I, and thou heardst my voice; when
Christ was in his agony in the garden, he most fervently prayed again and
again; all the psalms of David's troubles are most excellent prayers. Mat.
26.42


As we have both precepts and practice for praying in trouble, also have we
most fair promis^ to be heard; Psalm. 50.15
Call upon me in (...) day of trouble says the Lord, a^ I will deliver thee;
In the ne^ Testament we have Christ cr^ing, Mat. 7.7
Ask and ye shall receiv^ seek and ye shall find; the pr^mise is made to
all, as well to the beggar on the dung hill as the Prince sitting on his Throne.

Here is a King begging from God; the thing that he seeks, help from
trouble; that which m^ved him to cry for help was h^ trouble, and this was his
chief^ trouble, that his enemies in gr^ number had this often in the mouth,
that God netheir would^ could help him; Many there said David, Psalm. 3.2
that say of my so^ there is no help for him in GO^ David's dangers never troub^
him so much as Gods dishono^ when Gods glory seemed a^ way in jeopardie, that
was David's ^^ouble; My tears, said he, Psalm. 42.3
have ^ene my meat day and night; while ^hey continually say unto me, where thy
God. this chiefly made David ^eer to cry for help, give help, Lord, from
trouble.

Observe here that these who ^re truly godly, The Doctrine.
find no trouble ^o sensible as that which is by the ^ishonour of God: Eli was
a ^ood man, though he had his own ^ults in a too great indulgence ^owards his
children, yet in this ^ee manifested an honest heart, that nothing troubled him
so much as the dishonor of GOD: When the messenger came from that Battle,
wherein the Israelites were overthrown by the Phili^^ines, and told him many
evil news, ^e sat still in his chair, and heard ^im; when the messenger said,
^srael is fled before the Philistines, 1 Samuel 4.17
^e sat still, though with a grieved heart; after that the m^senger said,
There has been (...) a great slaughter among the peop^^ these news wounded
him so^ yet he sat still in his seat; af^ that the messenger said, A^ thy two
sons Hophni and Phi^has are dead; this heard, man a very great wound in his
hea^ yet he sat still in his seat; b^ as soon as the messenger h^ said, The
Ark of God is tak^ Eli could sit no longer, 1 Samuel 4.18
but from off the seat backward, by seat of the gate, and his n^ brake, and he
died.

The 1 use; Seeing this o^ is a day of trouble, The 1 use
and of t^ sort of trouble, that the Arc God is in danger to be taken the
Philistines, let all men the have a Christian heart, cry mig^tily with their
heart, Give (...) help from trouble; The Lord complained of his people, that
the cried not unto him with their heart, Hos. 7.14
^hen they howled upon their beds; ^e all now have great need to ^y unto God*
with our hearts, or if our day go down, and if ^ur Gospel, the glory depart
^om our land, we shall say that ^e never knew what trouble was ^ntill now: what
a sorrow shall (...) be to us to hear that Israel is ^d before their enemies?
what a ^rief to hear that there has also ^ene a great slaughter among the
^^ople? what a piercing of heart, (...) hear that Hophni and Phineas, ^ur
sons or our husbands are ^^aine or dead: But O who shall ^e able either to
stand or sit, if ^hese news shall come, the Arc ^f god is taken? the Gospel
of jesus Christ is in the hands of Gods enemies, for to be taken ^^om us? these
shall be the black^st news that ever were heard in ^ur land, since the
beginning of our reformation; then may (...) godly men and women (...) with
the dying wife of Phine^^ Ichabod, 1 Samuel 4 21
where is the glory? the shall be a trouble indeed; a^ therefore before it
come, let us with vvounded and bleedi^^ hearts cry mightily to God Give us
help from trouble.

If we do this duty diligen^ I dare promise in the Name (...) the Lord, that
all these who r^fuse this day to set up altars to that shameful thing, Jer.
11.13
shall last see a hand work such a gl^rious work in this land, that t^^ world
shall know, that our GO^ is the Lord; many nations sh^^ cry as the Israelites
did (wh^^ God brought down fire upon E^^jahs sacrifice) The Lord, he is t^^
God, 1 King. 19 39
the Lord he is the God; b^ otherwise, if we be negligent vicious, if the Lord
has ca^ to say, Amo. 2.4
For three transgressio^^ and for four, if we by our sins continue to press
our God under (...), as a cart full of sheaves, Am. 2.13
it ^ay be that he will suffer his ^rk, his Gospel to be taken pri^^ner, and
set it in the Temple ^f their idols, but at last (after that the Lord has
corrected his people, for the contempt of his Gospel) he shall do with all
Po^ish idols, as he did with the ^hilistines Dagon, which first he made to fall
upon his face to the ^^ound, 1 Samuel 5.3
and after they had set ^im up again, cut off his head, and ^he palms of his
hands, verse. 4
only the ^mp of Dagon was left to him; after that where ever Gods Ark
^emained prisoner, the Lord smot ^is enemies on the hinder parts ^ith Emrods;
they had no rest ^ntill they sent it back again; ^^us the Lord most gloriously
^elped his people from trouble. If we will continue in sincerity, to fast and
pray, there shall (...) be a stone in the field, but shall be like that stone
of Sam^el, which he called Eben-ezer, t^ stone of help; in whatsoe^^^ danger we
shall be, we shall (...) with Samuel, 1 Samuel 7 12 Am. 4.1
Hitherto has (...) Lord helped us; hear this word ye^ of Bashan, who push
with yo^^ horns against Gods dear s^^vants, as though God did (...) regard, or
could not give us from trouble.

The 2 use
The 2. use. Let this serve reproof to these base and bea^ bodies, whose names
are wri^^^ in the earth, Jer. 17.13
who have neit^^^ heart nor hand nor tongue, for help Gods Church from trouble,
th^^ have not a thought of pity, th^^ know not what it is to be g^ved for the
affliction of Jose^^ they have made their hearts an Adament-stone, Amo. 6.6.
they are (...) and beastly, Zach. 7.12
they have no courage in their hearts; they have ^o hands for the good cause;
their tongue by their words, as ^y a Sibboleth, bewrays them, Jud. 12.6
^at they are not on Gods side; (...) send such to hearken Deborah (...) her
song, cursing bitterly all those that come not to help the lord, Jud. 5.23
to help the Lord against the mighty;

If Meroz was cursed because ^hey came not to help the Lord, ^ll the curses of
Ebal shall, like fire and brimstone, rain down upon ^ll these, who for a
short glance ^f proseritie, for a vain hope of preferment, for a vanity of
^anities, for a golden dream, ^ome against the Lord, for to ^urt the good
cause; a cloud of wrath, a world of woe, a hell upon earth, shall one day come
upon all these, who rejoyceing ^n the Churches desolations, say, ^th, so would
we have it; Psalm. 35.25
such shall either perish by fire wi^^ that company of Corah, or swallowed up
with Dathan, shall die by the sword with ^laam, or shall burn themselv^^ with
Zimri, or shall hang the^ selves with Judas and Ahitoph^ the Lord shall set
wicked n^ over them; Psalm. 109.6 7.8. etc.
Satan shall stand their right hand; when they sh^^^ be judged, they shall be
condemned, their prayers shall be tur^^^ into sin, their days shall few, and
another shall take the office; their children shall be ^^therlesse, and their
wives widow^ their children shall be vagabo^^ and beg: the extortioners shall
ca^ all that they have, etc. In a vvo^^ their possessions shall be made t^
breeding of nettles, and a perpet^^^ desolation; Zach. 2.9
all the imprecatio^ that David made in that Psal^ against his enemies, shall
come upon these that refuse to help t^ LORD, and his Church from trouble.

The word trouble here is in the Hebrew, Tsar, (...)
which signifies straitness or distress as when a man is so driven into
some narrow place, that he knovveth not to what hand to turn him. When God
being angry at King David, for numbering the people ordained his Prophet Gad,
not in a smooth and silken Court-sermon, but in a divine authority, to give
the King his choice of seven years famine, or of three months flying before
the enemies, or of three days pestilence, David the King said unto the
Prophet, 2 Samuel 24 14
I am in a great strait; in the Hebrew it is Tsar-li; as if he had said, (...)
I am besiedged on all sides, I know not to what hand to turn me, I doubt of
what plague to make choice.

Observe here, The Doctrine.
what is often the condition of Gods dearest children, their life here is
full of troublesome turnings; their condition of life is to be driven into
great straits; this was the complaint of the Church, They have often afflicted
me from my youth, Psalm. 129.1
and again immediately after, they have often afflicted me from my youth; the
door of heaven is called the strait gate, and the way thereunto is called
the narrow way: Mat. 7.13
Satan's rage is restless, his trade is a trade of blood, he is that old
spevving dragon, who casts out of his mouth floods of venime after the Church;
Rev. 12.15
what is Christ's Church on earth, but like a scorched heath, or a root in dry
ground? All these that now sing in heaven have mourned here; before they came
to these mansions of joy, they all past thorovv the valley of Baca, a world of
tears and troubles; S. John in the Revelation, says, that one of the Elders
of heaven came unto him, and said, Rev. 7.13
What are these that arc arraide in white robes? men all filled with joy; S.
John could not tell what kind of men they were; Sir said he, thou know;
then the Elder said to John, these are they which came out of great
tribulation; verse. 14
there be no souls in heaven now, but first on earth they have been in great
tribulations; they in great terrors and anxietie have all cried, Give us help
from trouble, in the day of their small things they all have been in a great
strait. Zach. 4.10


The 1. use; The 1 use
Let us all here learn, that in this world many swarms of sorrows, and
vexations are prepared for us that mind the way to heaven; the best hearts
below are often crammed with sighs, and groans; the grief of mind consumes
their marrow, chills their blood, wastes their spirits, shortneth their life,
makes them pale and wanne; that we should not startle, in our fears Christ
has foretold and said, Joh. 16 33
In the world ye shall have tribulation; Again, the world shall laugh, Joh.
16.20
but you shall vveep: the devil, the Prince of this world, Joh. 12.31
still goes about to fasten his fangs upon redeemed souls, and to spite fire
bals at the faces of best Christians; the church by Zachary, is compared to
myrtle trees in a bottom, Zach. 1.8
or low valley, that is in a low base and contemptible condition; here is not
our rest, and therefore let us not think among so many dogged Doegs, cursed
Curres, to come to heaven, but by a way that is strait, narrow, and
troublesome, a way of deepest sighs and saltest groans, a way strovved with
losses and crosses; Satan can not forget his trade of tempting, and of spewing
floods of troubles against the Saints; the word of God tells us, that he has
fearful depths, Rev. 2.24 2 Cor. 2.11
crafty devices and strange plotted wiles to bring a mischief upon all these
that truly fear God; (...) Ephesians. 6.11
If we live godly in Christ let us resolve to suffer persecution, to sail
through seas of sorrows: yea, to be in the belly of hell like Jonah, where
troubles like waters shall compass us about, even to the soul; Joh. 2.5
as long as the Devil is out of hell, he will not cease to devise pestilent
plots against all these that walk toward heaven: By the Cross Christ himself
went to the Crown; will we be able to find another way? are we dearer to God,
then David was? Hear him here crying to God, Give us help from trouble; Jacob
that Prince of God, Genesis 32.28
an Israel, who by wrestlng overcame God, Genesis 47.9
walked also in the way of troubles; few and evil said he, Gen 47.9
have my days been; Daniel, Dan. 10.19
a man greatly beloved, wa^ cast into a den of Lions, after a great vision he
fainted, and wa^ sick many days; Dan. 8.27
Christ himself is called a man of many sorrovves, he suffered hunger, Isa. 53.3
thirst, nakedness, and at last, was put to death like a Traitor, attached on
a rack After him came a world of hi^ worthies, of whom the work was not worthy,
of whom (lik^ others before him) some were tortured, and others had trial o^
cruel mockings, Heb. 11 35
and scourgings, o^ bonds, and imprisonments; of other it is said, that they
were stoned and savven asunder, verse. 36
and slai^ with the Svvord, and that the vvandred about in sheep skins and
goat skins, being destitute afflicted, verse. 37.
tormented; As it hat^ been, so it shall be with God servants on earth, until
tbe lo^ day of mankind come to its even: seeing it is so, let all of us now in
these days of trouble resolve with Ezekiel, Eek. 12 18
to eat our bread with quakeing, and drink our drink with trembling, because
we have sinned; if the Lord send a persecution, let us purpose, yea resolve to
cast off our most costly apparel, to forsake all other delights, for to go
with Christ, having the sheep-skinnes or goate-skinnes upon our backs: heb.
11 37
let us be content in our days of trial for Christ, to put on Joshuahs
filthy garments, Zach. 3.3
the vilest rags of captivity: We have enjoyed a long rest, a most
vvonderfull peace; we know not but by hearing, or reading, what the Cross
is; now in all appearance the time is come, that the Lord will let it be seen
who are his true servants: it may be that he permit now such a cruel trial,
the like whereof has not be^ in our land, and therefore it is o^ duty in
this day of our publi^ fast, to entreat the Lord most earnestly for one of
two, that eith^^ (according to the words of m^ text) he would give us help from
trouble, in delivering us rom the great evils we fear, or else tha h^ would
give us strength, patience and courage to suffer for his sake yea, to rejoice
with the Apostle that we are counted worthy to suffer either shame or pain for
hi^ name: Act. 5.41
Outward torments for Christ are nothing to these wh^ have a good conscience,
tha^ heavenly musician singing mo^ sweetly day and night: One sait^ very well,
that the tears of good conscience have more pleasure in them, then the world
greatest joy; they are full of the sweetest juice, marrow, hone^ kernel,
comforts, relish th^^ the heart of man can conceive; Cum suspiriis
inenarrabilibus conjunctu^ est gaudium ineffabile.
they have an unspeakable joy with inuterable sighs.

The 2. use. The 2 use Judge. 7.16
Let this serve for reproof to many, who have not a mind to suffer any thing
for Christ, yea, not so much as to bear a pitcher for Israel, or to cry, THE
SWORD OF THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON.

As long as Christ will give loaves to such, they will most frequently swarm
about him, Joh. 6.26
they are like Ephraim; a cake not turned half daugh and half backed, Hos. 7.8
neither raw nor roasted, Rev. 3.15
lukewarm ^ike Loadicea; Alas many thousands were ready to sit down with
Christ, and to eat of his multiplied loaves and fishes, but where were all
these at Golgotha, when the Lord like a Thief was ^anged up between two
thieves? Yea, where then was Peter himself? where then was Andrew, Peter's
brother? yea, where the^ were James and Philip, and Barth^lomew, Thomas and
Matthew and James the son of Alpheus where were Lebeus, and Simon the
Cananite? S. Mark says that they all forsook him and fled only John
tarried with him a^ the cross, Mark. 14 50
to whom he recommended his mother; Ioh. 19.27
what the^ did, it was through infirmitie^ they all loved Christ dearly but the
fear of death overcam^ their love, this was a great fault; but many among us,
carnal men, soaked in sensualitie^ who have cursedly feared the^^ own
conscience with the hot iron in the Devils forge, me^ whose eyes are darkened
wit^ the mists of hell, have no courage for GODS worship; the Tavern is their
Temple, their bell is their bible and their god; the^ are men of rotten hearts,
whi^^ have so embraced in their arms earthly doung with Demas, 2 Timothy 4.10
that they care not for Religion; such have no courage for the truth, they have
no purpose to suffer loss of lands or lives, 1 Cor. 1.18 Ezekiel. 28.3
for the folly of this Gospel: Behold they are wiser then Daniel: They esteem
all these but fools, that in the torrents of troubles forsake their fair
clothes and houses to put on the goat skins, Heb. 11.37
and to abide in the caves and dens of the earth; such wise worldlings cannot
imagine that Christ is on the suffering side; while they rest pleasantly in
their beds of yvory and of ease; Am. 6.4
they in their hearts scorn at men as fools, that quite their lands and their
lives, their wives, and their houses, and their wealth, for to suffer trouble
for religion, which (fie, fie,) they imagine to be but opinions of men, conceits,
devices of giddie brains; Giv^ unto such the black Mass, an^ all the idols of
Rome; yea, the Turkish Alcoran, under some other more honest names, and they
shall embrace them all, before they quite their sieled houses and their silks,
Hag. 1.4
for to put on the sheep-skinnes, for to wander up an^ down with the faithful
servant^ of Jesus Christ: Heb. 11.37
while these fools, have a hot gleame o^ earthly glory, while the sails o^
their sensuality are filled with carnal delights, they are at home yea (as
they think) in heaven crowned with rose buds, and garlands of glory? while
they thu^ tumble in these earthly pleasures though the Lord Jesus promis^ unto
them the Crowns of hi^ Kingdom, they are (though i^ another sense) like the
Olive-tre^ that would not quite its fatness and like the fig tree, Judge. 9.9
that would not quite its sweetness; or like the Vine, that would not leave
its wine for to be made Kings over the trees: if such temporisers keep fast
their earthly good things, Luke 16.25
their cursed bags with holes, they care not for crowns in heaven; Hag. 1.9
their earthly ease is To sweet, that they purpose not to pass through the
pikes, for to have need of this prayer, Give us help from trouble; what ever
side is strongest, they mind to laugh with these, like our swallows who
forsake us in winter, In terras apricas.
for to fly most swiftly un^o lands warmed with a hoter Sun; If our ship go
well before the wind, they will sail with us; they will make up a navy, and
go in company; but as soon as they find the wind blow another way, they
follow the blast, and set their sails according to the weather, being fully
resolved never to run hazard so, but that they may ever have one foot loose;
the fear of troubles so nettles their nature, which is of such a cowardly
constitution, that they can not want their ease: Let such know, that by the
doom of divine wisdom, a great woe is denunced against all their ease and
pleasures, which shall soon come to an end; whethe^ they be Nobles, or
Churchmen, or Gentlemen, or of the Common sort, that will not quite their ease
for to follow Christ with a Cross, at the hour of death they shall all find
that they have been but fools; After that these Nobles, or Gentlemen, have in
their worldly pleasures scoured the plains with their horses and the fields
and woods wit^ their hounds, and the heavens wit^ their hawks, and have
enjoye^ here what their hearts could wish, the short gleame of their glory
shall pass in a moment; ^hen death shall cry to these fools soaked in ease and
vanity, Alight from your horses, and go to the dungeons of stink; As for
Church men, who are cowards behind, whereas they should be Captains before,
like the seven Priests with their seven trumpets, Josh. 6.4
for to encourage the men of war to fight Gods battles, they shall be greatly
disappointed like a poor man in a golden dream, or a hungry man at a feast
in his sleep; behold when they are wakened, there is nothing but poverty and
emptiness: Of all that sort of whatsoever rank they be that are not zealous
for God, truly may be said, they are lovers of pleasures more then of God; 2 Timothy 3.4
they may have ^ome form of godliness, but ^eeing they deny the power
thereof, the Apostles counsel is, that we turn away from such; le^ them be,
until their day com^ when GOD shall let loose the cords of their conscience,
upon their bed of death, so that in manner they shall be strangle with the
horrors of hell, an^ damned above the ground worms, scorpions, fear, fire*
furies, wormwood, and gall shall be the last portion of these fearful, Rev.
21.8
who have no courag^ for the truth, while it is i^ any danger.

2. The reason. For vain is the help of man.
WE have heard of the petition, Give us help from trouble; now let us hear
hi^ reason, it is in these words, for vain is the help of man, as if he had
said to God, O Lord we depend upon thine help alone, and not upon the strength
of our army, which without thee is but a vain thing: David had learned this
when he fought against armed Goliath, having nothing but a scrip and a sling; If
David had not known that an armed man had been a vain thing, he durst never
have looked Goliath in the face; It is written, that when the Israelites army
saw the man, 1 Samuel 17 24
they fled from him, and were sore afraid, verse. 25
and the men of Israel said one to another, Have ye seen this man that is come
up? as if they had said, we never saw such a man as this; But David who had the
Lord with him, cared not for him, for he saw him but a vain man, and that all
the help that he could make for the Philistines, should be nothing but a vain
help, for (a^ is here said) vain is the hel^ of man: whether man's help b^ for
us or against us, this remains sure and true, Vain i^ the help of man: the
Hebrew word (Shave) signifies a lie, (...)
rash, false, vain, idle, of n^ virtue, or worth.

Observe here what are these most mighty armies that men can make either for to
help us, The doctrine.
or to hurt us; they are but men; the Scriptures say, What is man? He is but
flesh, Psalm. 8.4
and all flesh is grass, 1 Pet. 1.24
what are his bones the^ pillars and master timber of his tabernacle? how
easily are they broken and bruised into powder* I (said Hezekiah) reckoned till
morning, Isa. 38.13
that, as a Lion, so will he break all my bones; the most valiant Captains,
the bravest soldiers, (if the Lords strength sinew not their arms and legs
are all but a deceiving lie: (...)
a lie ^ntill it be known seems to be some thing, whether it be to ^ejoice us
or to affright us, but (as soon as it is known) either ^he joy or the fear it
brought unto us, perish away like smoke; If we see a great army for us, if
Gods help be not with us, men's help will be but a lie, even a staff of a
broken reed, Isa. 36.6
whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand and pierce it: Men without
God have neither hearts nor hands to fight; Behold, (said Nahum) thy people in
the midst of thee are women, that is, Nah. 3.13
fearful and faint hearted bodies: when Israel went out with their army
against the Philistines, having the Ark of God with them, they thought that
the victory was certain, and therefore they all shouted with a great shout,
so that the earth rang again; 1 Samuel 4.5
but because God was not at the battle with them, all their co^rage and force
was found to b^ but a lie; All the Captains o^ Israel were that day like the
great grassehoppers, Nah. 3.17
which camp in the hedges in the cold day; but when the Sun arises, they
flee away and the place is not known where they are: likewise on Gilboa^ where
Saul and Jonathan were slain in the Battle, all the captains that day were
found to be but a lie; How, 2 Samuel 1.25
said David are the mighty fallen in the midst o^ the battle? When Israel wen^
to battle against the Benjamites* for the quarrel of the Levites concubine
that ruefull spectacle, they understood not this part of my text, vain is the
help of man* they knew not that man's strength and courage was but a lie, and
therefore relying upon the strength of men, they resolved to bring to the
battle against Benjamin the tenth man of the land; we, Jud. 20.10
said they, will take men of an hundred, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, so their
army came to the number, of four hundred thousand tbat drew Sword: All these
came against the Benjamites, who were but six and twenty thousand and seven
hundred, but Israel found, that vain was the help of man; for in the first day
of the Battle, they lost twenty and two thousand, in the next day they lost
eighteen thousand; until the Lord by fasting and prayer was moved to help
them, they found the truth of my text, that vain is the help of man.

As man without God is vain in his help, so if he come against God, he is
more vain in his hurt; God called King Belsh^zar that enemy of his Church
Tekel a man of no weight or wort^ Behold with what a pomp Ki^^ Pharaoh
gathered the horses a^ charets of Egypt, Dan* 5.27 (...)
for to bri^^ back Gods people to their bondage; He, as is said of Ki^^
Agrippa, Act. 25.23
and Bernice his Queen came (...) with great fantasy, pomp or fool^ vain
show; I said he, will pu^sue, Ezod. 15.9
I will overtake, I will divi^^ the spoil, my lust shall be satisf^ upon them;
I will draw my swor^ my hand shall destroy them; the^ were King Pharaohs big
bra^ while his army put on the harn^ but God did blow with his win^ and the sea
covered them; verse. 10.
they she as lead in the mighty water he had to do with one strong then
himself: Senacherib f^ this when God put his hook^ his nose, 2 King. 19 28
and his bridle in his h^ though his army was like the sand of the sea shore
for number, he was not able to hurt Gods people; the Papists could not
prevail against this land neither by fire nor water; by water they came by
open force, by fire they came like black devils under the earth, hid in vauts,
but blessed be the Lord, both the one and the other was a lie, rash, false,
vain, of no virtue; not a hurt but a help to teach our Kings and the Nation,
not to suffer the bloody hounds of that profession, to abide any more in our
bosom.

The use; The use.
Seeing that men without God, either in their help or hurt are but vain, a
lie, false, of no virtue, let us beware, either to trust too much in the forces
of men that are for us, or yet in a cooled courage, to be too afraid for the
forces of men that are against us: God was very vvr^^ with David for
numbering t^ people; they were thirteen hundred thousand valiant men, 2 Samuel
24 9
b^ because David caused numb^ them, as if the help of man h^ not been vain,
the LORD* three days killed by the pest^lence threescore and ten thousa^^ let
us beware to count our for^^ our forts, and our friends, o^ Colonels, our
Captains and o^ Canons; all these things are b^ vain things; they, for to
stri^ them on the right vein, are b^ as is in my text, a lie; If t^ Lords help
be not for us, thoug^ our men were like Saul and Jon^than, 2 Samuel 1 23
swifter then Eagles, a^ stronger then Lions, the fearf^^ day of Gilboah, a
black saturn^ shall come upon us; nothing sha^ be heard but groans and
lame^tations, How are the mighty f^^len, 2 Samuel 1 27
and the weapons of war p^rished! the Lord for our sins, shall deliver us
into the hands of bru^ish men that are skillful to de^troy. Ezekiel. 21 31


But if we can be truly humbled; if every one will turn from their evil
ways, and go to God in sincerity with fasting and prayer, for to seek GODS
help, whose charets are charets of salvation, Hab. 3.8
we shall not need to fear ^he forces of men; these who have eyes to see Gods
charets of fire round about his Church, 2 King. 6 17
as ^hey were about Elishah, may ^corne all the forces of Princes; It is for
blind Gehazis, when they see great armies of men to tremble and say, 2 King. 6
15 Exodus 14 13.
Alas master what shall we do? If we can stand still with Moses, we shall see
the salvation of the Lord, we shall sing and rejoice; when Moses saw King
Pharaoh and all his bravest Captains gasping in that gulf of the sea, wherein
they were drown like dogs, he tuned up hi^ song, Exodus 15 3.
The Lord is a man of warr^ God save our King, the anointe^ of the Lord; the
lap of his ga^ment shall never be cut by us but if Gods enemies, these R^mish
and Arminian troops, wi^ still like the Egyptians pursu^ Gods Church in this
land, for t^ speak in Pharaohs words, Exodus 15 19
to satisf^ their lust upon us, let us stand sti^ upon our most holy faith, and
w^ shall see the salvation of the Lord Scotland shall sing the song o^ Moses,
The Lord is a man o^ war; Exodus 15.3
if his help come to the Battle, we shall not need t^ fly with Israel, or in
great fear say, of a most mighty armi^ as the Israelites trembling, said of
Goliath, 1 Samuel 17 25
Have ye seen the man, or this army that i^ come up?

2. PART. David's courageous resolution.
IN the first part of this text, we have heard of David's prayer for Gods help,
which was backed with a reason taken from the vanity of man's help, in these
words, for vain is the help of man.

In this second part we have David's courageous resolution, through God, says
he, we shall do valiantly; for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

In these words we have two things, first, David's courageous resolution before
the battle, through God we shall do valiantly; Secondly, he declares the
ground of all his courage, for, he it is that shall tread down our enemies.

1. David's courageous resolution.
THe courage of David he (as ye may see) was very great: when the armies of
Aram Naharaim, and of Aram Zobah were ready to go to battle against David,
David encouraged Joa^ the Captain, and the whol^ army with these words,
through God we shall do valiantly.

(...)
The Hebrew word Chaijl signifies valor, force, power* prowess, activitie,
and courag^ both of body and mind; In this sense David took it, when he said,
Psalm. 18.32
God girdeth me with valor; the word also signifies an army, Psalm. 33.16
because in armies courageous men use to be, whose hearts are steeled with
stoutnesse.

David the servant of God here (though in a very great danger) was all full of
courage, Through God, said he, we shall do valiantly; with his courage he was
both godly and wise; he was god^y, for he relied not upon his own valor, nor
yet upon the ^ourage and skill of Joab his cap^aine, nor yet upon the strength
of his army, but upon GOD, whom king Nebuchadnezzar cal^ed a LORD of Kings;
Dan. 2.47
this Lord of Kings was King David's GOD, through whom he would do valiantly.

As he was godly in his cou^age, so also he was wise, for as through God he
hoped to pre^aile, so also he would do some^hing himself; he went not to ^he
other extremity, as to say, All is well now, the Lord will be unto us a wall
and a sconce, and therefore we need not trouble our selves any more, we may all
sleep now and take our rest, for God will do all; no not David himself, would
also do^ something for to help the Lord through God, said he, we sha^^ do
valiantly; that Prophet sai^^ wisely to the King of Israel, 1 King. 20 22
g^ and strengthen thy self, and mar^ and see what thou do; Go^ himself
said to Zion, Zeph. 3.16
Let (...) thine hands be slack.

The use.
The use; Let us all this d^ learn of David so to depend upon God, that we
neglect not t^ do something our selves; If the Lord has a Sword, Jud. 7.18
let Gide^^ have another; THE SWORD O^ THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON the neglect of
the means is tempting of God; when Christ was by Satan set upon the pinac^^ of
the Temple, Mat. 4.5
he would not ca^ himself down from thence a^ Satan's desire, for needlessly to
tr^ Gods power in his preservatio^ but used the means in commin^ down by the
staire: God will never help these who are careless to help themselves; I
confess, God has no need of our help; though a mighty army like that of the
Syrians which filled the country should come against us, gathered like two
little flocks of Kiddes, 1 King. 20 27
the Lord should not have need to say to us, as Joab said to Abishai, 2 Samuel 10
11
If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shall help me, but if the
children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then will I come and help thee; the
Lord has no need of any man's help against all the armies of men, though all
the world were in Battle array against him and his Church; what are all the
strongest armies of the world, but shadows and bubles like these which little
boys out of spittle and soap in their pastimes, blow up with their quils,
which anon, being but wind within water burst of themselves? what rea^ help
can such brettle things mak^ to the Lord? though men neithe^ can properly help
God, neithe^ has he properly need of any man's help, yet he declares these
cursed with Meros, who in the fearful dangers of Gods church do not their
endeavor to hel^ the Lord, Judge. 5.33
to help the Lord against the mighty.

In such days of distress, le^ all men go to work; let the young men in
Abners language arise to play, 2 Samuel 2 14.
and let the old me^ in Gods language, arise to pray If young Joshuahs fight in
the valleys, Number. 17.9
let old Moses pray on the mountains; though God be^ sufficiently able to do
all, yet the faithful man must do through God; through God, said Davi^ here,
we shall do valiantly; le^ these who can not do through God, lie still like
drones, let them eat, drink, lie, and sleep still, like Epicures, but these
who do through God, shall not fail to do valiantly.

In the word valiantly here I observe that the servants of God, who do
through God, The doctrine.
are the only men of courage, men qualified for valor; the reason is,
because, what they do, they do it through God, that is by Gods help, and for
Gods glory; only such are men of valor; this was a part of Balaams prophecy,
Number. 24 18
and Israel shall do valiantly; David speaking of his enemies said, I did beat
them small as the dust before the wind; Psalm. 18.4
I did cast them out as dirt of the streets; it is the Lord that gives the
heart; only Gods servants have true courage; the wicked, not excepting the
stoutest, are called the Fearful; Rev. 21.8
such sometimes may seem to be valiant, but all their courage is but rage;
lik^ wild Bulls or Boares, or lik^ mad dogs, they may while^ furiously
fight, but he has only courage who is assured to enter heaven after death;
there be many Colonels and Captains who will go boldly to an assault, but if
they fear not God, they are but mad men; Only these are valiant, who can
truly say in the faith and fear of God with David, Through God we shall do
valiantly; what true courage can a wicked man have to die, that incontinent,
after his death is to go from the earth, unto the hells unto the devil and
his angles?

The use.
The use; Before we go to war against men, let us first make war against
our sins; let us by repentance* kill all our Minion delights, and Captain
sins that they reign no more in our mortal bodies, Let us all now in these
days of war so study the practice of piety, that all our doings may be
through God that is both directed by him and for him, that is by his power and
for his glory: If this we do sincerely under Christ's banner, our courage
shall never fail; we in greatest dangers shall be like Saul and Jonathan
swifter then Eagles, 2 Samuel 1.23
and stronger then Lions; in the valley of the shadow of death, we shall not
fear any evil: yea tbough the earth be removed; Psalm. 46.2
and though the mountains were carried into the midst of the sea, we shall
remain steadfast, like mount Zion; if we have God with us in his favor, we
shall not tremble in trouble; no not; Dan. 3.18
with Shadrach we shall boldly face a fiery furnace, Dan. 6.16
and with Daniel we shall not fear the Lions den, what has made so many
martyrs poor simple bodies, in the worlds language precise fools, so
courageously to affront and outface the most fearful frownings of cruel
tyrants, yea, with the wings of faith to out-soare the hight of all human
miseries? what enabled them to suffer most horrible torments, which Captains
were not able to abide? the reason was this, they walked with GOD, and their
doings were through God and for GOD, and therefore through God, they both did
and suffered valiantly; Zach. 10.5
they, said Zachary, shall fight, because the Lord is with them: that was a
brave speech of Luther, Note.
Since I am sent for, I am resolved, and certainly determined to enter worms in
the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, yea though I knew there were as many devils
to resist me, as there are tiles to cover the houses in worms.

Now it is time in this time of trial fast coming, to amend our life, to be
sure of Gods love, to be sure of heaven after this life, that when it shall
come, either to do or die for the good cause, we may through GOD either do or
die most valiantly: let Zedekiahs, 1 King. 22 11
false Prophets with their horns of iron, stout in peace, be Magor missabibs
trembling, Jer. 20.3
fearful cowards in trouble; in the days of danger let them go from chamber
to chamber, 1 King. 22 25
to hide themselves like Rats and Mice; but let all the faithful servants of
God, who have Christ for their Captain; lift up their faces in times of
trouble, saying with the prophet David here, through God we shall do
valiantly; he that fears God needs not to fear any thing; Psalm. 23.4
though he be in th valley of the shadow of death he is still under a most
su^^sconce, Psalm. 91.1
even the shaddovv of t^ Almighty, who ever has a eye on every hair of his
hea^ I exhort you all to think st^ upon this, and to do as Dan^ did, Dan. 7.28
who kept the matter in (...) heart.

2. The ground of David's courage.
NOw in end it follows that we consider the mai^ ground of David's great
courag it was all from the Lords doing for he it is that shall tread down
enemies; neither hole nor hillo^ nor rock, shall be able to hi^ or shelter them.

Here is a Prophecy reveal unto David by him, Dan. 8.16
who betwe^ the banks of Vlai, declared t^ vision unto Daniel; it is a
prophecy of victory from God, of whom it is said here, for he it is that
shall tread down our enemies; David says not here, I and my captain Joab
with the great forces of mine army, shall tread down our enemies; 1 King. 22
11 Mich. 4.13
he says not we shall push them down with horns of iron, or we shall thresh
them with hooves of brass; he braggeth not of his shields glittering with
brightness, Nah. 2.4.
nor of his mighty charets of war, which seem like torches when they whirle
with such fury, Nah. 3.2
that the fire sparketh out of their wheels; the praunsing horses, and the
jumping charets are not his confidence; no not; what ever good befall, he will
not sacrifice unto his own net, Hab. 1.16
nor yet burn incense unto his own dragge, but in great wisdom makes the
Lord the doer of all; He, says he, it is that shall tread down our enemies,
Behold ho^ David here ends this Psal^ of war, by giving all the glo^ of the
victory unto God. vv^ by his infinite power drive asunder the Nations, Hab. 3.6
and scatte^^eth the everlasting mountain and bovveth the perpetual hill The
Prophet Zachary speaki^ of Christ, the man among the myrtle trees says, that
he sa^ him as a man riding upon a r^ horse; Zach. 1.8
by that red fiery color, (...) did imply his readiness to be r^^venged upon
the enemies of h^ Church; when he goes again them, upon this red horse, (...)
does to them as Jehu did to J^^sabel; 2 King. 9 33.
he will not honor the with his hands, by overthrow^ing them by the least
finger (...) his omnipotent power, but ri^^eth over them as on horsebac^ and
tradeth them under foot, lik^ dirt or mortar, he crusheth the by, the hooves of
his wrath, which being sore pressed down, ^ent the hardest rocks into pieces,
and grind the greatest moun^aines into powder; He it is, says David here,
that shall tread down our enemies; thus he ends ^he psalm by giving all
the glory of the victory unto God. The Doctrine.


Observe here, that it is the Lord who is the Lord of hosts, and ^he God of
battles, on whose side is ever the victory; Psalm. 62.1
God has spoken ^nce, twice have I heard it, that power belongs unto God;
though Gideon carry a Sword to the Battle, it is the Lord that treads down:
The Prophet Zachary speaking of that glorious reformation of Gods Church in
the days of Zerubabel, said, Zach. 4.6
not by might, not by power but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts; it is
so that David here speaks in time of war, not by Swords, not by Spears,
not by Captains, not by Horses, but it is the Lord that shall tread down our
enemies it is the Lord that treads dow^ the forces of men, that come a^gainst
his Church; what army can stand before him, who mad that little stone in
Daniel, Dan. 2.34
to grind to dust and powder the four mo^narchies of the world? Let me seek
all their advantage, both o^ time and place against his peo^ple, if his people
trust in him the Lord shall still overthrow their enemies; After that the
Isra^elites by the power of God ha^ tread down the Syrians on the mountains,
the Syrians said their gods are gods of the moun^taines, 1 King. 20 23
therefore they were stronger then we, but let us fight against them in the
plain, and surely we shall be stronger then they; surely they lied; for that
same, God that tread them down on the mountains, overthrew them also in the
plain; Israel that day was before the Syrians, but like two litte flocks of
Kiddes, Jer. 23.23
but the Lord who is a God at hand, and a God a far off, made these Kiddes in
the valleys, to run over the horses of these who said, that all his power was
only upon the mountains; for in the seventh day the battle being joined, the
children of Israel slew of the Syrians, a hundred thousand footmen in one day;
the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and there a wall fell upon twenty and
seven thousand; Behold how neither hills nor valleys, can be able to defend
these who are against the LORD, Zach. 4.7
who can make a great mountain to become a plain: the old walls of cities and
of houses, the wild beasts of the mountains, yea; the very stones of the
field are all in Covenant against these who are against the Lord, and his
Church: Who can stand before that mighy One, before whom all the Nations are
but as the drop of a bucket, or the the small dust of a balance? Hi^ presence
melts the mountains, hi^ voice tears the rocks, at his re^buke the greatest
hills, the pil^lars of Heaven do shake; no ar^mour is at the proof of his
thun^ders; the blast of his breath dis^covers the channels of waters: i^ is He
that makes the Judge fools, Job. 12.17
verse. 21
that pours contempt upon Princes, and weakeneth the strengt^ of the Mighty:
When his wrath is kindled, his arrows drink blood, his sword devoureth flesh
the fire of his wrath burns t^ the bottom of Hell; Deu. 32 22
the Heaven is his span, the Sea his handful the wings of the wind his walk
his garments are light, his pavi^lion is darkness, his way is in the
whirle-winde, Nah. 1.3
the clouds are the dust of his feet; How easy is it to him, Nah. 12.10
in whose hand is the breath of all mankind, to tread down the greatest
Monarchs, who are all but worms and grasshoppers under the clouds, Nah. 1.3
the Dust of his Feet. By all this it is most evident that God is the God of
Battles, the Lord of Armies; None can be able to resist him, the Defender of
his Church, of whom it is here said, For he it is that shall tread down our
enemies.

The use; The use.
Let all our men of war learn here, to depend upon the Lord, and not to go
to battle, without the Lord; they must all say to the Lord, as Barak said to
Deborah, Jud. 4.8
If thou will go with me, then will I go, but if thou will not go with me,
then I will not go; a Captain were he never so courageous, can do nothing
without the Lord: an army of Samsons without God will not prevail; it was not
the cutting of Samsons hair that weakened him; no not; it is said of him,
Judge. 16.20
that he knew not that the spirit of the LORD was departed from him; when that
spirit of the Lord, departs from men, men have neither heart nor hand, to do
valiantly; they flee like sheep before their enemies; 2 Chronicles. 18.16 Josh. 7.11
Israel has sinned, and they also have transgressed my covenant etc, verse. 12
Therefore they could not stand before their enemies, said the Lord to Joshua
mourning for that shameful flight of Israel, from before the men of Ai; It is
only the Lord that gives courage to men: the Lord said, Psalm. 144.1
David teaches my hands to war, and my fingers to fight; only the men that
come from his fence-schoole will be men in the day of Battle; he could make
the lappers of water the smallest of the host of Israel, to do valiantly;
Judge. 7.13
a barley cake from his hand was sufficient to overturne all the might of
Midian; ^he horse, says Solomon, Prove. 21.31
is prepared for the day of battle; but safety is of the LORD; all victories
depend upon him: If we remain still in his favor, and keep his Covenant,
though Senacherib should arise from the dead, and cover the whole land with his
men, in number like the sand of the sea, though an army from Rome or Spain,
with all the English Papists and Arminians, like an army of Caldeans, Habak.
1.6
a bitter and hasty Nation, should march through the breadth of our land, to
possess the dwellings that are not theirs, Habak. 1.8
though they should come with horses swifter then Leopards, and more fierce
then the evening wolves, yea and flee as the Eagle that hastes to eat: in a
word, though we seem to our enemies but grasshoppers, or creeping things that
have no ruler over them, Hab. 1.14
if we abide steadfastly in Gods Covenant, the truth of my text shall not lie,
He it is that shall tread down our enemies he shall make them in their
faires^ greenesse, Joh. 4.7
to wither away lik^ a Kikajon or gourd; some fearful destruction shall teach
these, tha^ tread in their paths, to tremble a^ their end.

Well then seeing it is the Lord and he only, that treads down our enemies,
so that all depend wholly upon him, let us by al^ means beware to offend him,
le^ us take good heed that we look not to the numbers of out men, as Israel
did, Jud. 20.10
when with four hundred thousand men, they fough^ against the Benjamites, let
us learn of their loss in all humility, to begin with fasting and prayer; let
us take good heed that there be not among us an Achan, Jos. 7.18
that made Israel to flee from before the men of Ai, let us seek out all our
sins, as carefully as Joshuah sought out Achan, as curiously as the people of
Godsought out the leaven, and let us cast them away; Deu. 16.4
Moses said to Israel at the Passover, There shall not be seen with thee any
leaven in all thy coast, So the Lord says to you all this day, let not your
sins, your pride, your covetousness, Hab. 2.6
for thick clay, your riot, your drunkenesse, your uncleanesse, your
chambering, your charmeing, your railing, your backbiting, your malice, your
envy, your treachery, Mic. 6.10
and the scant measure which is abominable, and all other such scandalous
sins whatsoever, let them no more be seen among you, Ephesians. 5.3.
This is the Apostles counsel, but fornication and uncleanness, or
covetousness, let it not be once named among you as becomes Saints; If ye
would have God to be with you in the day of danger, Ezekiel. 21.6
sigh now with the breaking of your loins and with bitterness, because the
Lord is angry with our nation, and therefore, loath your selves in your own
sight for your iniquities; Eze. 36.31
let not your old sins abide any more in your company, let them no more be
named among you, woe to the pot whose scumme is in it now. Ezekiel. 24.6


Dearly beloved, strive now to redeem the time; Ephesians. 5.16
Ye may all see that the days are evil, and therefore I exhort you to keep
GODS charge, Zach. 3.7
and walk circumspectly, not as fools; Let every man turn from his evil
ways; Be like a people that has made a Covenant with their God, like a
people with whom God has made a Covenant of life and peace. Mal. 2.5


If we break our Covenant with God, Note.
which we have so solemnly sworn, we shall be more fearfully plagued then that
King Vladislaus, who by the instigation of the Pope brake the League of a
concluded Peace with Amurah the Turkish Emperor, he swearing upon the
Evangelists, and the the other by his Ambassadors, upon their Turkish Alcaron;
when the Turk saw the Battle joined, and remembered the Christians perfidie,
in breaking their Covenant with him, he plucked the writing out of his bosom,
wherein the League was written, and holding it up in his hand, with his eyes
cast up to Heaven, said after this manner, Behold, thou crucified Christ, Hist.
of the Turks, page 297.
this is the League thy Christians in thy Name made with me, which they have
without cause violated, now if thou be a God, as they say thou art, and as we
dream, revenge the wrong now done unto thy name and me, and show thy power
upon thy perjured people, who in their deeds deny thee their God.

In that bloody battle of Varna as the history records, Certatum est totos
dies, noctesqu^tres, diu fortuna ancipiti, sed tanto animorum ardore utrinque,
tantoque impetu, ut caesorum san^guine campi stagnarem.

That is, the space of three days and three nights this bloody bat^tell
continued, so that the field where it was foughten was turned into a poole of
blood.

If such shame and calamities befell the Christians, for breaking their League
with an Infidel, wha^ worlds of misery shall come upon this Nation, if we
(like the dog returning to his vomit) break the Covenant which we have so
solemnly made with our GOD? 1 Pet. 2.22
Doubtless all the miseries that ever came upon a Nation shall have their
Rendevous here; famine, pestilence and war shall not fail to revenge the
quarrel of Gods Covenant: By famine God shall make these who are now like
Nazarites, whiter than milk, Lam. 4.7
to become dry like a stick, and blacker than a coal; by pestilence we shall
fall down in heaps; by war we shall be abolished; like Jabin in Endor our
bodies shall become doung on the Earth; Psalm. 83.9
Our Land shall be an Aceldama, a field of blood, a land of bloody pooles.

And therefore, O Scotland, if thou would henceforth be under a mighty
Ministry, a Goshen for God, a land of life of light, and liberty, free of all
the damned mists of the doctrines of Devils, if thou would be free of a Service
Book, Romes yoke, and of all the Ceremonial Clouts of that varnished Whore,
if thou would have God as it is in my text, t^ tread down all thine enemies,
for sake not the Covenant of thy Go^ break never thy league made wi^ him, have
no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but walk as Children of
light, Ab^horre all idolatry, Mic. 6.16
the statut^ of Omri, and return to the anc^^ent paths, Jer. 18.15
let the Lord no more have a controversy with the inha^bitants of the land;
Hos 4.1
then shall y^ see that the Lord shall work great work in this land; Habak. 3.2
accordin^ to Habakkuks prayer, he sha^ revive the work in the midst of t^
years; Our nation shall find that GODS mercy is not dead though our armies
in the eyes o^ our enemies, 1 King. 20 27 Judge. 7.5 Amo. 5.15
seem but like litt^ flocks of Kiddes, or weak lik^ Gideons lappers of
waters, if ou^ ways please the Lord, the Lord shall be gracious unto the
remnan^ of Joseph; One of these shall come to pass.

Either which we desire most, Israel and Judah, Eze. 37.17
who were joined one to another into one stick, being no more divided in
profession, which Oh that we might register in the catologue of his favors.

Or if not so, the LORD shall change the minds of our enemies as he did to
Esau, Genesis 33.4
and shall make them that come against us to embrace us, as brethren of one
Isle, though not in Religion.

Or if not so, the Lord by some 1 Samuel 23 27.
as he turned Saul from David, by sending the Philistines against the land.

Or if not so, he shall make them fight one against another, as he did to the
Midianites, whose bodies were all gore blood, by mutual wounds.

in the Name o^ our God will set up our Banners The Lord being with us, Psalm.
20.5

soldiers shall not say, 2 Samuel 1 23

the Lord himself shall b^ Scotlands great General, he sha^ give us help from

5.25. Act. 7.43
the star of their god Remphan, their gods of stock and stone, with all their
gods baken in the Oven; Hos. 4.7
the LORD shall change their glory into shame; the world shall hear it and
shall wonder.

But as for us, the children of his Covenant, if we be not unstable as water,
Genesis 49.4
but steadfast in that Covenant, if we abide in the bond of love, like
Scilurus arrows in a sheafe, the Lord shall bless us, our Gospel shall
flourish, our land shall be fruitful and blossom as the rose, Isa. 35.1
our church shall be most orient and glorious, ^ike a hill of pearls, a
Cristall mountain, or a rock of Daimonds; then shall our hearts be filled with
joy, and our mouths with laughter; Moses and Miriam, both men and women, shall
most sweetly sing these words of triumph, Exodus 15.3
The LORD is a man of war, who has set his triumphing foot upon the neck of
a^ his enemies, as upon his va^^quished vassals.

1 Timothy 1.17
Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise GOD, be
honor and glory for ever, and ever, AMEN.

A SERMON FOR A BATTLE:
Psalm. 17.13. Arise O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down; deliver my soul from
the wicked with thy Sword.
THE Prophet David made this Psalm, in the days of his great troubles, while
he was hunted, 1 Samuel 26 20. 1 Samuel 23 14.
from place to place, like a partridge or a flea; his danger was great in
Keilah, from Keilah he fled unto the wilderness of Ziph, verse 14
where being discovered by the Ziphites, he fled unto the wilderness of Maon,
where he abode on a rock; there also David made haste to get away, for fear of
Saul; for Saul and his men there had compassed David and his men round about to
take them; behold how man's wrath runs like wilde-fire, but even while David's
life was in his hand, there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, haste thee and
come; for the Philistines have invaded the land; wherefore Saul returned from
pursueing after David for which cause that place was called Selah Hammahlekoth,
1 Samuel 23 28
that is, the rock of division; because there the Lord did separate Saul from
David; these dangers were the occasion of the composing of this Psalm, wherein
David most earnestly seeks Gods assistance against the price, craft, and
cruelty, of his enemies: David in this psalm is like the Nightingale which
sings most sweetly, though she have a thorn against her breast.

The division of the Psalm.
THe parts of the Psalm are three; In the first part from the beginning,
until the tenth verse, the royal Prophet David in confidence of his
integrity, craveth defense of God against all his enemies; In the second part,
from the tenth verse, until the thirtenth, he declares their pride, craft,
and cruelty, comparing them to Lions, greedy of their prey; In the third part,
from the thirteenth verse, until the end, he prays against them with great
confidence in God.

The division of the text.
IN this text (which is a prayer of David to God against his persecuters) there
be two parts; In the first part, we have him to whom the prayer i^ directed, it
is the Lord, Arise O Lord etc. In the second part we have the petitions of his
prayer, which are four in number. 1. Arise. 2. Disappoint him. 3. Cast him
down; 4. Deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy Sword; Let us now come
to the gloss and interpretation of every part of the text.

I. PART. To whom the Prophet here makes his Prayer.
HE to whom the Prophet here makes his prayer, is the Lord, Arise, O Lord.

Observe here the wisdom of David; when he is in distress, The doctrine.
he goes to the right hand, even directly to the Lord; As for Abraham he knew
him not, and therefore he spoke not a word to Abraham, to Jsaac, or Jacob,
Psalm. 73.25
in any of his troubles: whom have I in heaven but thee? was his saying unto
God.

The 1. use; The 1 use.
Let us learn here in whom to trust at all times; it is in the LORD; All other
things whatsoever will fail, but the Lord fails never; Some helpers fail in
will; though they may, they will not; and some fail in power, though they
will, they may not, but the Lord is sure on all sides; there is nothing that
may do us good, but God is able to do it; look how able he is in power, he
is as willing for our well; If we want any thing that we desire, it is either
because we ask it not, Jam. 4.3
or because we ask amiss, that we may consume it upon our lusts, or because
what we ask, is not expedient for us; we often seek from God, and weep for
things which we would have, as children, weep for knives, which their parents
will not give unto them, because they would be hurtful unto them: Many of Gods
children have crying desires for wheat, Psalm. 4.6
wine, and oil, this worlds wealth and ease, but God knows that many would be
hurt thereby, and therefore grants not unto them their desires; The Lord forbid
that God had suffered us to get our hearts desire at all times; the best of us
had been in hell ere now, if God had given us all our will; a years peace or
plenty, O what a change makes it among a people! O how hurtful is it to the
souls of many, who ( crammed with hypocrisy) can crake of piety, and soulder
their graceless doings with great ostentation.

The 2. use; The 2 use.
Let this serve for reproof to Papists, who all slabbered in the dirt of man's
inventions most foolishly, distrusting GODS good will, Jon. 2.8
forsake their own mercy; in steed of crying to the LORD, they court the
L^dy Mary, which is their Queen of heaven, Isa. 44.7
they also run from God to the Saints, as though they had a greater regard unto
us, or loved us better then God; If we had done the thousand parts of the
wrongs to them that we have done unto God, though they had been our fathers,
and our mothers, they had all cursed us, Genesis 9.25
as Noah did to Cham; Cham, so far as I can read, had but once scorned his
father, and for that once his father cursed him, but we have ten thousand
times scorned God, and yet he has blessed us, and blesses us still; His ways
are not our ways, Isa. 55 8
and his thoughts are not our thoughts, for as far as the heavens are above
the earth, as far are his ways above our ways, and his thoughts above our
thoughts, so it is of his mercy and love; Isa 49.15
though a mother forget her child, the Lord can not forget his children; thus
they who go to others then to God are deceived; as if men not content with the
light of the Sun, would go to seek light from the Moon, who has all her
light from the Sun; Of all such God may well say, as he said in the days of
Jeremiah, Jer. 2.27
they have turned the back and not the face; Jonah marketh such with this black
blot, Jonah 2.8
These that observe lying vanities, forsake their own mercy; It was not so
great a wonder under the law to see men idolaters, Cant. 2.9
bcause then Christ but looked out at a window, and showed himself through a
lattesse darkly, but O now in his Gospel he come out at doors clear^ with,
Behold me, Behold me: ^ for us, let our refuge in all di^esses be to God, and
Christ his Son, John 17.3
this is life eternal said Christ in his prayer; only Christ is Mediator,
only by him our prayers are heard; many Pagans did excel in moral things,
but because they knew not Christ, they could not find the door of heaven;
this made a father to say of that great Philosopher Aristotle, August. Vae tibi
Aristoteles, laudaris ubi non es, and damnaris ubi es.
Woe to thee, O Aristotle, who art commended where thou art not, and condemned
where thou art

The second Part. The Prayer.
WE have heard unto whom the Prophet here makes his prayer, it is unto the
Lord now let us consider the prayer i^ self; Arise, disappoint him, ca^ him
down, deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword; I^ this prayer there
be four petitions, 1. Arise 2 Disappoin^ him. 3. Cast him down. 4. Deliver my
soul from the wicked wit^ thy sword; Angustiati animi suspiria.
one calls well these four petitions, the groans of soul in a great strait.

The first Petition. Arise.
THe first thing that the Psalmist here requires of the Lord, is that he would
Arise, and make him ready for his help, Arise O LORD.

When God for causes known to himself, delays his help, he seems to his
servants, to be like a man lying or sleeping; Hence are all these forms of
speeches of the godly, Arise, Psalm. 3.7
O Lord, save me; Psalm. 10.1
why stand thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thy self in times of
trouble? Again, Arise O Lord, Psalm. 10.12
O God lift up thine hand; forget not the humble; Again, Awake, Psalm. 44.23
why sleep thou, O Lord? Arise, cast us not off for ever: again, verse. 26
Arise, for our help, for thy mercies sake, the Scriptures are full of Arise,
and awake, which distressed men cry unto God, while he delays to help them.

The doctrine.
Observe here first, that Go^ comes not ever at the first un^to his servants in
their afflictions he will have them to taste, ye^ whiles to drink of the bitter
cup before he let it pass from them that afterward they may the better taste
and see how good (...) the LORD, Psalm. 34.8
when he has delivered them; Cum differt auxilium videtur Deus sedere otiosus.
Isa. 26.16
God sometime will seem to his servants very careless of their misery, as i^
he were a man lain down to sleep; but all that is to stir up the hearts of
his servants, to cry the more mightily unto him and also to let them see their
own weakness of faith, and how that without him they can do nothing; for
these ends Christ would sleep in the ship in time of tempest, Mat. 8.25
when all was in greatest danger to perish.

The use; The use.
If when we are in calamity either private or pub^icke, the Lord seem to
delay his help and to neglect us, let us not despare of his mercy, but let us
cry the more earnestly, help O Lord; though he seem to our weak judgment to
be sleeping, he is not like Baal, of whom (by way of scorn) Elijah said to his
Priests crying a loud to him in their prayers, 1 King. 18 27
Cry a loud; for he is a God, either he is talken or he is pursueing, or he is
in a journey, or peradventure he sleeps, and must be awaked; our GOD sleeps
not; he that keeps Israel will not slumber; Psalm. 121.3
he never lies down, he is never wearied in waiting upon us, for to do us
good, there is no need of a drum, of five hour bell, to waken him in the
morning.

Again whereas the servant of God here in his fear cries to the Lord, Arise,
I observ^ that there is weakness in the best of Gods servants; they often in
their troubles have bas^ thoughts of God; it is a very base thing to think
that Go^ is wearied; or that he is lye^ down to rest him, or that h^ has not
will to arise, until w^ rouse him up by our cries: Se^ we not these great
bodies of the heavens turned about both nigh^ and day, with an unspeakabl^
swiftness? it is Gods arm tha^ turns them all about: the great body of the
earth has no other ground-stone, but his Almighty power; what I pray you has
still so constantly borne up that great mass, these so many thousand years?
only Gods arm, and yet he is not wearied; he seeks not our help to turn
about these heavenly wheels, or to ease him under the burden of the whole
earth: it is but a very base thought to think that the Lord is lain down to
rest him, that afterward he may arise.

The use; The use.
Let us learn to have great thoughts of God, concerning his power and good
will: What is unpossible to him who is able to make a Camel to pass through a
needles eye? Mark. 10 25
what will he not do for us, who gave his own Son to the death for us? when
we pray, we may be sure that he will hear; To him we may well say, LORD thou
can, if thou will, nay Lord, thou both can and wilt, if it be for thy glory and
our well, if we think otherwise we may well say, this is our infirmity.

The second Petition. Disappoint him.
AFter that the Prophet hat^ desired the Lord to arise which is the first
degree of his de^liverance, he requires that the Lord would disappoint King
Saul and all the rest of his enemies Saul's Doegs and dogs, whom h^ includes
all under the word hi^ and that because they were join all together like one
man in the malice, against David the servan^ of the Lord.

The doctrine.
First, whereas here he callet^ all his enemies him, as one man, for their
banding together, I observ^ the great policy of the Devil who by all means
possible, en^deavoures to keep his servants i^ unity, that they may all do
evi^ together, as it were with one shoul^der, for he knows, that if hi^
Kingdom were divided, it could not stand; I read in Scripture o^ Michael and
his angels, Rev. 12.7
fighting against the Devil and his angels, but ^ can not read in any part of
one Devil fighting against another; ^hey are all guided by one Spirit, and have
all their minds one way ^ent to do evil; though they may be called legion,
for their judge great number, for the way ^o Hell has great store of
passen^ers, yet they all agree, and go ^s it were one Devil, ready with ^oth
hands to do a mischief.

The use: The use.
Let us by the practice of the wicked learn to abide together, and to be all
(as it were) ^ne man; it is GODS will, Judge. 20.8
it is Gods commandment, that we love one another; Joh. 15.17
Silurus a little before his death called all his children, and offered unto
them a sheafe of arrows knit together, desireing any of them to break them
which when they could not, he divided the arrows and gave unto them one after
another to be broken, which they brake easily; After that, he said unto them,
So shall it be with you, if ye abide together in unity, none shall be able to
overcome you, but if ye be divided, ye shall easily be overthrown.

Now let us consider what the Prophet here requires, it is that God would
disappoint his enemies. Antevertere anticipare.
The Hebrew word is Kiddam, which properly signifies to prevent, or
disappoint, for he that is prevented, is also disappointed: All Saul's designs
were how to trap David for to kill him; David's prayer here is, that the Lord
would disappoint him, or according as it is in the Hebrew, Kaddemah panau. The
doctrine.
that he would prevent his face.

Observe here, that great men may intend great matters against Gods servants,
but there is a great God in heaven who can easily disappoint them, whiles by
wisdom, and whiles by strength; As for his wisdom, Dan. 2.22
he understands all things; Daniel says, that the light dwells with him;
he is infinitely wise to prevent or avert: peril, or to rid us out of danger.
When King Saul intended to kill David in his bed, the Lord by his wisdom
delivered him, by directing Michal his wife, to lay an image in his bed, 1 Samuel
19 13
having a pillow of goats hair for his bolster, so when Saul's servants came
to take him, they were disappointed, they found nothing in the bed, but a
Teraphim, an image with a pillow of goats hair; As by wisdom, so the LORD
can by strength disappoint his enemies; when the Philistines called for Samson
to make them sport, Jud. 16.25
the Lord put a new strength in that blind man, whereby he drew down the
house upon his enemies, who got death for their sport, and so were
disappointed; In this land at home, we have proofs sufficient of God
disappointing our enemies; In the eighty eight year, there was nothing in
Spain to be heard, but a glorious victory against Britain, Have they not
sped? Jud. 5.30
have they not divided the prey, to every man a damsel or two? said the
Spanish Ladies, with the mother of Sisera; All our possessions were appointed
for that barbarous and cruel nation, but God disappointed them; All their
bragging was at last turned into b^gging, the Lord made them beggars in our
land: After that deliverance, the Papists intended, with six and thirty
barrels of powder under the Parliament house, to blow up all the Royal Blood,
with the flower of all our Nobility and Counselors, and after that, MISSA
massa farinaria.
to set up their Dagon of dowe, but the Lord by his wonderful wisdom
disappointed them; After that, the enemies of Christ's Gospel have been still
undermining this poor Church, under a covering of ceremonies; but when they
were almost come to the cope of their desires, even to give us the Mass
clothed with an English coat, most cunningly, woven from the top throughout,
with juggling words, words of two faces like the Oracles of Apollo, which one
way had a sense for Gods glory, but another way a sense for to make Christ
Jesus a dumb and a deaf idol, that all this nation at last should be partly
entised, partly constrained to return, to worship a god of bread, which can
not defend himself from the teeth of a Mouse; When this was almost achieved
and done, the Lord in a most wonderful manner disappointed them; After that,
they gathered their forces by Sea and Land to do by violence, what they could
not perform by wiles; the Lord (and not we) disappointed them; the Lord
(blessed for evermore) at Dunce-hill, Har-ezer mons adjutorij.
the hill of help, and at Newburne wrought their disappointment; East, West,
South, North the Lord has done great things for us; the LORDS hand has been
seen by Sea and by Land: Except our enemies hearts be harder then the heart
of Pharao, they must confess, and say with Pharaohs Magicians, Exodus 8.19
This is the finger of GOD.

The 1 use.
The 1 use Let us learn here to trust in God, in greatest dangers; even when
there is nothing, but confufed noise, Isa. 9.5
with garments rolled in blood, though our enemies were never so strong, our
God is able to disappoint all their designs; he will not suffer any weapons
to prosper that are lifted up against his servants; if we can stand still with
the foot of faith, Exodus 14 13
we shall not fail to see the Salvation of the Lord: Psalm. 23.4
In the valley of the shadow of death, we shall not need to fear any evil;
for he shall be with us; Exodus 15.3
the Lord, said Moses, is a man of war; and therefore let not our hearts
tremble for the boast of men, who are but like dogs barking at the Moon; it
is but little or nothing that man can do; What is he worth? Isa. 2.22
wherein is he to be accounted of? the Lord can easily disappoint all his
designs; Let GOD arise, Psalm. 68.1
and his enemies shall be scattered: These that hate him shall flee before
him; As smoke is driven away, so shall the Lord drive them away; as wax
melts before the fire, so shall the wicked perish at the presence of God.

The 2 use
The second use, When the enemies of God are strong, and are in plotting great
designs against GODS inheritance, let us here learn how to pray to God; let
us take unto us words even these words of this text, Arise, O Lord, and
disappoint them: If we cry unto the Lord, Arise, the Lord shall not fail to
answer, Now will I arise, Isa. 33.10
says the Lord; When He is risen he will work wonders; Isa. 33.11
Mine enemies, says He, shall conceive chafe, and bring forth stubble; thus
all their counsels shall be but a conception of chafe, and when their
designs are ready to be borne, they shall be but children of stubble; David in
the second Psalm considering how God makes the counsels, the conceptions of
wicked men to be but false conceptions, cried out, Psalm. 2.1
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? the word in
the Hebrew, signifies a trifle, RIK inane.
or emptiness, a nothing; He also there scorneth the vain Kings and Rulers of
the earth, and that because they take counsel against Christ; He that sits
in the heavens, says He, shall laugh, Psalm. 2.4
the Lord shall have them in derision; After that for a space he has laughen
at their folly, he will break them with a rod of iron, verse. 9
and dash them in pieces like a potters vessel: Thus the LORD brings down
the plots and designs of high-towring ambitious wicked men; Behold a real
disappointment; where now I pray you will all their designs, and their boasts,
and their armies be, when the Lord has broken them all into Shardes like an
old pitcher? Behold the men that would but burn and slay; Behold the men tha^
would have all their will; Behol^ the men that would neither be^ ruled by Gods
law nor Man's law but by their own wilful wills the LORD has thrown the^
down, the evil they would have done, it lay not in their hearts o^ hands to
do it; the LORD has tread them down, he hat^ wounded the head of his
enemies and the hairie scalpes of such a go on still in their trespasses they
are nothing but like a broken sheard; Psalm. 68.21
Behold them bridled by the power of this great LORD, who according to the
prayer of his servant, here has clearly before the eyes of the world
disappointed them; Let railing Rabshakehs not only boast men, but also GOD
himself with, where is the god of thi^ place, 2 King. 18 34
and the god of that place^ the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad, the gods of
Sepharvaim, Henah, and Juah? Let great men with Rabshakeh, threaten to cause
Gods people eat their own dung, 2 King. 18 27
and drink their own piss, but the LORD has hooks for their nose, 2 King.
19 28
and bridles for their lips, for to turn them back from their course: He shall
so cross their designs, that they shall go away disappointed with shame and
disgrace; Jos. 5.14
Christ the Captain of the Lords (...) is all fire, for the glory of (...)
Father and the well of his ^^^rch: his zeal was such that it did eat him up;
Joh. 2.17
but alas for our heart it is but like a cold sinder in our bosom.

The third Petition. Cast him down.
NOw it follovveth, that we hear David's third petition; Cast him down.

The Prophet here in his prayer goes on as Abraham did in hi^ request for
Sodom; He sought ay^ more and more, first that Go^ for fifties sake, Genesis 18.24
would spare the Cities, 28
Secondly that for fiv^ and fourties sake, 29
Thirdly, tha^ for fourties sake, Fourthly tha^ for thirties sake, 30
Fifthly that for twenties sake, 31
32
Sixthly and last that for tennes sake he would spare all the rest; So David
fir^ here entreated God but to arise After that, he desired God to do more,
even to disappoint his enemies; Thirdly here he desires more that the Lord
would hurl^ and cast down his adversaries.

The doctrine.
Observe here, what it is to be once familiar with God; The more a man be
acquaint with God he grows in boldness in hi^ suits: the prayers of a
Christian must not be dwarfes, still i^ one stature; They must grow up and be
enlarged; A man before ^e has tried Gods love and li^eralitie will but seek
small things from him: But as soon as he has ^een these Oceans of mercies, that
^re in Gods widest bowels, he will seek, and seek ay more and more; When ever
he looks upon God, he sees a full hand ready ^o give, he hears a mouth of
mercy, crying unto him, Psalm. 81.10
Open thy mouth very wide and I will fill ^t unto thee: It is not possible that
man that is not acquaint with God, can imagine how loving and liberal the Lord
is; for this ^ause, the wicked who are thick ^ghted, and by false spectacles
^ee him but a far in the works ^f the Creation, but not near ^n Christ,
seek nothing from God but earthly things, Psalm. 4.6
as wheat wine, and oil; When they are ^ull of these things, like a horse, ^
dog, or a cow that is full of meat, they lie down to sleep, and seek no
more; Such me^ are but beasts who know no^ what good things the LORD has in
his treasures for his Children If they get the earth, and earthly things, they
rest content, singing a Requiem to their souls with that fool in the Gospel,
who bad his soul eat, Luke 12.19
drink, an^ be merry, because he had provided much for it, Est aliquid quod in
ipsis floribus angat. Jon. 4.7.
and that for many years: This joy lasts not; The flovvre of it has ^
worm, like Jonahs gourd, it will anon wither and pass away.

The use.
The use; Let us be careful^ to know GOD, and his goodness; If we were once
well acquaint with him in our prayers, we should wonder what a boldness
should enter into ou^ hearts to go to GOD, and to seek, and seek ay more and
more. If he see our hearts honest, if we speak to him with sense and
feeling, Psalm. 109.164.
though seven ^imes a day, he will never say ^o us, Mal. 2.7.
as he says to Papists ba^ling on their beeds, ye weary ^e with your words;
No not, he is so glad of our conference that he has commanded us to ^ray
continually. 1 Thessalonians. 5.16.
Ye cannot be^eeve the half of that which I ^ay, until ye make proof and
^ake a trial of that which ye hear: O the unspeakable kindness of God; When
the Queen of Sheba, who had heard much of Solomon's glory, came her self and
saw, She said, that the report which She had heard of him was ^rue, and that
She could not be^ieve the words, until her eyes had seen it; But behold,
said She, 1 King. 10 7
^he half was not told me; thy wisdom and prosperity exceeds the fame
which I heard: Much more may this be said in things pertaining to God; the
tongue of Angels can not express the half of Gods goodwill toward the sons
of men; David kne^ this, and therefore he most earnestly exhorted all the
godly, t^ get knowledge of Gods goodness by their own experience O taste and
see how good is the LORD; Psalm. 34.8.
O but Gods children are dear to him, Oh that the^ were dearer to us then they
are Alas, beasts and fowls, hawke and hounds, are more dear to many, then the
dearest children o^ God; Julius Caesar perceiving women bearing little dogs
under their arms, enquired if they had n^ children; So it may be enquire of
many, that with great coa^ feed fowls and beasts for their pleasure, if GOD
have no chi^^dren for their charity; But O though men contemn such, y^ are
they dear to GOD, yea, s^ that the more familiare they be with him, they are
the more welcome; The more they seek, they come the better speed: Yea, he is
willing that they lean and ^est upon him, so that others see^ng this, Cant. 8.5
may wonder at such a familiarity, and say, who is this ^omming up from the
wilderness, ^eaning upon her welbeloved?

Now let us consider the petition it self; it is in these words, Cast him
down; The Hebrew word Carang, signifies proper^y to bow, to throw down with
^reat violence; The Psalmist ^eaking of these gluttons among ^e Israelites that
cried for flesh, ^aith, that after they were filled, ^he wrath of GOD came
down upon them; Pal. 78.31
and smote down the ^hosen men of Israel, The original word there signifies,
that he made them to bow, or that he ^hrew them down when a man falls in a
battle, or any way (...) death, he boweth down; This that which David here
desire the Lord to do to his enemies who could not be diverted from their
malicious purpose, even the he would bow them down by h^ strong and mighty arm.

The doctrine.
Observe here, what the Lord both can and will do to the en^^mies of his
servants: he will no fail to cast them down; This that which David here
require This is the prayer of the Church when the godly are persecuted b^
malicious men, who will not (...) recalled; God is a hearer of prayers; he
will not fail to thro^ down to the ground, all these the maliciously set their
face again him; If ye would have a pro^ of this, hear the speeches of Go^ and
of the proud King of Ba^ who smote Gods people in wra^ with a continual
stroke; I, sa^ that King, will ascend into heaven: Isa. 14.13
I will exalt n^ throne above the Stars of God, that is, I will do what I
please, let God say what he likes, but he lied: But what said the Lord? verse.
15.
the Lord spoke truth, Thou shall be brought down to hell, I shall cast thee
down; A man what ever he be, if once the Lord in wrath lay hands upon him,
shall be cast down, yea, down to the earth, yea, down to the hells, yea,
so down, that he shall never be able to rise again, I will overturne,
overturne, Eze. 21.27
overtu^ne, said the LORD. The 1 use.


The first use: Let this serve for instruction to great men, as Emperors,
Kings, and Princes; let such bevvarre, according to Gamaleels counsel, Act.
5.39
to fight against GOD. They for a space in the pride of their hearts may
ruffle, and strout, like Nebuchadnezzar, in his palace, with, Dan. 4.30
Is not this great Babel? yea, some will boast Go^ himself with Pharao,
saying who is the LORD? Exodus 5.2.
but such (...) all their greatest grandour, are bu^ like Chessemen, which
have some prerogatives upon the Chesseboard but O when the game is ended death
shuffleth both the King and the Pawn into one bag: vvit^ God is no respect
of persons; h^ cares neither for King nor Kes^^ if they proudly repine against
hi^ Majesty; Psalm. 20.12
when his wrath is kindled but a little, Eze. 21.27
he will overturne* overturne, overturne, their royal estates, break their
scepters into pieces, make their crown like the chafe of the Summer
threshing floor. David a King knowing this, that scepters and crowns when
GOD is provoked, are no^ Thunder-proofe, gave unto al^ Kings his counsel
concerning this; For after that he had spoken of the great power of God, in
breaking his most mighty enemies with a bar of iron, as though they were
the vessels of a potter, he cried out this notable vvatch-vvord, Psalm. 2.10.
Be wise therefore O ye Kings, etc. Serve the LORD with fear; Kiss the Son
lest he be angry; If ye do it not, ye shall all perish from the way, by the
sharpened keen edge of his justice, when his wrath is kindled but a little.
All things, would he say, shall then turn enemies to you; All the creatures,
both Angels and Men shall hate you, the Devils shall accuse you, and Christ
shall judge you, O then may be said, Anselm. Heu miser! sic deprehensus, quo
fugias? latere erit impossible apparere in tolerabile.
O wretch whither will thou flee while thou art thus surprised? for neither may
thou lurk, neither darre thou appear; This is said to thee, who in great
pomp marchest with thy train, a proud enemy of God and his Gospel; For a
time the LORD may suffer thee in thy caroch, to be gloriously whirled through
the streets, but tarry a little and God at last shall make of thee a footboy,
to run before a promoted Mord^cai.

The 2 use
The second use; Let this serve for comfort to Gods children, when they are
threatened with death by mighty Monarchs, because like Shadrach and his
fellows they will not worship an idol like that which was by King
Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 3.1
set up in the field of Durah: Let us remember well what these children, Dan.
3.28
who changed the Kings word, and yielded their bodies, said to that King
threatening them with death, if they would not worship his idol, Our God whom
we serve, Dan. 3.17
said they, is able to deliver us: without his permission; all the potentates
of the earth can not make a hair to fall from our head; though for a time they
trouble us, at last the Lord shall come and cast them down; Yea, and drown
them in a whirle-poole of his wrath, where no cork shall be able to bear
them aloft, were they Kings, if they persecute Gods Saints, at last the Lord
shall cast them down; So at last, 1 Samuel 31 4. 1 King. 22 35. Dan. 5.6
he cast down King Saul upon Gilboah, and he cast down King Ahab in his
bloody charet, and he cast down King Bellhazzar, fitting among his whoores;
he cast down that great Alexander, that vain man, Dan. 12.13
that could not with Daniel, rest and stand in the lot, content with his
station, but whined for lack of elbow room, because there was not another
world; The LORD made a short coffin to contain him, whom a whole world could
not content: Behold all the Emperors in Nebuchadnezzars image which he saw in
his sleep; Behold there the golden head of the Caldeans, the silver breast of
the Persians, the brazen belly of the Grecians, and the iron legs of the
Romans; But O again, behold a little stone cut out of the quarrey of heaven
without hand, even Christ Jesus the great Captain of Salvation, Heb. 2.10
who smote that image on the feet, so that all these Emperoures with their
Crowns and Scepters, Dan. 1.22
became like the chafe of the Summer threshing floores. Neither their
Scepters, nor their Crowns, nor their Guards, nor their Armies can uphold
them, when the LORD comes to cast them down; All their armies become like
these keepers about Christ's grave, who for fear at his resurrection, Mat. 28.4
became as dead men. The Lord God is against them, to justle with them in his
wrath, and therefore they carry hell, even a trembling heart in their bosom, and
the brand of vengeance in their foreheads, the shrewde wages of their
wickedness; Let these observations stand for our comfort.

The third use, The 3 use
Seeing the Lord is so powerful to cast down Princes, and Potentates, let
this serve for reproof to these, who can not trust in God, but tremble like
aspen leaves, when they see the great forces of men, or hear of them; Such are
not fit for Christ's wars; they gladly would dwell on Tabor with him, sitting
between Moses and Elias, but forsake him at Calvarie, hanging between two
Thieves; they like well his robbes of glory, but abhor his rags of
poverty, Hosanna has a sweet sound in their ears, but anon they shrink back
at these bitter bloody cries, of Crucify, Crucify; Israel had never conquered
Canaan, if they had been fearfully afraid of the sons of Anak: Away with men
that will not believe, except they touch and see; Such men's understandings are
led by their senses, they give more trust to their eyes, Plus oculo quam
oraculo.
then to the word of promise; if we could rightly fear God, if we had but the
least grain of faith, we would never fear things that have their breath in
their nostrils: Isa. 2.22
What is man that he should be feared? what can he do, though he had permission
to do all that is in his power? he can but kill the body, and so send us home
to our Lord: If men kill us not, a fever or a flux, or a Cancer, as well as a
Canon, or one of a thousand diseases, will come and take away our life: If we
did truly fear God, the terrors of men would not trouble us much; But because
we are negligent in prayer, and in prying into the heavens, for to know what
store of joy and contentments are there, therefore when a word of death or
danger is heard we are like that Pashur, whom Jeremie called Magor-Missabib,
that is, fear round about; Jer. 20.3
ly upon us, that any thing should be able to affright us, unto whom the Lord
has made so fair promises, that he will be unto us, a shield, and a shadow, a
Sconce, a strong tower, and a fortress, a hedge, a wall of fire, and of
brass; Is any man stronger then God* If any Prince can be found that can cast
down God, let us tremble and shake; If any other God can be found to whom a
man may say, in the words of may text, Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him
down, then let us tremble and go with Zedekiah from chamber to chamber for to
hide our selves; But this God of my text is the only true GOD; He is the God
of gods; when he is angry, he casts down the gods, as he threw down the
Philistines Dagon, 1 Samuel 5.13
and did execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt; Exo. 12.12
this our Lord at last shall bring a black day upon all the wicked, the enemies
of his Church; their groans in hell shall honor his justice, so well as the
songs in Heaven shall glorify his mercy; Now their conscience is like a clock
when the poise is down, the wheels are without motion, all is quiet, there is
no noise in the heart; but O as soon as the LORD shall set their wheels on
work, and waken them out of their unhappy dream, then shall their heart
break, and their tongue confess, and their Eyes weep, and their Hearts wring
with these doolefull desperate cries, Rev. 6.16
Rocks and Mountains fall upon us; this shall be most sweet music in the
Ears of the Godly, whom they in the world did tread under feet, as most
contemptible dongue.

The fourth Petition: Deliver my soul from the wicked, with thy Sword.
THE fourth petition is contained in these words, Deliver my soul from the
wicked with thy sword; In this petition David seeks his life from God;
deliver my soul, that is save my life; Because it is by the soul that we live,
the life is called the soul, For when once the soul is removed from the body,
the life tarieth no longer.

In this petition also may well be included, a holy desire for a spiritual
deliverance of his soul from sin and Satan, his spiritual enemies; for
doubtless when the enemies of the body are busy seeking our life, the Dive^
like a roaring Lion, 1 Pet. 5.8.
seeks us most earnestly that when we ar^ slain, he may get our souls;
Satan is most vigilant and busy t^ cause Battles of blood, that when men's
bodies are slain in an evil^ quarrel, he may get many souls And therefore
this should at a times be the man of wars ejaculatorie prayer, O Lord delive^
my soul from the wicked vvi^ thy svvord; This is for the preservation both of
soul and body.

The words of this petition are diversely interpreted; Some esteem that the
wicked here are called the Sword of God, Qui tibi vice gladii est.
that is in steed of a Sword: thus all the means of men's destruction are the
Lords Sword; According to this, Isa. 66.16
Isaiah says, that by fire and sword, the Lord will plead with all flesh; The
same Prophet in another place, says, Isa. 27.1
that the Lord with his sore and great and strong Sword, will punish Leviathan:
The Prophet Jeremiah cries out, O thou Sword of the Lord, Jer. 47.6.
how long wilt it be ere thou be quiet? Zeph. 2.12
The Lord in Zephaniah said to the Ethiopians, ye shall be slain by my Sword;
According to this interpretation, all means that God uses either to afflict
his children, or to destroy the wicked, are called his Sword; In this sense,
the wicked in my text according to the new Translation, are called Gods Sword,
deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy Sword, that is, the instrument
of thy correction.

Other interpret the words after this manner, deliver my soul from the wicked
with thy Sword; In the Hebrew there is only thy Sword, for with thy Sword, The
Chaldee has, Charbecha for Becharbecha.
who deserves to be slain by thy Sword; the Greek* gloss has using thy
Sword against him.

The sense of the whole petition is this, that the Lord would deliliver his
life from the wicked, which are the Sword or rod of his wrath; Isa. 10.5
Or that by his Sword, he would destroy the wicked, and so deliver his soul or
his life; this last interpretation seems best, for it is more likely, that
David here desires the Lord to deliver his soul from the wicked, with his
Sword, then that the wicked are GODS Sword* against him, for in this Psalm he
pleads for his own innocence, in all that concerned his enemies; I confess,
that if we look to God in our affections, though we be most unjustly wronged by
men, yet the Lord is ever righteous and most justly, may with the wicked as
with a rod scourge us for our trespasses against him; both interpretations are
good.

Now to come to the petition, Deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy
Sword, or with thy Svvord. After that he had prayed against his enemies, he
prays for himself, that the LORD would deliver his soul; The destruction of
our enemies, is but half comfort except that the Lord deliver us from dangers;
Indeed the destruction of Gods enemies is a fair way, for the deliverance of
Gods servants, After that Haman was hanged, Gods people had joy and gladness,
Esth. 8.17
a feast and a good day.

The use; The 1 use
Let us learn the right method of prayer, in these days of trouble; The Church
of God now has many adversaries, who are run together in a cluster like one
man in the singular number; Here we may learn what to say, Arise O Lord,
disappoint him, Cast him down; down with Doeg, the Deputy, the cursed
courteour; down with Zedekiah Canterburrie, the false Prophet, who by his
tyranny has smitten many a good Micajah on the cheeck, for courageously
withstanding of his Arminian lies; Down, down with that proud Prelate, whose
lips should have kept knowledge, Mal. 2.8.
and yet like these wicked Priests in Malachie, has made many to stumble at
the law Yea, and at the Gospel also by corrupting the Covenant of Levi; The
court made him fo^ge his Master Christ, as the second Coch of Egypt taught
Joseph ^o swear by the life of Pharao; Make thy arm now bare, Genesis 42.16
Lord, and cast down all thine enemies among us, but chiefly LORD, now down
with these bloody hounds of Ireland, these cruel Cannibals, 1 King. ^.5
who (like bloody Joab) have shed the blood of war in peace, and have put the
blood of war upon their girdles that were about their loins, and in their
shoes, that were on their feet, Let not their hoare heads go down to the
grave in peace.

If any others by authority or counsel have had hand in that blood, as the
Prophet Zachary said, when men were murdering him at the commandment of the
King, The Lord look upon it, 2 Chronicles. 24.2^.
and require it. O what a terrible count is above the head of these, who have a
hand in these most bloody divisions in England, now Aceldama, a field of blood,
where so many, like these two young men that came out of the two armies, to
play before Joab and Abner, thrust every one his sword into his fellows side,
and fall down together: O these red fields, made red mortar with the blood of
so many thousands! O is there not a God in Heaven? Will he not look upon all
this and require it, yea, and requite it? O let us pray that God would cast
down these men of blood; After that we have prayed thus, let us entreat the
LORD most humbly, to deliver our Souls with his sword from the rage of wicked
men.

The 2 use
Again, whereas this man of God seeks here deliverance from the Lord, let us
learn to whom to go, for to be in safety; Neither Ships by Sea, nor Castles
by Land, can deliver men's souls or lives; All these things are but vain
things; a blast of wind will throw down, and drown these Sea towers filled
with Canons; The strong holds on land, though they seem such as the blind and
the lame, 1 Samuel 5.6
might keep them against all forces of men, yet when the Lord is away, are
nothing but a lie; Psalm. 20.8
Some trust in Charets, and some in Horses; But we will remember the LORD our
GOD, from him is our deliverance; And therefore in days of danger, Let every
man here learn what to say to God, O LORD deliver my soul from the wicked,
with thy Svvord.

The thing he desires GOD, to deliver here, it is his soul, that is his life,
for the soul is the cause of our life; Also by the soul here may be understood,
the soul properly, and that the LORD would deliver it from danger, either in
doing or suffering; for when a man does evil, he endangereth his soul, or when
a man is persecuted, his soul also is not without danger; If he live, except
God save and sanctify him, his soul will fret impatiently, or will be enflamed
with revenge, 1 Samuel 25 13
as David was against Nabal, for his churlishness; Or if at the running out of
his last sand he die in battle, the bloody sword in the hand, except the Lord
deliver his soul, he cannot be but in great danger.

The 3 use.
The third use; Let us make good use of these words, Deliver my soul; they are
good for days of trouble, either for life, or for death, when it like a ster
ne Serjant shall come to arrest our bodies in the grave; By this prayer our
life is guarded against the rage of men, and by this prayer the Soul is fenced
from the danger of damnation: In these words is advantage both in life and
death; these words should at all times be in all men's mouths, both at our
rising, and at our lying down, in sickness and in health: But above all, let
all men of war in their greatest dangers arm themselves with this
ejaculatory prayer, LORD, del^ver my Soul; these a^e words which every
Christian must take with him while he goes to the battle.

But because God hears not the prayers of sinners, and this time of trouble
is a time of prayer, let us endeavor by all means with all haste to be
reconciled unto God; Truly, the best of us may say that we have a huge bottom
of sin to unravell by repentance, which we have been many years winding up
by our great disobedience: the work is great, the time is short, we know not,
but this war may make an end of us all, Let us therefore no more hazard our
salvation upon a may be, we live unto another year; I confess that no man
should despair of GODS mercy at any time, but this is as true that no man
should presume of it at any time; One has observed this well, There was one
these at his lives end saved, to take away desparation, and but one so saved
to take away presumption.

These from whom David, here prays to be delivered are called the wicked;
Such were the enemies that sought his life.

The doctrine.
Observe here, that it is no new thing, that GODS servants are troubled by the
wicked; This controversy began very early; For Cain the wicked killed the
righteous Abel: Genesis 4.8.
He had no quarrel against him, but because he was more sincere in Gods
service then he; A thief hates the light, as Ahab hated Micaiah, 1 King. 22 8
because by the torch of the word, he shined upon his works of darkness.

The use; The use.
As long as wicked men are in the world, let Gods children look for dangers to
their souls; There is nothing that will content wicked men, but the souls or
lives of Gods servants; King Ahab was sick ay until Naboth was dead, but as
soon as the poor man was dead, the wicked King arose up in health, 1 King. 21
16
and went down to the poor man's vineyard to take possession of it; it is health
for the wicked to destroy the children of God; They are like the Devil, it is
their meat and their drink to do evil; Let this teach us to pray continually,
that God would deliver our soul from the wicked.

Again whereas the wicked here according to some interpretation is called
Gods Sword Let us learn here when the wicked persecute us, not to look so much
to them who are the rod Sword or stafe, as unto the hand of God, in which the
rod sword or staff are; it is but for beasts as dogs, to bite the staff
when they are stricken, but Gods children must fix their eye upon the hand;
When wicked Shimei railed upon David, and cast stones at him, calling him a
bloody murderer. David would not suffer Abishai to touch him, for he had his
eye upon GOD. The LORD, 2 Samuel 16 10
said he, has said unto him, curse David who then shall say, wherefore have
thou done so? This is a great argument of patience for Gods children, when they
are afflicted or persecuted by the wicked, for all the wicked, while they
afflict us, are but a rod or staff in the hand of GOD; Isa. 10.15
If we can get Gods favor, we need no more be afraid for the wicked, then for
a Staff or Svvord lying upon the ground they should once see this our Captain
with his Sword in his hand, they should all fall down as dead-men at his feet;
when Captain Gideon went out against the Midianites, he cried, Judge. 7.20
THE SWORD OF THE LORD, AND OF GIDEON; After that, not a man had either heart
or hand, to fight against Gods people.

The use; The use.
Let us by all means endeavoure by a good life to please GOD, that this great
Captain with his sword may be on our side in these days of war: the Papists
idol is nothing, Hos. 8.5
thy Calf, O Samaria, has cast thee off; But O the LORD will never cast us
off; If he be with us, we need not fear who be against us; Lappers of water,
Judge. 7.5
any body (though both few and weak) will prevail easily, Luke 12.32
if GODS Sword be in the Battle; Fear not little flock said Christ; stand
still, said Moses to his six hundredth thousand fighting men, ye need not draw a
Sword, the Lord shall fight for you; Exodus 14.13.
Only stand still, and ye shall see what GOD can do; Ye shall see the
Salvation of the LORD; Psalm. 68.21
Who shall wound the head, and break the hairie scalp, of all these that in
their pride shall rise up against us; We shall be able to stand against all
weathers and storms whatsoever: What ever our dangers be, the LORD shall give
us a riddance; We shall be in Covenant with the Stones of the Earth, and the
Stars of Heaven, who (as in the day of Sisera (shall fight in their courses
against all our enemies; Judge. 5.20
In the day of Battle, the Lord shall break the Horse hooves of our enemies,
Judge. 5.22
by the means of the pransings, the pransings, that is, tramplings or
plungings of the mighty ones; It shall be at last sung in a song of victory,
verse. 27.
At our feet they bowed and fell, at our feet they bowed and fell; Where they
bovved, there they fell down dead; All our enemies (like Adam in his sin)
shall flee away, and thrust their head in a bush; If we be Gods friends, God
shall be their enemy, whether they fight in valleys or hills, let them hitch
up as high as they can, were it to set their nest among the Stars, Obad. 4.
thence shall he bring them down; As mountains could not save his enemies in
the day of water, neither shall the fountains save them in the last day of
fire; GODS friends may well say, Psalm. 66.12
we went through fire and water, but his foes are burnt in the one, and
drowned in the other; they shall not be able to make any shift for a shelter;
Let us flee, Exodus 14 25.
said the Egyptians, for the LORD fights for Israel; This at last shall be
the case of all our enemies, though they were in number like the sand, Judge.
7.12
if we by a reformed life, study to please him who is the GOD of armies; for
as Moses sang at the red Sea, Exodus 15.3
The LORD is a man of War, he triumphingly at the last sets his foot upon the
necks of all his enemies; But if we provoke GOD by our sins, Josh. 7.20
as Achan did at Jericho: If we grieve the Angels, who clap their vvings for
joy at our conversion, Luke 15.10
if we make grief to go to these thresholds of joy; if we make these
ministering Spirits to blush at our wicked deeds, Heb. 1.14
if we draw back, Heb. 10.38
so that GODS soul have no pleasure in us, if we rebel and vex his holy
Spirit, Isa. 66.10
and for to speak so, morgage our salvation, or by some bastard idle thoughts,
barter away the joys of a good conscience, for any triffles of pleasure,
profit, or preferment, like Esau, who preferred pottage to his birthright,
Genesis 25.34
or like the Gergesites, who desired Christ the Savior to depart from their
costs, Mat. 8.34
that they might save their swine; in a word, if such wicked thoughts lodge
within us, we shall in the day of Battle flee like sheep scattered on the
mountains; 2 Chronicles. 18.16.
When the Israelites fled shamefully from before the men of Ai, the Lord
declared to Joshuah their great General the cause of their flight; Israel has
sinned, Josh. 7.11
and have transgressed my Covenant, etc. verse. 12.
Therefore they could not stand before their enemies; If Generals of armies
would not (with Joshuah) be ashamed of the flight of their soldiers, let
them by all means endeavor, that no wicked persons be tolerate in their
armies; For all such are but like Cuckoos, which for a little space in Summer,
will sing a scurvy note to us, but are sure to be gone before the winter blasts
come; Such profaine villains will do no good in the day of danger, when they
must face a bloody field; and therefore, a General must say of his army, as
David said of his house, I will walk within my house or in my army, Psalm.
101.2
with a perfect heart, shall not tarry in my sight: I The General of an army
should not only honor GOD himself, but also carefully see that he be
honored by others, and should contemn all honor that is joined with contempt
of Christ's Majesty; It is storied of Gotherey of Boloigne, a most excellent
warrior, that being in the very heat and hight, of his honor he refused to
be crowned in Jerusalem with a Crown of gold, and that because Christ his
Lord had there been crowned with a Crown of thorns: O then what honor can
come from these profaine, who by wounds and passions, and bloody oaths, and
other vilest vices, Heb. 6.6
do crucify again the King of glory? Let these be the words of a generous
General, I hate the work of them that turn aside, it shall not cleave to
me, a froward heart shall depart from me, I will not know a wicked person,
etc. These that delight in lies, shall not tarry in my sight: these who with
Achan play punks, for to fill their trunks with a golden wedge, Josh. 7.21
them will I cut off, with all other vicious persons, who like drunkards are
courageous at the Barrel, but cowards at the Battle, Tumidi potando, timidi
pugnando.
all such that want grace, shall have no place in my favor; Let all Captains
make this, a rule of their military Discipline, wherewith, as by a curb they
may powerfullie pull in all these, that give loose reins to themselves in all
sorts of riot; If this be carefully done, they shall have their soldiers full
of heart and health, strength and courage, 1 Samuel 17 13
to draw the strongest cities with ropes in a river; they (like Saul and
Jonathan) shall be swifter then Eagles, 2 Samuel 1.23
and stronger then Lions; The LORD shall teach their hands to war, so that a
bow of steel shall be broken by their arms, Pal. 18.34
their enemies when they see them, shall all aghast with ghastly looks cry with
the Egyptians at the red Sea, Let us flee from the face of Israel, Exodus 14.25
for the LORD fights for them against us; Thus shall it be done to the army
of these that in holiness fight the Battles of the LORD; In whose royal hand
is the royal gift of victory, in this life, and after this life, the
victorious wreaths, with palms in hands, Rev. 7.9
and crowns on heads in the Heaven of Heavens, the place of our desired rest,
and the rest of all our desires. To him be glory, for ever, Amen.

A PRAYER FOR AN ARMY, IN THE DAY OF BATTLE.
O LORD, the great GOD of Armies, and commander of Battles, in whose hand is
the breath of all men, who have a full power to save or destroy, there is none
like unto thee.

We who stand in great need of thy help, entreat thee for thy mercy this day;
Let not the sins of any, like the sin of Achan deprive us of thy assistance
and protection, at this present time: Remember not against us our former
iniquities, forgive them, and forget them, pity us and pardon us; Be pleased
with us, for the sake of Christ Jesus in whom thou art well pleased.

Now LORD this day is appointed for the Battle, and every battle of the
warrior is with confused noise, Isa. 9.5
and tumbling of garments into blood; We know, that he that girdeth on his
harness, 1 King. 20 11
must not boast as he that puts it off; The prosperous success of all good
enterprises is to be looked for from thee; It is as easy for thee to save, by
few as by many, and therefore we all here armed for thy honor depend only
upon thy assistance; We trust that according to thine infinite goodness thou will be powerfully with us, and for us, who stand here ready to lay down our
lives at thy feet, for thy glory, the good cause, for that holy Covenant which
we have made with thee, and which now we mind to seal with our blood.

Though we deserve to be deserted of thee, because of our manifold sins,
and great ingratitudes, yet for the honor of thy Name, Let not thine Israel
this day shamefully turn their back before the enemy; Deuteronomy. 32.27.
O LORD fear the bragges of thy foes, who, if we be tread down, will
scornfully say, where is now their God? and where is their Covenant? and where
is their good Cause? they will surely say, Ibid.
Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.

Seeing now, LORD, we are presently for to rencounter with the forces of men,
and for to set our breasts before the Canon, Musket, Sword, and Spear, in this
valley of the shadow of death; be thou our Captain, Psalm. 23.4
go before us, give us wisdom, and courage, and strength; take the hearts
from our enemies, make their hands faint, and their knees feeble; make thy
promise good, five of you shall chase an hundred, and a hundred of you shall
put ten thousand to flight. Lev. 26.8


O LORD, the protector of thy servants, make all fear of death now flee far
from us, give us the boldness of David with his good success, in going out
against these uncircumcised enemies of thy truth; They come out ^^ainst us with
the force of Men, ^^d Munition, with Horses, Swords, Spears, and Shields,
but we go against them under thy standart, in the name of the LORD of
hosts, the GOD of Armies of Israel; Through thee we shall do valiantly.

But LORD, if for such causes as are known to thee, it be thy will that at
this time an end be made made of any of our lives, let it please thy sacred
Majesty to receive our souls into the bosom of thy love: Though our bodies
fall into the hands of men, Let our souls fall into the hands of God, whose
compassions fail not.

Now Father into thy hands we commend our Spirits.

Now in thy Name, under thy Banner, we thy Servants, and Soldiers, go to this
chocke, O Lord be our captain, and go before us, and fight for thine own cause.

this multitude; O LORD thou art our GOD, Let not man prevail against thee.

letter, full of threatenings.

messengers, and read it; And Hezekiah went up to the house of the LORD, and
spread it before the Lord.

dwell between the Cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone of all the
Kingdoms of the earth, thou have made heaven and earth.

be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

12 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his
counsel: For he shall gather them as the sheaves into the flooore.

13 Arise and thresh, O Daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and
I will make thy hooves br^sse, and thou shall beat in pieces many people: and I
will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of
the whole earth.

Mica. 4.11. Now also many nations
Are gathered against thee;
That say let her now be defiled,
On Zion cast our eye.
12 But they the Lords thoughts do not know,
Nor yet his counsel pure:
For he by force shall gather them,
As sheaves into the floor.
13 Arise, O dear daughter Zion,
Thine enemies to threin:
For I will now make thine horn iron,
And will make thy hooves brass.
And I unto the Lord of Hosts
Will consecrate their gain;
And to the Lord of the whole earth
Their substance will ordain.
A thanksgiving after the Victory.
O Lord, what thy servant Moses said in his song at the red Sea, that may we
all say this day, Exo. 15.3.
The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name.

Thy name, O Lord is glorious and worthy to be praised; the sorrows of death
had compassed us, and the floods of ungodly men had made us afraid, but thou
have been our strength and our stay in the day of our danger.

In the valley of the shadow of death thou have been our Captain and
defender; Psalm. 23.4
Through thee we have done valiantly, and thou have tread our enemies under
our feet; by thy strength we have pushed them down; the safety is ours, but
all the glory shall be thine, Zach. 1.3
who art the Lord of Hosts, who by thy mighty arm have brought low the high
looks of these, who trusted in their Horses and Charets, which thou have
teared in pieces; thou have driven them away as smoke, Psalm. 68.2
and have made them to melt like wax before the fire.

O LORD by thy almighty power, we have run through their troops, and put them
to a speedy flight, We have pursued our enemies and overtaken them, neither
did we turn again, till they were consumed; we have vvounded them that
they were not able to rise; they are fallen under our feet, for thou have
girded us with strength unto the Battle; thou have subdued under us these that
rose against us; thou have given us the necks of our enemies: We have beaten
them small as the dust before the vvind: we have cast them out as the dirt of
the streets; Thy gentleness has made us great; By thee this day is ours, we
most heartily acknowledge all the matter of our joy to be from thee.

O LORD, who is like unto thee? who is GOD save the LORD? or who is a rock
save our God? The Lord lives, and blessed be our rock; let the God of our
salvation be exalted, Psalm. 18.34
who has taught our hands to war.

Let all creatures praise the Lord; praise him from the heavens, praise him all
ye his Angels and Hosts, praise him ye Sun and Moon, and all ye Stars
of light: praise him from the earth, fire and hail, snow and vapor, heat and
cold, rivers, hills, and vallayes, all weapons of war swords, spears,
muskets, and conons, and all other things that have been steadable to help
the Lord, to help the Lord, etc. Judge. 5.23


With all these, we the whole body of this army, with our hearts to heaven, do
sing Hallelujah, most humbly acknowledging both the victory, and every one of
our particulare safeties to be from thee, who art God over all things, blessed
for ever, and ever, Amen.

Psalm. 57.12. Thy vows are upon us, O God; we will render praises unto thee.
Let us now in a most hearty thanksgiving sing the eighteenth Psalm, from the
33. verse, until the 39.

33 He did in order put my hands
to battle, and to fight:
To break in sunder bars of brass
he gave mine arms the might.
34 Thou teach me thy saving health,
thy right hand is my tower:
Thy love and familiarity
do still increase my power.
35 And under me thou make plain
the way where I should walk:
So that my feet should never slip,
nor stumble at a balk.
36 And fiercely I pursue and take
my foes that me annoyed:
And from the fields do not return
till they be all destroyed.
37 So I suppress and wound my foes
that they can rise no more:
For at my feet they fall down flat,
I strike them all so sore.
38 For thou do gird me with thy strength
to war in such a wise:
That they be scattered all abroad
that up against me rise.
The Lord has done great things for us; to him be glory for ever, Amen.

FINIS.
