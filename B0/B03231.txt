AN ELEGY On the Great and Famous BLEW-STONE, Which lay on the CASTLE-HILL of
EDINBURGH, and was Buried therein.
WHAT Place is this I Have fixed my Feet upon?
It Is like the Castle-hill, yet I miss a Stone
Whereon I leaned me often for Recreation,
Sure here is the place where was his Situation:
None ever was yet so strong to have it carried,
So that it is surely sunk, or else been burri'd:
For which there ought to be great Lamentation,
Since that it is Equal scarce was in a Nation.
O! let us lament the Loss that is sent
From Castle to the Town,
Would we withstood this blue Stones good
That Is now beneath the Ground:
Rise up and stand and grace our Land,
Let them thy Motto see,
Our old Blew-stone that is dead and gone,
His marrow cannot be:
Large Twenty Foot of length he was,
His bulk none ever did ken,
Dour and Deaf and riven with Grief,
When he preserved Men:
Behind his Back a Batt'rie was,
Contrived with Packs of Woo;
Let Us now think oh, since he is gone,
We Are in the Castle's view.
O! Burgesses and Men of Wit,
That lives into the Town,
What do you mean, or have you seen,
To let him so plump down.
Since all is past and he lies fast,
His Memory shall stand
To Thousand Generations,
In this our Ancient Land.
O Graver good will ye but do it,
Put this upon a Stone
Near to his Nest, see that it rest,
Since he is dead and gone.
EPITAPH,
Who ever this Grave does look upon,
And ask, who does it fill,
It is the Famous Great Blew-Stone
Lay on the Castle-hill;
Roared at he was with Shots like Thunder,
Because that Men he served,
Until his Body rent assunder,
because he them preserved
From Death that Night
