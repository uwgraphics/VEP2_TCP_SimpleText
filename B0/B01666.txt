A Lusty stout Ioyner he had a fair Wife.
A Broker he loved as dear as his life;
He sought by all cunning how he might ensnare,
And draw into evil this beautiful fair.
The Broker he courted this beautiful dame,
So hot and so eager he was at the game;
He said twenty Guineys on thee I Will bestow,
If thou will be willing some kindness to show.
With modest behavior his suit she denied,
And would in his presence no longer abide;
But telling her husband for what he did sue,
And likewise the Guineys he proffered her too.
The Ioyner he smiled when hearing this news,
And likewise was loath such a booty to loose;
He bid her seem willing and take the reward,
And tell him at night you will kindness afford.
Now by his inventions a snare he had laid,
Wherein this rich Broker in short was betrayed,
Next proffer of kindness, she ceasing to frown,
Ask him for his Guineys he tendered them down.
Then home to her chamber she did him invite,
To come about eight of the clock in the night;
For my unkind husband has taken his roam,
To see his relations and left me at home.
The Broker he kissed her and caper'd for joy,
Because she no longer did seem to be coy,
He thought every hour as long as a day,
But now you shall hear how they did him betray.
The long looked for hour at length he beheld,
His heart with abundance of joy then was filled
She showed him his lodgding where he was to lie,
And solemnly said she would come by and by.
While he lay expecting his Amorous Dame,
They sent for his Wife, who immediately came;
To whom the whole story at length they did tell,
And bid her with patience her sorrow expel.
His Wife was amazed at what they had told,
And being resolved likewise to behold:
The depth of this frolic before she did go,
They likewise was willing that it should be so.
The Ioyner and his Wife they tarried below,
While she to her husband in her stead did go:
And when she came almost unto the Bedside,
O why did thou tarry so long he replied.
She being not hasty to pull off her clothes,
The Broker in kindness immediately rose,
With kisses he called her the joy of his life,
Supposing it had been the Ioyners fair wife.
She softly did whisper, it is a great sin,
Which your fond allurements are drawing me in;
I never in my life did commit such a crime,
And therefore I now am unw^lling this time.
My dear be not fearful but let us enjoy,
Our freedom of pleasure, here none can annoy:
I Will give thee choice Jewels with plenty of Gold,
Let me not stand courting my love in the cold.
These large protestations I pray Sir forbear,
Since you have a Wife that is beauteous and fair:
Said he, she was never admired by me.
I love thee a thousand times better then she.
He knew not he talked to his wife all the while,
At length she began for to rant and revile,
She teas'd him and tore him about in his Shirt,
Nay kicked him and thumpt him and beat him like dirt*
It was in the dark, and she having a Mask,
He thought that the Devil had took him to task:
The heat of her fury she never forbears,
Until she had tumbled him headlong down stairs.
His head knees and Elbows, was broke with the fall,
For mercy and pity the Broker did call:
But yet such a peal in his ears she did ring,
He wished he had never attempted the thing,
The Ioyner and his Wife they parted the fray,
But never a word of the Guinneys did say,
Nor yet the poor Broker, alas, for his life,
For fear of the anger and rage of his wife.
The Broker he said, my sweet Wife now forgive
This thing, and i will never do the like while I live:
In pity she pardoned her husband his crime,
And likewise she bid him beware the next time.
