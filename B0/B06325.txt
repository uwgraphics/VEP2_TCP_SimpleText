TYBURN's Courteous Invitation TO TITUS OATS.
OH! name it once again; will Titus come?
My dearest, hopeful, that long-wish'd for One,
For whom my Triple Arms extended were,
(To hug with close Embraces) many a year.
Have! have! my choicest Darling, whom I love,
And thy long-promis'd kindness let me prove.
That Right Thou plead'st for, which indeed's thy due,
Though Others I Have denied, I Will grant it You:
The World shall find I willingly will bear,
And dance thy Carcass 'twixt the Earth and Air.
In Hemp'n-string I Will lull thee fast asleep,
And prevent all the Dangers of the Deep.
Oh, how I love thee! 'cause I Have heard thou'st been
So well acquainted with all kinds of Sin,
And, with a false and strange Religious Guise,
Destroyed the Innocent, abused the Wise.
What crafty Lessons did thou teach to men!
How to Rebel, and told the time best when;
Urged to Exclude a Right and Lawful Heir,
Unthrone a King, and swore away a Peer.
Thy Zeal through two-inch-Boards was plainly seen,
When Satan prompt thee t'swear against the QUEEN:
Besides those many guiltless Souls that died
A Sacrifice to thy Lucif'rian Pride.
Yet, yet, beloved Titus, my dear Son,
(Reputed SAVIOR, for thy Mercies shown,)
There Is something still does add to make thee Great,
Thy Blasphemy, thy Perjury; and yet
With Buggery methinks I am well pleased,
Though done by force, for then thy Pocket's eased.
By many other Favors Thou have shown,
And well may claim my Palace as thine own:
Thou Wilt find me kinder far than Courtiers; I
will never turn thee out until thou die:
And, since White Hall has left thee, I Will provide
That Lodging for Thee, where old Noll was tied.
Printed by N. T. at the Entrance into the Old-Spring-Garden, 1684.
