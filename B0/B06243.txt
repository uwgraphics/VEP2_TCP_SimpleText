The true Lovers Admonition.
Of all the Colors in the world,
the black hair is the best,
Though fair and brown may be well curled
yet black exceeds the rest:
That is the color I do prize,
and love beyond all measure,
She that has black Hair and black eyes,
esteem her as a treasure.
The Tune is, So Sweet is the Lass that Loves me,






You pretty little young men all,
come listen to my Ditty,
Beware how you in love do fall
I Would have you wise and witty:
But whensoe're you make a vow
besure you do not break it,
For there be fair Young Maids enough,
that willingly will take it.
Let me a little you advise,
that when you go a Wooing,
You may choose, one that is fair and wise,
least it be your undoing:
The Lass that has a rouling eye,
(...) will vow and quickly break it
Though she at first seem to deny,
I Will warrant thee boy she will take it
Do not thou choose a long nosed Lass,
for she is inclined to scolding
And be to thee a plague alas!
be not to her beholding:
What though she store of money has,
you would better take one naked,
Not one in twenty that draws breath,
but will go near to take it.
And she that is splay-footed too,
i would have thee not to mind her,
But choose you one that is fair and true
if you know where to find her:
For here and there you will find one fair,
will vow and will not break it
Not one in ten I say again,
but will go near to take it.


The Carrot pate be sure you hate,
For she will be true to no man,
But put her to it and she will do it,
and often turns very common:
She that is red upon the head,
will doubtless never forsake it,
But wanton be, assuredly,
and willingly will take it.
She that has hair that is bright and fair,
will do the trick most neatly,
Of her i would have you have a care,
least she cheat you completely:
Then do not try, for certainly,
if you but at her shake it,
She will conclude you are not rude,
but freely she will take it.
The Crump, the Hopper-arse and all,
will make you no denial,
They willingly will take a fall,
if you come to the trial:
You Would find that I speak merrily,
by no means will forsake it,
It is well known there is few or none,
but willingly will take it,
The old, the young, the weak, the strong,
full easily are tempted,
They will not be persuaded from,
nor from it be exempted:
Then have a care all colored hair,
will right and reason make it,
To use their own, since it is known
that more or all will take it.
But let me not forget to praise,
the Glory of the Nation,
For there is none that now adays,
are free from Loves temptation:
Except it be the black, and she,
hates Lust and will forsake it,
She Will live and die contentedly,
and never mind to take it.
Except it be with her own Dear,
and then she will never deny it,
To trade a touch, then there is no fear,
but she will resolve to try it
And willingly she will comply
though it were to lie stark naked,
For it is well known, that with ones own,
it is no shame to take it.
Then you that do Wooing go,
be by a friend advised.
For why, good counsel you do know,
too often is despised,
Take some girls by the Petticoat,
and do but gently shake it,
Then presently she will plainly show't
that merrily she will take it.
And now for to conclude I say,
you ought for to be careful,
That you throw not your selves away,
then be exceeding fearful:
Try but the black how she does smack,
she will vow and never will break it,
First do her wed, then go to Bed.
and I warrant she will take it.
