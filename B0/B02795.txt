Amintor's lam^^tation (...)
Setting forth the passion of a Young man, who falling in love with a coy Lady
that had no kindness for him, persued his inclinations so far, that she was
forced to fly beyond Sea, to avoid the importunity of his Address, whereupon he
thus complains.
Both Sexes from this Song may learn,
of what they should beware:
How in extremes they may discern,
Unkindness and despair.
To a delicate New Tune: Or, Since Celias my foe.


SInce Celia's my Foe,
To a Desert I Will go,
Where some River
for ever
shall echo my Woe!
The Trees will appear
More relenting than her,
In the morning,
adorning,
each Leaf with a tear.
When I make my sad moan,
To the Rocks all alone,
From each hollow
Will follow
some pitiful groan:
But with silent disdain,
She requites all my pain:
To my mourning,
returning,
no answer again.
O why was I born,
To a Fate so forlorn,
To inherit,
Not merit
her anger, or scorn:
My affection is such,
As no blemish can touch,
Yet i am flighted,
and spighted
for loving too much.
Perhaps could I prove,
More unjust to my love,
I might find her,
yet kinder,
and pity might move,
But i will choose to obey,
Though I dye by the way;
Yet it is better,
Than get her,
by going astray.






Then why should you fly,
My fair Celia? O why?
When to please ye
it is casse,
for Amyntas to dye.
If your Lover you would shun,
You no danger shall run,
Him you banish
will vanish,
And from you he gone.
Stay Celia unkind,
Will you leave me behind,
Let me enter,
and venture
my self with the Wind.
Ah! from me will you part,
Who so love your desert,
Either tarry,
Or carry
your slave with his heart.
Were you but secure,
I Would your absence endure,
Were all danger
a stranger
to Virgins so pure:
But some insolent wave,
May your merit out brave,
Both regardless,
and careless
What virtues you have.
Yet Storms shall not dare,
To assault one so fair,
To attend you
i will send you,
sighs softer than air:
The Nymphs of the Deep,
My dear Celia shall keep,
On a Pillow,
each Billow
Shall lull you asleep.
The Seas they shall dance,
And the Winds shall advance,
With your Gally
To dally,
and guide you to France;
While I from the Shore,
My fair Idol adore;
Till that Neptune
your Captain,
Has wafted you over.
Then Celia adieu,
When I cease to pursue,
You Will discover
No Lover
was ever so true,
Your sad Shepherd flies
From those dear cruel eyes,
Which not seeing
his being,
Decays and he dies.
Yet it is better to run
To the fates we cannot shun,
Then for ever
T'endeavor
what cannot be won:
What ye Gods have I done
That Amintor alone,
Is thus treated,
and hated
for loving but one?
And thus I complain,
Tho it is all but in vain,
Yet the trouble
is double,
to stifle my pain:
The Sea or the Shore,
I as well might implore,
They Are as moving,
and loving
as her I adore.
Then since it is the fate
Of my wretched estate,
Without pity,
It Is fit I
submit to her hate.
For as Winter comes on
When Apollo is gone,
So declining,
and pining,
She leaves me alone.
Printed for P. Brooksby, near the Hospital-gate in West-smithfield.
