The Huntsmans Delight, Or, the Forresters Pleasure.
The Dear are wounded, but they are not sl^in,
Yet so they are wounded, that they are over tain;
And in their taking pity it is shown:
for why, 'twas thought that some there was with fawn.
The Keepers swore great Oaths, upon their lives,
they would be as kind to them, as men are to their wivess,
the pleasant sport this Ditty does declare,
Of the Huntsmen, and the fallow Dear.
By I. M.
Tune of, amongst the leaves so green a.


COme all you young Maidens and lend an ear
Come listen a while and you shall hear
How the keepers did sport with the fallow Deer
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down derry derry down,
Hey down down, ho down down,
Hey down, ho down, derry derry down
Amongst the leaves so green a.
The keepers would on a hunting go,
And under their coats each carried his Bow,
And all for to shoot the bonny bonny Do,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down derry derry down,
Hey down down, ho down down,
Hey down, ho down, derry derry down,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
They spyed five Does upon a hill,
And to shoot at them was their good will,
But none of them they meant for to kill,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
At the first Do they shot at and they mist,
The second Do they clipped and they kissed,
And they laid them down where no (...) a wist
Amongst the leaves so green a.




The one cried out unto the other,
I am served as my Father served my mother.
All the fear of their taking this joy did smother
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
The third Do she made great moan,
Bcause that she was big with Fawn.
Which made her to go weeping home,
From among the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
The Fourth do could no longer stay,
But she must be gone her way,
For fear that the keepers should her lay
Amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
But soon after she did repent,
And to turn again she was full bent,
To lie down and take her hearts content,
amongst the leaves so green a.
hey down, etc.
The fifth Do leapt over the style,
But the keeper he got her by the heel,
And there he did both kiss and feel
amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, etc.
He pricked her straight with his dart
But she cried out she felt no smart,
And therein lay the keepers art,
amongst the leaves so green a.
Hey down, (...)
These fair Does they leapt and they skipt,
Till leaping along, at length they were tript,
No sooner they fell, but the keepers they clipped,
amongst the leaves so green a.
hey down, etc.
These bold Huntsmen were all agreed,
And by consent these fair Does did bleed,
But after that came often to feed
amongst the leaves so green a.
hey down, etc.
Great crowds came running over the plain,
Expecting to see these fair does slain,
But like fools as they came they returned again
From amongst the leaves so green a.
hey down, etc.
If it be true as old wives say,
Take a Do in the month of May,
And a Forresters courage she soon will allay
amongst the leaves so green a.
hey down, etc.
These Huntsmen were so gentle inclined
They set them^elfe their courage to find,
But away they tript, so swift as the wind,
From among the leaves so green a.
Hey down derry derry down;
Hey down down, ho down down,
Hey down, ho down, derry derry down,
Amongst the leaves so green a.
