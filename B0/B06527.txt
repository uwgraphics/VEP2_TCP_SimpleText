Licensed according to Order.



ATtend to this Relation,
Which I in kindness bring you,
The Wonder of the Nation,
My loving Friends, I sing you;
The like was never known before,
There Is a Lady that exceeds Threescore,
By six or seven Years,
This of a Truth apears,
That now this very day,
She is with Child, and may
Have two or three, they say,
For Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
This was an ancient Lady,
Who had both Bold and Treasure,
In Bags and Coffers ready;
Yet wanted youtful Pleasure;
The Knight her Hushand being dead,
With her Servant William she did wed,
A proper Man indeed,
Who at a time of need,
Could please a Woman well;
And now the Truth to tell,
He thousands does excel,
For Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
Although near Sixty seven,
She makes as fair a figure,
Of one scarce twice eleven,
Few Woman being bigger;
And joyfully she does declare,
That she hopes to have a Son and Heir,
She having none before,
Though six above Threescore;
Thus we may see in Truth,
The sweet effects of Youth,
She had a Coultish-tooth,
And Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
Raising so sweet a Flower,
From such decays of Nature,
It shows a manly Power,
Of one that would not bait her
An ace of what is a Woman's due;
Such a brawny Lad you never knew,
Both Proper, Straight and Tall,
And lusty Limbs withal,
Oh, such a Man behold,
If he was to be sold,
He Is worth his weight in Gold,
Thus Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
When at the Lady's Table,
He as Servant waited,
She little though him able
To do what is reloted;
Yet when her Knight was laid in Grave,
None alive but William would she have;
She made him out of hand,
The Lord of all her Land;
Which kindness to requite,
He yields her the delight
And pleasant joys of night,
For Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
His Years is two and twenty,
The Lady's thrice as many,
Yet having Wealthy in plenty,
He loves her best of any,
And she likewise does him adore,
Having never any Child before;
And since the deed is done,
If it should prove a Son,
We shall great Triumph see;
For Lords of high Degree,
Will at the Christning be,
Since Will, has proved himself a Man of Skill.
