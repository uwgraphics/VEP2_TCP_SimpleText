THE PETITION OF THE East India Company.
To the Honorable the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, assembled in
Parliament. The humble Petition of the Governor and Company of Merchants of
London, Trading to the East Indies, in a General Court assembled.
Humbly Shows,
THAT your Petitioners and their Predecessors, upon the Encouragement of Queen
Elizabeth and succeeding Princes, by their several Royal Grants and Charters,
granted unto them exclusive, to all others have adventured their Estates, for
the discovering and carrying on a Traffic to those remote Parts; greatly to
the Advantage of the Navigation of this Kingdom, and to the Enriching of the
same, as well by what imported by them, as by the Exportation again of such
Commodities, for the carrying on a Foreign Trade to the Plantations; Spain,
Italy, Turkey, etc. And that your Petitioners have been informed, and did
always believe, that according to the Ancient Usage of their Predecessors, they
might legally manage their Trade, and Establish and Govern the Colonies, Forts,
and Garrisons of their Propriety, within the Limits of their Charters, by Virtue
of, and in conformity to, the several Grants and Charters from the Crown to
them and their Predecessors, from the first Establishment of the said Trade;
and that several Parliaments since that time, have had many occasions to take
notice of their said Charters, without any Disallowance thereunto, but on the
contrary, rather implicitly approved thereof: But your Petitioners have lately
received great damages and discouragements in their said Trade, by several
private Traders or Interlopers, who Originally were the Cause of all those
Troubles and Losses brought of late on the said Company.

Your Petitioners do therefore humbly represent to this Honorable House, That
the East India Trade cannot possibly be supported, but in a Joint Stock,
exclusive to all others, nor without such Powers granted unto them, equal to
that of their Neighbors; by which they uphold their Trade, and that while
Matters stands thus; the said East India Trade, and such other Foreign-Trades
from England as depends thereon, will not only suffer much; but other European
Nations will make great Advantage thereof, to the Hazard, if not the utter
Ruin and Loss of the English Commerce to those Parts.

Your Petitioners do therefore most humbly pray this-Honourable House will be
pleased to take the Premises into their most prudent considerations, and to
apply such seasonable Remedies for the Preservation of this great and important
Trade to the English Nation; and on which so many other Foreign Trades in a
great Measure depend, as to settle the same by Act of Parliament, under such
Methods or Regulations as this Honorable House shall think fit, unto which
your Petitioners shall at all times most humbly submit: And that in the mean
time your Petitioners may be supported and encouraged in preserving the said
Trade to the Nation in such manner, and by such means, as this Honorable House
in their great Wisdom shall think requisite.

And your Petitioners, shall ever pray, etc. JOSEPH HERNE, Governor.
