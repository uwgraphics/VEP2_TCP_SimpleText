Death's Uncontrollable Summons; OR, The Mortality of MANKIND.
Being a Dialogue between DEATH and a YOUNG MAN.
To the Tune of, My Bleeding Heart.




^N slumber and Sleep my senses failed,
hey ho, hey ho, then slept I;
^he bright Sun raised a mist withal,
(...) eclipsed in the darksome Sky.
^n ancient Father stood by me,
hey ho, hey ho, hollow eyes,
(...) foul deformed Wight was he
I thought my youth did him despite.
^is Cloak was green his head was gray,
hey ho, hey ho, silver hair,
His Face was pale as any clay
his Countenance made me much to fear.
Amazed at the sudden sight,
hey ho, hey ho, youthful boy;
I stood as one amazed quite,
hey ho, hey ho, dismal day,
Father, quoth I, tell me your name,
hey ho, hy ho, tell me true,
I pray you tell to me the same,
my joints do tremble at thy view
Young Youth, quoth he, I tell to thee
hey ho, hey ho, thy thread is spun;
My name is Death, I come for thee
hey ho, hey ho, thy Glass is run.
For me sweet Death I hope not so;
hey ho, hey ho, I am young;
Let me be old before I go,
alas! my time has not been long.
I have this worldly wealth at will,
hey ho, hey ho, ask and have,
Let me enjoy those Pleasures still,
oh my Soul abhors the Grave.
I scorn thy Treasure and thy Pelf,
hey ho, hey ho, haste away,
Thy goods shall perish with thy self,
it is not thy Wealth, my stroke shall stay.
Oh Death! what will my true Love say?
hey ho, hey ho, she will complain
On thee, for taking me away;
sweet Death with her let me remain.
I tell thee yet, thou strivest in vain,
hey ho, hey ho, go it is time;
Thy vital thread is cut in twain,
oh hark and hear the dulsome Chyme.
Then woe is me! I must be gone,
hey ho, hey ho, my heart,
My Worlds delight and all is gone,
there was never man so loath to parts.
Mark well my Fall you youthful Buds;
hey ho, hey ho, view my Fall,
My Pleasures, Plenty Life and Goods,
hey ho, hey ho, Death ends all.
