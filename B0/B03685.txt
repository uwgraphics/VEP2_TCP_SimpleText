Hope farewell, Adieu to all pleasure, OR Silvia's Matchless Cruelty.
To the Tune of, Hail great Sir, etc.
HOPE farewell, adieu to all Pleasure,
No Torment so great as Love in despair:
Sylvia frowns, my Endeavors to please her,
And laughs at those pains she makes me to bear.
Life's my disease, and there is no Cure,
But death's cruel dart that must set me at ease;
But when I Am no more, O then may she grieve,
For him, who while living, she would never relieve.
In the World so charming a Creature
(my Fancy tells me) I never beheld;
Splendid Grace is Love in each Feature,
That which Loves Raptures I strangely am filled:
Here I ly slain with darts of Disdain,
While Sylvia's hard heart will not pity my pain:
But let her know, for all her great hate,
That she may repent it when it is too late.
Can you be so desperate cruel,
As, for your sake to let death (...) my doom?
Love is like unquenchible Feuel,
In which all my Glory and Life will consume:
Still you despise my sorrowful cries,
And over your Lover does here tyrannize;
But when kind Death shall once set me free,
You may be Rewarded for your Cruelty.
When the World shall read this sad Story,
Which here I write with a trembling Quill,
Showing how you have blasted my Glory,
Oh! will they not count you a Tyrant still?
Then let me find my Silvia more kind,
To comfort and cherish my troubled mind.
For if I go to the Shades below,
It Is you are the Causer of my Overthrow.
Oh! my Grief is never lamented,
By she whom I so dearly adore:
With her Frowns I am daily tormented:
No Creature for Love e're suffered more:
Cupid's keen dart has wounded her heart,
I never, no never did feel greater smart:
Here a poor slave one smile he does crave,
Or else you will send him to his silent Grave.
In your Charms I daily delighted,
And never thought you my Heaven to be:
Yet by you I am evermore slighted,
And now you make a poor Martyr of me.
Wont you therefore your Captive restore,
Who sues for your Love, and desires no more?
You may be su^e what Pains I endure,
And it is in your power either to kill or cure.
In a sad and sorrowful Ditty,
With sighs and tears I send forth my moan;
Yet my fair one affoords me no pity,
But lets me languish to death all alone:
This very day now I must away,
Both heart and spirit with Life does decay.
More than Untrue, dear Sylvia was you,
And therefore farewell, all the World adieu.
