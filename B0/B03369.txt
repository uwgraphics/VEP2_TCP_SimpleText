The Fox Vnkennel'd; OR, The Whiggs IDOL.
By a Young Nobleman of the University of OXFORD.
IF Men are deemed for Loyalty
As Traitors to their Prince,
No wonder if Impiety
Should gain Pre-eminence.
When those of Merit are displaced,
And worthless Wretches rise,
Virtue will soon be in Disgrace,
And Vice assume the Prize.
Great ORMOND who of late did shine
Like Sol in this our Sphere,
Seems now eclipsed for a Time,
To shine again more clear.
These Earth-born Sons may Interpose,
And Cloud this Orb awhile,
But Heaven will all the Cheat disclose,
And on this Planet smile.
ORMOND who no Addition wants,
To make his Soul complete,
Will Not basely cringe for further Grants,
To make himself less Great.
Poor Minds may stoop to Things that is base,
But this Heroic Soul
Derives his Greatness from his Race,
Trained up in Honor's School.
He always fought with a Design
To do his Country Right,
His Sovereign would not undermine,
To heap up Millions by it.
His Prince's Councils never betrayed,
To please a Dalela
Nor others Provinces invade,
To rise by Infamy.
He never Voted for a Bill,
to please ^he Populace,
Bring forty Votes against it still,
Because it should not pass.
No B -- r T -- y ever made,
To magnify the Dutch,
And ^u^n his own Countr^'s Trade,
That carres^'d him so much.
Nor ever ^e^ did go about,
Or send his haughty Wife
To Closet Members for to Vote
Him General for Life.
He never opposed Her Majesty,
Whose Right it was to fill
A Regimental Vacancy,
When She declared for Hill.
No base Deductions ever made
From Foreign Troops Abroad,
Nor fed upon his Soldiers Bread,
Such Baseness he abhorred.
Never robbed a General of his Right,
His Honor, or his Fame,
To load a fawning Parasite,
That could not act the same.
Contingent Moneys he applies
Unto its proper Uses,
Not let the French for want of Spies
Decamp, then form Excuses.
No Foreign Banks his ill-got Wealth
Their Credit does maintain,
Nor sneak Abroad to screen himself,
And save his sinking Fame.
Ingratitude never filled his Breast,
Nor found an Entrance there,
Never robbed his Monarch of her Rest,
In hopes to fill the Chair.
No vile tumultuous Monsters bent
To show their Rage and Spleen,
Made up of Nature's Sedement,
Were led in Pomp by him.
To trample on that Royal Dust
Which made him what he is,
Nor ever betrayed his Nation's Trust,
To raise its Enemies.
No Righteous Judges ever displaced,
^o gratify his Pride,
For Voting once against His Grace,
Must now be laid aside.
Let Souls depraved thus grasp the Air,
The empty Bubble prize,
ORMOND moves in a nobler Sphere,
His Actions reach the Skie^.
London, Printed by J. Benson in the Strand.
