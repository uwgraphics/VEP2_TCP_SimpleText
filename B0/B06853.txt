The new Irish Christmas Box OR, THE Female Dear Joy tricked out of her Maiden
Head.
To an Excellent new Teagueland Tune.
1.
AS I went to Mondeer,
With my Barrel of Beer,
There I met with young Peggy
Whose Beauty was Clear;
Sing ratting a roo,
Ratting a roo-re-roo, re-roo-re-roo,
Ratting a roo-re-roo, re-roo-re-roo,
Far to rance,
Sing far-re-a-roo-rance,
Sing hay-bou bance,
Sing ratting a roo.
2.
Says he my dear Peggy,
If with me you will go,
A Bottle of Clarret
On thee I Will bestow,
sing ratting a roo, etc.
3.
I Will give the fine Rigging,
And Top-knots to wear,
And a pair of new Gloves,
at Notingham Fair
Sing ratting a roo, etc.
4.
I tip't her the Wink
And backwards she fell,
And Twenty Weeks after,
Her Belly did swell
Sing rartting a roo, etc.
5.
When Twenty Weeks after,
she sat down and Cried
Oh! this have I gotten,
By being thus tried,
sing ratting a roo etc.
6.
Oh stay my dear Peggy,
and be not unkind,
For we will be Married,
When the Devil is Blind,
Sing ratting a roo!
Ratting a roo-re-roo, re-roo-re-roo,
ratting a roo-re-roo, re-roo-re-roo,
Far roo rance,
sing far-re-a-roo-rance,
sing ha-bou bance,
sing ratting a roo.
