The Deplorable CASE of the poor People in the Mint, humbly Offered to the
Charitable Consideration of the Honorable, the Commons of Great Britain in
Parliament Assembled.
THat through the Decay of Trade, and other great Losses, during the late and
present War; as also through the Excessive Crowd of Foreigners, who have
encroach'd on them in their respective Callings, have thereby failed: and to
avoid perrishing in Prison, were forced to run into the Mint for shelter, where
many of them lie on the Ground in a starving Condition for want of House-room,
which makes their Condition as miserable as those of the Common side in Newgate.

And whereas it is supposed, that Men of Substance come into the Mint, with a
Design to Defraud their Creditors, which throw's an Odium on the poorer sort,
who Abhor such unjustifiable practices, and are willing to submit their
Conditions to the strictest Examination.

That by Relieving such, the Men of Substance will be exposed to the power of
the Law. And if thought fit, a Clause may be inserted, wherein it shall be
Praemunire in any Man to Resist a Legal Process.

Wherefore they most humbly refer their unheard of Misery and Distress to this
August Assembly as your Own poor Natives, and most humbly Pray, that out of
your Charitable Goodness, you will please to allow them the full benefit of the
Act for Relief of Insolvent Debtours in as ample a manor as if Actually
Prisoners in the several Goales in and about the Cities of London and
Westminster.

And they shall ever Pray, etc.
THE CASE Of the poor People in the Mint.
