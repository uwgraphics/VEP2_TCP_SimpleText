An ENCOMIASTICK EPIGRAM Upon the most ANCIENT and HONORABLE TRADE OF MASONS.
By Mr. WILLIAM GEDDES, Late Minister at Vrquhart.
AMong Mechanics, MASONS I extol,
And with the best I doubt not to Enroll.
Before the Flood Antiquity and Noble Precedents.
Antiquity they Claim,
The MASON then must have an ancient Name.
When Godly Josephus de Antiq. Jud. Jude Epist.
Enoch by his Divine Art,
He did foretell how that the World should smart
By Fire and Water, he two Pillars made,
The one with Brick, and one with Stone was laid:
He wrote thereon all Sciences and Arts,
Some knowledge to Diffuse in all Men's hearts.
If Water came, the Stone might it endure;
The Brick the Fire; so all continued sure.
The Exodus 32.
Moral-Law, in writ none could it have,
Till GOD Himself in Stone he must it Grave.
For Hewing Stone, none can put you to shame,
Honorable and mysterious Badge.
The Cornerstone, to JESUS is a Name:
For this I think the MASON must be Blessed,
From ancient times he has a Divine A Metaphore taken from a part of the Coat
of Arms.
Crest.
A Character whereby they know each other,
And yet so Secret, none knows but a Brother.
All Temples, Turrets, Noble and Stately Works.
Palaces of Kings,
All Castles, Steeples, and such other things:
Strong Holds and Houses, which do long endure,
Do owe all what they have to MASONS CURE.
All Courts great Grandeur, and Magnifick State,
What Pomp they have, from MASONS they do get;
The strictest Laws they have for Laws and Order.
Common-well,
The greatest Charity when BRETHREN fail.
Symbols Divine, The Sum of all.
Pomp, Dwelling, Law and Love;
Few are the Men who do such Tradsmen prove.
