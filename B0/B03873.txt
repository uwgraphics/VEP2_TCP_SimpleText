the Advantages of Trade Requiring, That the Customs and Subsidies of Tonnage

Imported, Be Continued to be Collected as in the time of Our dearest Brother
lately Deceased We do therefore by and with the Advice of Our Privy Council
Require, And Our Will and Pleasure is, That the said Duties be Collected
accordingly, by all and singular the Officers and Collectors within all and
every Our Ports in any of Our Dominions, not doubting of a ready Compliance
