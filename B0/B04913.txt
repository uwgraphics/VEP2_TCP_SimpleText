A Particular Account of the Late Great Engagement In the North of IRELAND,
With the Total Defeat of the IRISH, and after the Killing 6000 of the Irish on
the Place, the taking their Baggage and Ammunition, and the Scots and English
remaining Masters of the Fields.
BY a Ship arrived from Drogheda to Leverpoole, we have this Advice certainly
confirmed, Tyrconnell having according to his Resolutions in Council, sent an
Army of Twenty Two Thousand Men, whereof the one half were Horse, to Suppress
with all Expedition the Protestants then and now in Arms in the North, the
Scots having early notice of their Resolutions and Motions, were resolved to
Advance, and Divert their Enemies as far from their own Habitations and
Country as they could, boldly drew together about Nine or Ten Thousand Men,
and Marched as far as H^y^elsburgh, in the County of Down, where they first
lighting on the Forlorn-Hope of the Irish, with abundance of Resolution and
Courage, they Attacked them, and though they were composed of the flower of
Tyrconnell's Army, they with the first Onset Routed, and put them to flight,
with such Confusion, that they run upon their own Foot, who were advancing, and
very much disordered them, when by this time the English coming upon them,
occasioned a very brisk Dispute, being almost twice the Number, came on first
with all seeming Resolution, and being Encouraged by their Officers, who were
continually buzzing their Religion, Loyalty, and the smallness of their Enemies
numbers; they stood the first Brunt pretty boldly; but the English who knew
their Lives and Fortunes depended almost on their present performance, at least
being the first trial, it should so encourage the Irish, and dishearten the
Protestants, that it might much threaten their Total Ruin, they pressed with such
Vigor on them, that they were no longer able to endure, but with all
Expedition Retreating, many of them threw down their Arms, and left the English
total Masters of the Field. The Number of the Slain, considering the inequality
of the Forces, were vastly advantageous on the English side, for of the Irish
were Slain Six Thousand Three Hundred, besides many Prisoners, and some of them
Officers; of the Scots and English not quite Four Thousand, and those not near
so well Armed as the Irish. This first Success has very much enlivened the poor
Protestants, and disheartened the Irish; who begin to apprehend what
Disadvantages they ly under, when so small a Number, so ill Armed, were able to
Defeat the most select part of their whole Army, and do very much Dread the
approach of the English Forces, who with all Expedition, (some being already on
Board) are to be sent to the Relief of the poor Protestants, and total, (as we
hope) Suppression of those Rebellious Miscreants.
