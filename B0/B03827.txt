The Prodigals Resolution
OR, My Father was Born before me.
To a Pleasant Mew Tune.




I Am a lusty lively Lad,
new come to one and twenty,
My Father left me all he had,
both Gold and Silver plenty;
Now he is in Grave, I will be brave,
the Ladies shall adore me,
I Will court and kiss, what hurt's in this,
My Dad did so before me.
My Father was thirfty Sir,
till Soul and body sund'ed
Some say he was a Usurer,
for thirty in the hundred;
He scrapt and scratcht, ^he pincht and patched
that in her helly bore me;
But i will let fly, a good cause why,
My Father was born before me.
My Daddy had his Duty done,
in getting so much treasure,
I Will be as dutiful a Son,
for spending it in pleasure:
Five pounds a quart, shall cheer my heart,
such Necture will restore me,
When Ladies call, I Will have at all,
My Father was born before me.
My Grandam lived at Washington,
my Grandsir delv'd in Ditches,
The Son of Old John Thrashington,
whose lanthorn leathern Breeches:
Cried, whither go ye, whither go ye,
though men do now adore me
They never did see my Pedigree,
Nor who was born before me.




MY grandsir strived, and wiv'd, and thrived,
till he did Riches gather,
And when he had much wealth achieved,
O then he got my Father:
Of happy memmory cry I,
that e're his Mother bore him,
I had not been worth one penny,
Had I been born before him.
To Free School, Cambridge, and Gray's Inn'
my Grey-coat Grandsir put him,
Till to forget (he did begin)
the Leathern Breech that got him:
One dealt in Straw, 'tother in Law,
the one did Ditch and Delve it,
My Father store of Satin wore,
My Grandsir Beggars Velvet.
So get I wealth, what care I if
my Grandsir were a Sawyer,
My Father proved to be a chief
subtle and Learned Lawyer,
By Cooks Reports, and tricks-in-Court,
he did with Treasure store me,
That I may say, Heavens bless the day,
My Father was born before me.
Some say, of late, a Merchant that
had gotten store of Riches,
In's Drininkn-room hung up his Hat,
his staff, and Leathern Breeches;
His stockings garter'd up with straws,
e're Providence did store him,
His Son was Sheriff of London, 'cause
His Father was born before him.
So many blades that Rant in silk,
and put on Scarlet clothing,
At first did spring from Butter-milk,
their Ancestors worth nothing:
Old Adam, and our Grandam Eve,
by digging and by spinning,
Did to all Kings and Princes give
Their Radical beginning.
My Father to get me estate,
though selfish yet was slavish,
I Will spend it at another rate,
and be as lewdly lavish:
From Madmen, Fools, and knaves he did
litigiously receive it,
If so he did, Justice forbid,
But I to such should leave it.
At Play Houses and Tennis-Court,
I Will prove a noble Fellow,
I Will Court my Doxies to the sport,
of O! brave Punchinello:
I Will Dice and Drab, and Drink and Stab,
no Hector shall out-roar me,
If Teachers tell we tales of Hell,
My Father is gone before me.
Our aged Counselors would have
us live by Rule and Reason,
'Cause they are marching to the Grave,
and pleasures out of season:
I Will learn to Dance the Mode of France,
that Ladies may adore me,
My thrifty Dad no pleasure had,
Though he was born before me.
I Will to the Court where Venus sport,
does Revel it in plenty,
I Will deal with all, both great and small,
from twelve to five and twenty:
In Play Houses i will spend my days,
for they are hung round with Plackets,
Ladies make room, behold I come,
Have at your KNOCKING Jackest*
