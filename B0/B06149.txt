To the Right Honorable the Lords and Commons, Assembled in Parliament.
The Humble Petition of many Poor Distressed Sea-mens Wives, and Widows.
Most Humbly Shows,
THat whereas there being Arrears of Wages due to your poor Petitioners, for
Service done in his MAJESTY'S Ships, (...) the Year (1658.) the want thereof,
has exposed your Petitioners, together with their Families, to great Wants and
Miseries; and so weakened their Credits with poor Tradesmen; namely, Chandlers,
Bakers, Butchers, and the like, that usually Credit them with Provisions of
Victuals in the absence of their Husbands; that your poor Petitioners with
their Families are in danger of perishing, and are in great want, and are daily
imprisoned; and others for non-payment of their Rent, turned out of their
Habitations, with their Wives and Families.

In tender Consideration of the Premises, May it gracious;ly please these
Honorable Houses of Peers and Commons, now in the High Court of Parliament
Assembled, to take the Premises into your Serious and Pious Considerations,
and to take such Order for satisfying their Arrears of Wages, that so your Poor
Petitioners may thereby be enabled to satisfy those poor Tradesmen that have
entrusted them with Food: And for the Future to keep them and their poor
Families from Starving, and Perishing: All which we humbly beg, and wholly
refer to your Honors Grave Wisdoms, and Pious Considerations.

And we, as in Duty bound, shall ever pray, etc.
