Loves Boundless Power OR, The Charmed Lovers Happiness Completed.
Being a most Excellent New Play-Song, most Pleasant and Delightful.
Doranus s^ies the Charming Nymph, whose Power
Wounds more then hers, who in a sudden Shower,
Brought Thunder-bearing Jove from lofty Skies,
To pay Devotion to her Stary Eyes:
He Is Conquered, and entreats, to which she yields
Phillis the Glory, both of Woods and Fields:
Does condesend to Love, and Crown his Wish,
With Joys transending any Mortal Bliss.
To the Tune of, When Busy Fame, etc.




HAil to the Myrtle Shade,
all hail to the Nymphs of the field
Kings will not here Invade,
though Virtue all freedom yields:
Beauty here opens her arms,
to soften the Languishing mind,
And Phillis unlocks her Charms,
ah! Phillis so fair and unkind.
Phillis the Soul of Love,
the joy of the neighboring Swains,
Phillis that Crowns the Grove,
and does guide the flowring Plains:
Phillis who never had skill
to Paint, or to Patch or be fine,
Yet Phillis whose eyes can kill,
that Nature has made Divine.




Phillis whose Charming tongue,
makes labor and pain delight,
Phillis that makes the day long,
and shortens the livelong night.
Phillis whose Lips like May,
still laughs on those sweets they bring
Whose love never knew decay,
but thence flows Eternal Spring.
Her eyes like Stars appear,
from her Angel-face they shine,
As Phoebus in his Sphere
they dazel this Soul of mine;
Whilst Rosy Cheeks o're-spread;
with fragrant and rich Perfume,
There Cupid makes his Bed,
where choice pleasures ever bloom.
And pleasant Nectar Sips,
oh! where joys for ever grow,
Eke from her Corral Lips,
enclosing Pearls as white as Snow.
So Ravishing and fair,
no Mortal ever yet viewed,
Transports beyond compare,
which Caesar would have subdued.
And force from him his Arms,
whilst he his great Conquest yields,
And bows to Phillis Charms,
triumphs of his Conquered Fields:
Laying his G^eatness down,
even at her Virgins feet,
In Romes Imperial Crown,
my bright Phillis Love to meet.
Or Alexander whom
the proud Eastern world obeyed.
Might here have sought a Room,
and in his Conquests said:
What joys seized when by the Spring,
oh! I first beheld her face,
Such as bright Angels bring
to the Dying Saints apace.
I lowly bowed to earth,
and kiss the humble ground,
Telling her of my Birth,
I and of my fatal Wound:
She smiled upon me then,
and sighing, alas poor Swain,
So smiled and sighed again,
and straight bid me not complain.
Then in her Ivory Arms,
she raised me softly, crying,
Alas! what can my Charms
so powerful prove in trying:
My Doranus to destroy,
then I leaning on her breast,
And whilst she called me joy,
I with trembling Lips them pressed.
At which she laid her down
amongst the Lillies fair,
And there my Love did Crown,
with joys far beyond compare;
Such Heavenly transports none
upon earth could ever yield,
Except Phillis alone,
who Charms the Woods and Field,
Printed for I. Deacon, at the Angel in Guiltspur-Street.
