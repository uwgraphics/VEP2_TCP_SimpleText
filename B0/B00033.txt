A godly Exhortation, necessary for this present time.
LEt not the dull and sluggish sleep
close up thy waking eye,
Until aright with judgment deep,
thy daily deeds thou try.
He which one sin in conscience keeps,
when he to quiet goes,
More ventrous is, then he that sleeps
with twenty mortal foes.
Therefore at night call unto mind,
how thou the day have spent:
Praise God, if naught amiss thou find;
if ought, betime repent.
And sinc^ ^hy bed a pattern is
of death and fatal hearse,
Toward bed it shall not be amiss,
Thus to record in verse:
My bed is like the grave so cold;
and sleep, which shuts mine eye,
Resembles death: clothes, which me fold,
declare the mould so dry.
The biting Fleas resemble well
the wrinckling worms to be,
Which with me in the grave shall dwell,
where I no light shall see.
The nightly bell, which I hear towle,
as I am laid in bed,
Declares, the bell shall for me knowle
and ring, when I am dead.
The rising in the morn likewise,
when sleepie night is past,
Puts me in mind, how I shall rise
to Judgment at the last.
I go to bed as to my grave:
God knows when I shall wake:
But (Lord) I trust, thou will me save,
and me to mercy take.
FINIS.

Smithfield. 1603.
