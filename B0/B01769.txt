The Breech Washed By a Friend to the RUMP.
IN an humor of late I was
Ycleped a doleful dump.
Thought I -- we are at a fine pass;
Not a man stands up for the Rump:
But lets it be lashed o'r and o'r.
While it lies like a senseless Fop --.
'T would make a man, a Whore,
To see a Tail tew'd like a Top.
Though a Rump be a dangerous Bit,
And many a Knave runs mad ont't,
Yet verily as it may hit,
An honest man may be glad on it.
To abuse a poor, Blind Creature --
I had like to have said, and a Dumb;
But now it has gotten a Speaker,
And Say is the Mouth of the Bum,
When Besse ruled the Land there was no man
Complained, and yet now they Rail:
I beseech you what differs a woman
(...) From a thing that is all Tongue, and Tail?
Though a Rump, etc.
The Charter we have sworn to defend,
And propagate the Cause.
What call you those of the Rump-end
But Fundamental Laws?
The Case is as clear as the Day,
There had been no Reformation,
If the Rump had not clawed it away,
You had had no Propagation,
Though a Rump, etc.
As a Body's the better for a Purge,
Though the Guts may be troubled with Grip^s:
So the Nation will mend with a Scourge,
Though the Tail may be sick of the Stripes.
Ill Humors to conve^gh,
When the State has taken a Loosnesse,^
(Who can hold what will away?)
The Rump must do the Business.
Though a Rump, etc.
The bold Cavalier, in the Field,
That laughs at your Sword, and Gunshot,
An Ordinance makes him to yield,
And he is glad to turn Tail to Bum-shot.
Old Oliver was a Teazer,
And waged war with the Stump;
But Alexander, and Caesar
Did both submit to the Rump.
Though a Rump, etc.
Let no man be further misled
By an Error, past Debate.
For Sedgwick has proved it the Head,
At well of the Church as the State;
onest Hugh; that still turns up the Tippets,
When he Kneels to Administer;
Says -- a Rump, with Skippons sippets,
Is a Dish for a Holy Sister,
Though a Rump, etc.
Through Pr^de of Flesh, or State
Poor Souls are overthrown:
How happy then is our Fate?
Wee've a Rump to take us down,
In matter's of (...) it is true,
^ Some Differings (...) may
But give the Saints their due,
In the Rump they all agree.
Though a Rump, etc.
It Is good at Bed, and at Board;
It gives us Pleasure and Ease,
Will you have the rest in a word?
It Is good for the new disease,
(The Tumult of the Guts;)
It Is a Recipe for the Kings Evil,
Wash the Members as sweet as Nuts,
And then throw them all to the Devil.
Though a Rump be a dangerous Bit,
And many a Knave runs mad on it,
Yet, verily, as it may hit,
An honest man may be glad on it.
Printed at Oxford for Carolus Gustavus.
