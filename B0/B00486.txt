The Country Less.
To a dainty new Note, which if you can hit,
There Is another tune will as well fit.
To the tune of, The mother beguild daughter.


ALthough I am a Country Less,
a lofty mind I bear a,
I think my self as good as those
that gay apparel wear a:
My coat is made of comely Gray,
yet is my skin as soft a,
As those that with the chiefest Wines,
do bathe their bodies often a.
Down, down dery, dery down,
heigh down a down a down a,
a dery dery dery dery down,
heigh down a down a dery.
What though I keep my Fathers sheep,
a thing that must be done a,
A garland of the fairest flowers
shall shrewd me from the Sun a:
And when I see them feeding be,
where grass and flowers spring a
Close by a Crystal fountain side
I sit me down, and sing a,
Down etc.
Dame nature crowns us with delight,
surpassing Court or City,
We pleasures take from morn to night
in Sports and pastimes pretty:
Your City Dames in Coaches ride
abroad for recreation,
We Country Lasses hate their pride,
and keep the Country fashion.
Down etc.
Your City Wives lead wanton lives,
and if they come in the Country,
They are so proud, that each one strives
for to outbraue our Gentry
We country lasses homely be
for seat nor wall we strive not,
We are content with our degree,
our debtors we deprive not,
Down etc.
I care not for the fane or Mask,
when Titans heat reflecteth,
A homely Hat is all I ask,
which well my face protecteth:
Yet am I in my Country guise,
esteemed Less as pretty
As those that every day devise
new shapes in Court or City.
Down etc.
In every season of the year
I undergo my labor
No Shower nor Wind at all I fear,
my Limbs I do not favor:
If Summers heat my beauty stain,
it makes me nere the sicker,
Since I can wash it off again
with a Cup of Christmas Liquor.
Down, down dery, dery down,
heigh down a down a down a,
a dery dery dery dery down,
heigh down a down a dery.
The second part.
To the same tune,


AT Christmas time in mirth and glee,
I dance with young men neatly,
And who in the City like to me,
shall surely taste compleately:
No Sport, but Pride and Luxury
in the city can be found then,
But bounteous Hospitality
in the Country does abound then,
Down etc.
In The Spring my labor yields delight,
to walk in the merry Morning,
When Flora is (to please my sight)
the ground with flowers adorning:
With merry Lads to make the Hay
I go, and do not grumble,
My work does seem to be but play,
when with young men I tumble.
Down etc.
The Lark and Thrush from Bryar to Bush
do leap, and skip, and sing a,
And all this then to welcome in
the long-and looked for Spring a*
We fear not Cupids arrows keen,
Dame Venus we defy a,
Diana is our honored Queen,
and her we magnify a.
Down etc.
That which your City-Damsels scorn,
we hold our chiefest Jewel,
Without, to work at Hay and Corn,
within to Bake and Brew well,
To keep the Dayrie decently,
and all things clean and neatly,
Your Citie-Minions do defy,
their scorn we weigh not greatly.
Down etc.
When we together a milking go,
with pailes upon our heads a,
And walking over Woods and Fields,
where Grass and Flowers spreds a,
In honest pleasure we delight,
which makes our labor sweet a,
And Mirth exceeds on every side,
when Lads and Lasses meet a.
Down etc.
Then do not scorn a Country Less,
though she be plain and meanly:
Who takes the Country Wench to Wife,
(that goes neat and cleanely)
Is better sped, then if he wed
a fine one from the City,
For then they are so nicely bred,
they must not work for pity.
Down etc.
I speak not this to that intent,
(as some may well conjecture)
As though to Wooing I were bent,
nor I nere learned Lovers Lectuue:
But what I sing is in defense
of all plain Country Lasses,
Whose modest honest innocence
all City Girls surpasses.
Down, down dery, dery down, etc.
FINIS.
