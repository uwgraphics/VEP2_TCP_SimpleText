ACADEMIA OXONIENSIS
SAPIENTIAE* ET FELICITATIS. blazon of Oxford University
WALTER BLANDFORD, Doctor in Divinity, and Vice Chancellor of the University
of Oxford,
to all Persons, whom it may concern, Greeting.
Whereas all Vndergraduates, and Minors whatsoever, are strictly accomptable in
all their matters of Bargain, and expense, to their respective Tutors, and
Governors, and ought not by the Laws, and Ancient Usages of this Place to be
Trusted, or Dealt with for any Sum, or Thing exceeding Five Shillings in
Value, without the approbation of the said Tutors and Governors: And that
notwithstanding, several Persons have of late presumed to Trust, and Deal with
Young Scholars for very great Values, to the utter debauching of many of them,
and the unsufferable affront to public Discipline. These are straightly to
Charge and Require all manner of Persons, as Mercers, Booksellers, and all
others, Privileged, or not Privileged, of what Quality, Trade, or Occupation,
soever, that from the day of the Date hereof, they do not Buy, Sell, Trust, or
Bargain with any Undergraduate, or Minor whatsoever, that has his Residence,
or Name in any College, or Hall, within this University, for any Sum, or
Thing above the said Value of Five Shillings, without the knowledge, and
express approbation of his Tutor, or Governor respectively, under the pain of
being proceeded against (by Dispriviledging, Discommoning, Imprisonment, etc.
according to the Quality of the Person, and Nature of the Offense) as a
Perturber of the Peace, and Good Government of this Place.

We likewise further require and command all such as have trusted, or dealt
with Undergraduates, without the knowledge of their respective Tutors, beyond
the Value of Five Shillings aforesaid, that they bring in true Bills of all
such Credits and Demands as are yet unpaid them, to the respective Tutors, or
Governors concerned, at, or before the Twentieth Day of February next after
the Date hereof, under the Pains and Penalties aforesaid, to be Inflicted upon
all such as shall neglect, or refuse.

Given under the Seal of the Office of the Chancellor-ship of the University of
Oxford the Twenty Sixth Day of January, in the Year of our Lord, 1663.
