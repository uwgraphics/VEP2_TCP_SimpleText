A True CHARACTER OF Sundry Trades and Callings: OR, A New ditty of Innocent
Mirth.
This Song is New, and perfect True,
there is none can this deny;
For I am known, Friend, to be one
that scorns to tell a Lie.
To the Tune of, Old Simon the KING.
This may be Printed,

R. P.









Now Gentlemen sit you all merry,
I Will sing you a Song of a Want,
Til make you as merry as may be,
though Moneys begin to grow scant:
A Woman without e're a Tongue,
she never can scold very fond;
It Is just such another great Want,
when the Fiddler wants his Crowd:
Good People I tell unto you,
these Lines they are absolute new,
For I hate and despise the telling of Lies,
this Ditty is merry and true.
A Ship that is without e're a Sail,
may be driven the Lord knows whither;
It Is just such another sad Want,
as the Shoemaker wants his Leather:
A Man that has got but one Leg,
will make but a pitiful Runner,
And he that has no Eyes in his Head,
will make but a sorrowful Gunner:
Good People I tell unto you,
these Lines they are absolute new,
For I hate and despise the telling of Lies,
this Ditty is merry and true.
A Doctor without any Stomach,
will make but a pittyful Dinner,
And he that has got no Victuals to eat,
will quickly look thinner and thinner:
A Bell without tever a Clapper,
will make but sorrowful Sound,
And he that has no Land of his own,
may work on another Man's Ground:
Good People I tell unto you,
these lines they are absolute new,
For I hate and despise the telling of Lies,
this Ditty is merry and true.
A Blacksmith without his Bellows,
he need not to rise very soon,
And he that has no Clothes to put on,
may lie in his Bed till noon:
An Innkeeper without any Custom,
will never get store of Wealth,
And if he has never a Sign to hang up,
he may e'ne go hang up himself:
Good people, etc.
A Miller without any Stones,
he is but a sorrowful Soul,
And if that he has no Corn to grind,
he need not stand taking of Toll:
The Tailor we know he is loath
to take any Cabbidge at all,
If he has no Silk, Stuff or Cloth,
to do that good Office withal.
Good People, etc.
A Woman without e're a Fault,
she like a bright Star will appear;
But a Brewer without any Malt,
will make but pitiful Beer:
A Man that has got but one Shirt,
when e're it is washed for his hide,
I hope it cannot be no great hurt,
to lie in his Bed till it is dried,
Good People, etc.
A Mountebank without his Fools,
and a Skip-kennel turned out of Place,
A Tinker without any Tools,
they are all in a sorrowful case:
You know that a Dish of good Meat,
it is the true Stay of Man's Life,
But he that has nothing to eat,
he need not to draw out his Knife.
Good People, etc.
A Peddler without e're a Stock,
it makes him look pitiful blew;
A Shepherd without ever a Flock;
has little or nothing to do:
A Farmer without any Corn,
he neither can give, sell or lend;
A Huntsman without ever a Horn,
his Wife she must stand his good Friend,
Good People, etc.
A Plowman that has never a Plow,
I think may live at his ease;
A Dairy without e're a Cow,
will make but had Butter and Cheese*
A Man that is pitiful poor,
has little or nothing to loose;
And he that has never a Foot,
it saves him the buying of Shoes.
Good People, etc.
A Warren without ever a Coney,
is barren, and so much the worse;
And he that is qute without Money,
can have no great need of a Purse.
I hope there is none is this place,
that now is dispaleas'd with his Song,
Come buy up my Ballads apace,
and i will pack up my awls and be gone.
Good People I tell unto you,
these Lines they are absolute new,
For I hate and despise the telling of Lies,
this Ditty is merry and true.
Printed for P. Brooksby, at the Golden Ball in Pye-Corner.
