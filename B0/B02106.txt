to depart from the Cities of London and Westminster, and all other Places

CHARLES R.

WHereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in Parliament Assembled,
having taken into their serious Consideration the Bloody and Traitorous Designs
of Popish Recusants against His Majesty's Sacred Person and Government, and the
Protestant Religion, have (for prevention thereof) most humbly besought His
Majesty to issue forth His Royal Proclamation, to the effect, and for the
purposes hereafter mentioned: The Kings most Excellent Majesty has been
Graciously pleased readily to condescend thereunto; And does by this His Royal
Proclamation straightly Charge and Command all persons being Popish Recusants, or
so reputed, that they do on or before the Seventh day of November next ensuing
(under pain of His Majesty's highest Displeasure, and of the severest Execution
of the Laws against them) depart and retire themselves and their Families from
His Majesty's Royal Palaces of Whitehall, Somerset House, and St. James, the
Cities of London and Westminster, and from all other Places within Ten miles
distance of the same: And that no Person being a Popish Recusant, or so
reputed, do presume at any time hereafter to repair or return to His Majesty's
said Palaces, or any of them, or to the said Cities, or either of them, or
within Ten miles of the same.

Provided, That nothing before contained, shall extend to such Householders
dwelling within the said Cities, or either of them, or in any Place within Ten
miles of the same, who being Traders; exercising some Trade or Manual
Occupation, have been there settled for the space of Twelve Months last past,
in Houses of their Own, and have not an Habitation elsewhere, and who shall
give in their Names, and the Names of all other Persons in their Families, to
the two next Justices of the Peace. And His Majesty does strictly Charge and
Command, That immediately after the said Seventh day of November, the
Constables, Churchwardens, and other Parish Officers within the said Cities,
and either of them, and within Ten miles of the same, do go from House to House
in their several Parishes, Hamlets, Constabularies, and Divisions respectively,
and there take an Account of the Names and Surnames of all such Persons as are
Popish Recusants, or reputed so to be, as well Householders as Lodgers, or
Servants, and to carry a List of their Names to the two next Justices of the
Peace, who are hereby Required and Enjoined to send for them, and every of
them, and to tender to them and every of them, the Oaths of Allegiance and
Supremacy, and to commit to Prison till the next succeeding Sessions of the
Peace, all such Persons as shall refuse the said Oaths, and at the said next
Sessions to proceed against them according to Law: His Majesty hereby giving
the said Justices to understand, That the better to enable them to tender the
said Oaths, His Majesty has Commanded respective Commissions to be issued
under His Great Seal of England, to the Justices of Peace within the said
Cities of London and Westminster, and the Places within Ten miles of the same,
to Authorize and Require them, or any two of them respectively, to administer
the said Oaths accordingly.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the Thirtieth day of October, 1678. in the
Thirtieth year of Our Reign.
