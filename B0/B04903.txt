The Coy Shepherdess OR, Phillis and Amyntas.
Fair Phillis in a wanton posture lies
Not thinking to be seen by mortal eyes
Till accidentally, Amyntas came,
And see her lie, which made her blush for shame
He cast himself down by her on the Hay
And won her love, before he went away.
Tune of, Phillis on the new made Hay, or, Amarillis.


PHillis on the new made hay
On a pleasant Summers day,
She in a wanton posture lay
thinking no Shephard nigh her
Till Amyntas came that way
and threw himself down by her.
At the first she was amazed
And with blushes on him gazed
Her beau^y bright, did him invite
her shape he did admire.
Her wanton dress, could do no lose,
then set his heart on fire.
Then Amyntas mildly said
Phillis be not now afraid
But entertain, thy shepherd swain.
now we are met together,
Then I shall prize thy sparkling eyes.
that did invite me hither.
I have ranged the Plains about
For to find my Phillis out
My flocks I left of joys bereft
Whilst I for thee did languish
It Is in thy will my heart to fill
with joy, or else with anguish




Then fair Phillis frowning said,
My privacy thou have betrayed
Therefore be gone, let me alone
do not disturb my pleasure,
Nor do not move thy suit of love,
but leave me to my leisure.
Never yet did Shepherds Swain
On this smooth Scicilian plain
Once dare to move my deep disdain
by such like bold intrusion.
Then cease thy suit it is but in vain
I scorn such fond delusion.
When Amyntas see her frown
Hoping still his joys to crown
Quoth he my dear, as I am here
I like not this behavior,
It Is Lovers bliss, to toy and kiss
it wins a Maidens favor.
Let us like the Ivy twine.
And our loves in one combine
Grim Pluto loved Proserpine
her beauty did him fetter;
When thou art mine, and I am thine,
I Will please thee ten times better
Fie for shame fond Boy she said
Im re^olv'd to live a Maid
Thou a^t too young, to do me wrong
be not so b^ld to venture,
Whilst he ^oor youth, to speak the truth
still aimed at the center
Phillis blushed as red as blood
When his mind she understood
His bold intent for to prevent
she used her best endeavor,
His resolution it was bent
for he was loath to leave her.
Hotly he persued the Game.
Whilst his heart was on a flame
She cried pish nay fie for shame
in faith you shall not do it
But the youth her overcame
and eagerly fell to ^t.
Thus she strived all in vain
Whilst she felt a pleasing pain,
Yet he, by no means would refrain
but kindly did embrace her,
He kissed his love and told her plain
he never would disgrace her.
In great rage she flung away
Tumbling ore the new made hay
Whilst he ashamed and breathless lay
although he then displeased her
He rallied and renewed the fray.
and manfully appeased her.
Thus they spent this crystal day
in such wanton sports and play,
Amintias there, embraced his Dear.
And bid her be light-hearted
But night being come they hasted home.
and kindly kissed and parted*
