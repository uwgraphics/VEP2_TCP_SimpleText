The Complaint of Scotland.
Adieu all glaidnes, sport and play,
Adieu fair weill both nycht and day
All thing that may make mirrie cheir,
Bot sich rycht soir in heart and say,
Allace to Graif is gone my deir.
My lothsum life I may lament,
With ficit face and mind attent,
In weiping woe to perseueir,
And asking still for punischement,
Of them hes brocht to graif my deir.
Bot lang allace I may complain,
Befoir I find my deir again,
To me was faithful and Inteir,
As Turtill trew' on me tuke pain:
Allace to graif is gone my deir.
Sen nathing may my murning mend,
On God may hie I will depend
My cairfull cause for to vpreir:
For he support to me will send
Althotht to graif is gone my deir.
My hauie hap, and piteous plycht,
Dois peirs my heart both day and nycht,
That lym nor lith I may not steir,
Till sum revenge with force and mycht
The Cruel murder of my deir.
This cureles would dois grief me soir,
The like I never felt befoir
Sen Fergus first of me tuke steir,
For now allace decayis my gloir
Throw cruel murder of my deir.
O wickit wrethche Infortunat,
O Savage seid Insatiat,
Mycht thou not frantik fule forbeir
To sia with dart Intoxicat,
And cruelly deuoir my deir.
Wa worth the wretch, wa worth thy clan
Wa worth the wit that first began
This deir debait for to vpsteir,
Contrare the Lawis of God and man
To murder cruelly my deir.
Throw the now Lawles liberty
Throw the mischief and cruelty
Throw the false men their heidis up beir
Throw the is baneist equity
Throw the to graif is gone my deir.
Throw the ma Kings than ane dois ring
Throw the all Tratoures blyithlie sing
Throw the is kendlit civil weir
Throw the murder wald beir the swing,
Throw the to graif is gone my deir.
Throw the is rasit sturtsum strife,
Throw the, the vital breith of life
Is him bereft, did with the beir:
Quhen Gallow pin, or cutting knyfe
Should stranglit the and saift my deir.
Vngraitfull grome, sic recompense,
Was not condign to thine offense,
With glowing gunne that man to teir,
From doggis deith was thy defense:
To the sic mercy schew my deir.
O cursit Cain, O hound of Hell,
O bludie baitnc of Ishmaell,
Gedaliah quhen thou did steir,
To vicis all thou rang the bell,
Throw cruel murder of my deir.
Allace my deir did not foirsie,
Quhen he gaif pardone unto the
May wickit wretch, to men sinceir
Quhat pain he brocht and misery,
With reuthfull ruin to my deir.
Bot true it is, the godly men
Quhilk think na harm nor falset ken,
Nor haitrent dois to vtheres beir,
Ar sonest brocht to deithis den:
As may be seen be this my deir.
Thairfoir to the I say no moir,
Bot I traist to the King of gloir,
That thou and thine sall it reteir
our Camps, with murning mind richt soir
For cruel murder of my deir.
O Nobill Lordis of Renoun,
O Barronis bauld e make ow boun
To fute the field with fresche effeir,
And dintis doure, the pride ding down
Of them that brocht to graif my deir.
Revenge his deith with ane assent,
With ane heart, will, mind, and Intent,
In faithful freindschip perseueir:
God will ow favor, and them schent.
Be work or word that slew my deir.
Be crous e Commouns in this case,
In adventure e cry allace,
Quhen murtherars the swing sall beir,
And from our native land ow chase:
Unless that e revenge my deir.
Lat all that fische be trapt in net,
Was counsall, art, part, or reset
With thankful mind and hearty their
Or it with helping hand him met
Quhen he to graif did bring my deir.
Defend our King and feir our God,
Pray to avoid his feirfull rod,
Lest in his angry wraith austeir
e puneist be both euin and od,
For not revenging of my deir.
And do not feir the number small,
Thocht e be few, on God e call
With faithful heart, and mind sinceir,
He will be ay our brasin wall,
Gif e with speid revenge my deir.
Remufe all sluggische sleuth away,
Lat lurking Inny clean decay,
Gar Commoun weill our Baner beir,
And peace and concord it display:
Quhen e pas to revenge my deir.
With sobbing sych, I to ow send
This my complaynt with dew commend
Desyring ow all without feir,
Me pure Scotland for to defend
Sen now to graif is gone my deir.
FINIS.
