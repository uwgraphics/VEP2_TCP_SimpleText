Anno Regni Regis and REGINAE Gulielmi and MARIAE Secunds. BY THE GOVERNOR,
and COUNCIL.
WHereas the Honorable Sir William Phipps Knight is appointed to take the
Command of such Forces as shall be Raised for their Majesty's Service in the
present Expedition against the French at Nova Scotia, and L' Accadie.

All Gentlemen Soldiers that shall List themselves in the said Service, are to
appear completely Armed.

And for their Encouragement It is proposed:

1. That their Pay shall be equal to those Improved against the Indian Enemies
in all Respects.

2. If the French shall not Surrender upon the Articles offered them, but shall
necessitate our Forces to Expose themselves in the Assault; Then (God
succeeding our Arms) besides their Stated Pay, the just half of all Plunder
taken from the Enemy, shall be Shared among the Officers and Soldiers; Stores
of War only Excepted.

3. If it so happen (which God forbid) that any of ours fall in the Attempt,
Then what would rightfully have belonged to such persons, if they had lived,
shall be made good to their Widows and Children; And if none such be, to those
who have the next Legal Right.

Boston; March 24. 1689. By Order of the Governor and Council, Isaac
