A Person of very Great Quality having brought over from Italy the greatest
Secret in the World: A Powder that in 10 or 12 days time perfectly Cures the
Pox, Evil, or Scurvey, with only one Dose taking; not only Shankers, Nodes, and
Inveterate Ulcers, but also to the working out of Rotten Bones, whether from
the Pox or Evil, casting off all that is Corrupted of any kind, Sweetning the
whole Mass of Blood, and restoring the Body to Perfect Health, free from any
Relapse: The Truth of which is already in London so sufficiently Tried, that to
any Person that has occasion, and cannot be brought into a Belief from the
Testimony of Persons of Great Worth and Integrity, who are ready at all times
to affirm it; shall then see several Patients of the worst kind that have been
Cured: And if they Doubt of this, I solemnly invite them to bring out of the
Hospitals or elsewhere, any so highly Distempered, that the most unbelieving
Persons can Produce. I will Administer the Dose to them from my own Hand before
them, and in the presence of three or four Persons of Quality that they and I
shall agree upon, that are Curious to inspect so Wonderful a Cure. And though
some Gainsayers, through Ignorance or Interest, may Report this single Dose to
be dangerous in its Operation, I do declare the contrary, that it is Pleasant
to the Pallat and easy in its Operation, performing its Work in 6 or 8 hours,
and its Cure as abovesaid, only observing an Order and Regiment of Diet for the
prefixed time.

WElcome Great Secret to our English Shore,
Thou truly Greatest in all Natures Store,
Never more Welcome, never wanted more:
You that with Ulcers, Shankers, Nodes do lie,
Long cannot Live, nor yet can easily Dye,
With thy one Dose shall lay their Crutches by.
Such wondrous Virtue I have here in Store,
That none before me ever could do more
To Blind, to Lame, to Deaf, to Rich and Poor.
You that through Ignorance or Interest be
Incredulous to give Belief to me,
Ransack the Hospitals, where you may find,
Diseases of all sorts in Humane kind,
That to your Eyes most apparent be,
With Ulcers, rotten Bones, (those) bring to me,
In Twelve days time their Cure shall perfect see.
Gainsayers Mouths (then) stop your Rage to spill,
Or fear to speak one word of me that is ill,
When Demonstrations clear these Truths fulfill.
The Person is to be Spoken with, at the Two Blew-Balls in Leicester-Square.
