A PROCLAMATION For a National Fast.
WILLIAM By the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland
Defender of the Faith;
To Macers of Our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part
conjunctly and severally, specially constitute Greeting:
Forasmuchas the Holy and Righteous Dispensations of the Almighty GOD, in
sending so cold and unkindly a Season and Seed time, after two years Scarcity
and Dearth; As also the great Death of Cattle through most part of the Kingdom,
and growing Dearth and Famine threatened, do all express His high Displeasure
against this Land, and provoke him to multiply and inflict these and heavier
Judgments as the just Deservings and Effects of the Sins abounding in this
Nation, and of the great Security and impenitency under them, and therefore do
certainly call aloud for our own and our peoples deep Humiliation, under the
mighty hand of GOD, and our most earnest and solemn Application, by fasting and
Prayer for His gracious Pardon, and removing and averting the foresaids
Judgments, and turning us sincerely to the LORD. Upon which Considerations,
the provincial Synod of Lothian and Tweddale with a Commity of the Commission
from the General Assembly, have likewise addressed the Lords of Our Privy
Council, that a Day of Humiliation may be appointed and kept for these
Causes, and others mentioned in their said Address, throughout the whole
Kingdom: Therefore, We with the Advice of the Lords of Our Privy Council,
Command and Appoint a Day of Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer, to be kept and
observed within the Bounds of the Provincial Synod of Lothian and Tweddale,
upon Tuesday the seventeenth Day of this current Month of May, and upon the
twenty fifth Day of the said Month for the rest of the Kingdom upon this side
of the River of Tay, and throughout the rest of the whole Kingdom, upon the
first Day of June nixt to come: Upon which Days respective, We and Our People
are to be deeply humbled before GOD, for the manifold Sins and Provocations,
that so openly abound in the Land, and in which men still continue secure and
hardened, notwithstanding of GOD'S great Mercy and Deliverance wrought for us,
and of frequent Confessions and former Fasts, which yet have produced no
Amendment or Reformation, and therefore to deprecat his deserved Wrath, and to
implore his Mercy and Grace, and that the LORD may turn unto us; and turn Us
and Our People to Him, and avert the Judgment hanging over Us, and other Evils
wherewith we are so eminently threatened, and send kindly Weather to cherish the
Fruits of the Earth for Food to man and Beast: Which respective Days of solemn
Humiliation and Prayer above appointed; We with Advice foresaid Require and
Command, to be most religiously and seriously observed by all our People by
public Prayer, Preaching and all other Acts of deep Humiliation and Devotion,
suitable to the foresaids Causes and Occasions. OUR WILL IS HEREFORE and We
Charge you strictly and Command, that incontinent their Our Letters seen, ye
pass to the Market Cross of Edinburgh, and to the remanent Mercat-Crosses of
the head Burghs of the several Shires and Steuartries within this Kingdom, and
there in our Name and Authority make Publication hereof, that none pretend
Ignorance; And We ordain Our Solicitor to dispatch Copies hereof to the
Shireffs of the several Shires, and Stewarts of Stewartries and their Deputs or
Clerks, to be by them published at the Market Crosses of their head Burghs upon
receipt thereof and immediately sent to the several Ministers, to the effect the
same may be intimat and read in their several Paroches-Churches, upon the Lords
Day immediately preceding the respective Days above-appointed. And ordains their
presents to be printed. And allows the Causes of this Fast given in to the
Lords of Our Privy Council, by the Provincial Synod of Lothian and Tweddale, to
be also printed and transmitted herewith.

Given under Our Signet at Edinburgh the tenth day of May one thousand six
hundred ninety and eight years, and of Our Reign the Tenth Year. Per Actum
Dominorum Secreti Concilii. GILB ELIOT, Cls. Sti. Concilii.
