Courage Crowned with Conquest;
OR, (...) brief Relation, how that Valiant Knight, and that Heroic Champion
Sir Eglamore bravely sought with, and manfully slew a terrible huge great
Monstrous Dragon.

To a pleasant New Tune.


SIr Eglamore that valiant Knight
with his fa, la, lanctree down dillie,
He feteht his sword and he went to fight;
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
As he went over hill and dale
All clothed in his Coat of Male,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
A huge great Dragon leapt out of his Den
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
Which had killed the Lord knows how many men
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
But when he saw Sir Eglamore
Good lack had you seen how this Dragon did roar
with his fa la lanctre. etc.
This Dragon he had a plaguey hide
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
Which could both sword and spear abide
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
He could not enter with hacks and cuts
Which vexed the Knight to the very hearts blood and guts,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
All the Trees in the Wood did shake
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
Stars did tremble and men did quake,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
But had you seen how the Birds lay peeping
'Twould have made a man's heart to fall a weeping
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
The second Part,
To the same Tune.


BUt it was too late to fear,
with his fa la lanctre. etc,
For now it was come to fight Dog, fight Bare
with his fa la lanctre etc
And as a yawning he did fall
He thrust in his Sword hilt and all,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
But now as the Knight in choler did burn
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
He owed the Dragon a shrewd good turn
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
In at his mouth the Sword he bent,
The hilt appeared at his fundament,
with his fa la, etc.
Then the Dragon like a coward began to fly
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
Unto his Den that was hard by
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
And there he laid him down and roared
The Knight was vexed for his Sword
with a fa la lanctre, etc.
The Sword that was of a right good Blade;
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
As ever Turk or Spaniard made,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
I for my part do forsake it
And he that will fetch it let him take it
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
When all this was done, to the Alehouse he went
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
And by and by his two pence he spent Dragon
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
For he was so hot with tuging with the
That nothing would quench him but a whole Flagon.
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
Now God preserve our King and Queen,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
And eke in London may be seen,
with his fa la lanctre, etc.
As many Knights and as many more,
And all so good as Sir Eglamore. ^
with his fa la langtre down dillie.
