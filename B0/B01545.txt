The Bedford-shire VVidow;
OR, The Poor in Distress Relieved,
Being a full and true Relation, of a poor Widow, whose Husband was dead, and
she turned out of doors by her Creditors, and forced with her three Children to
lie in the street, and Beg for Bread; and how that Queen Mary, walking in her
Garden, and hearing her Beg came to her, and caused her children to be clothed
and put to Nurse, and gave the poor widow, a weekly pension, to maintain her as
long as she lived.

To the Tune of, Let Caesar live long.
Licensed according to Order,





IN Scripture we read how that Dorcas the good,
Did daily supply the poor Widows with Food.
And many Examples besides we may find;
All which have been Acted by good Women kind,
But none e're more great, or yet glorious were seen,
Than this Pious Act of good Mary our Queen.
One time it so chanced, on a morning so fair:
Queen Mary did walk for to take the fresh Air,
In her Garden so Richly bedecked with Flowers,
Where, she with delights, did pass several hours,
There sitting her down in an Arbor alone,
She heard a poor widow, make pitiful moan.
The Queen much admiring to hear such a cry,
She looked through a wicket, where she did espy
A widow, as likewise, three Children small,
Who lay in the street, without side of the wall,
Begging for Money for to buy them Bread,
Who with hunger and pining, were almost quite dead
The Queen, she did open the wicket streightway,
And unto the widow, Queen Mary did say,
Good woman I pray you, now why do you cry?
The woman, not knowing her, thus did reply,
My want it is great, I shall perish for need,
And this is the cause of my mourning indeed.
My Husband in Prison was cast and is dead;
The Stones are my Couch, and the Streets is my Bed;
My Creditors cruel have seized of all,
Poor I and my Children have nothing at all;
The Lord be my comfort or else I shall dye,
For here in much hunger, and pain I do lie.
In Bedford-shire, I was born, it is well known.
My Father had Houses and Land of his own,
But now I am poor, and nothing I have,
I wish I was put alive into my Grave;
Friends I have none, and my bread it is scant,
That I and my Babes, we shall perish for want.
I have a brother, who riches has store,
Yet now will not own me, because I am poor;
He tells me, my Fortune was once very great,
When I had full plenty, and lived in State;
He will give me nothing, he often does say,
Though I have entreated him day after day.
The Queen did reply, now I pray be content,
For some good provision to you shall be sent;
Rely upon God, who for you will provide,
And for your poor Children also beside;
Ask and receive, in full plenty therefore,
He always regards the cries of the Poor.
Queen Mary, she then did immediately call,
Saying bring this Poor Woman and Children small,
Now into my Palace, where let them remain;
The widow perceiving, it was Mary our Queen,
She was so amazed, on the ground, as she lay,
That not one poor word for her self she could say.
Some Victuals were brought, and they heartily fed;
VVarm Clothes were provided, as also a bed;
The Children, were then put to Nurse with all speed,
The Queen a good Almshouse to the widow decreed,
And likewise a Pension, for her did ordain,
And now the poor widow is happy again.
