A lamentable new Ditty, made upon the death of a worthy Gentleman, named
George Stool, dwelling sometime on Gate-side Moore, and sometime at New Castle
in Northumberland: with his penitent end.
To a delicate Scottish Tune.


COme you lusty Northern Lads,
that are so blithe and bonny,
Prepare your hearts to be full sad,
to hear the end of Georgy,
Heigh ho, Heigh-ho my bony love,
Heigh-ho, heigh ho my honny;
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho my own dear love
and God be with my Georgie.
When Georgie to his trial came,
a thousand hearts were sorry,
A thousand Lasses wept full sore,
and all for love of Georgy.
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, my bony Love,
heigho, etc.
Some did say he would escape,
some at his fall did glory:
But these wers Clownes and fickle friends,
and none that loved Georgy.
Heigh-ho, etc.
Might friends have satisfide the Law,
then Gorgie would find many:
Yet bravely did he plead for life,
if mercy might be any.
Heigh-ho, etc.
But when this doughty Carle was cast
he was full sad and sorry:
Yet boldly did he take his death,
so patiently did Georgie.
Heigh-ho, etc.
As Georgie went up to the Gate,
He took his leave of many:
He took his leave of his Lards wife,
whom ho loved best of any.
Heigh-ho, etc.
With thousand sighs and heavy looks,
away from thence he parted:
Where he so often blithe had been,
though now so heavy hearted.
Heigh-ho, etc.
He writ a Letter with his own hand,
he thought he writ it bravely:
He sent it to New Castle Town,
to his beloved Lady.
Heigh-ho, etc.
Wherein he did at large bewail,
the occasion of his folly:
Bequeathing life unto the Law,
his soul to heaven holy:
Heigh-ho, etc.
Why Lady, leave to weep for me,
let not my ending grieve ye:
Prove costant to the ney yon love,
for I cannot relieve ye.
Heigh-ho, etc.
Out upon the Withrington,
and fie upon the Phoenix:
Thou have out down the doughty one
that stole the sheep from Anix.
The second part,
To the same tune.




ANd sie on all such cruel Carles,
whose crueltie's so fickle:
To cast away a Gentleman
in hatred for so little.
Heigh-ho heigh-ho, my bonny Love,
heigh-ho, etc.
I would I were on yonder Hill,
where I have been full merry:
My sword and buckeler by my side
to fight till I be weary.
Heigh-ho etc.
They well, should know that took me first
though whoops be now forsaken:
Had I but freedom, arms, and health,
I Would dye, are I Would be taken.
Heigh-ho, etc.
But Law comdemns me to my grave,
they have me in their power:
There Is none but Christ that can me save,
at this my dying hour.
Heigh-ho. etc.
He called his dearest love to him,
when as his heart wae sorry:
And speaking thus with manly heart,
Dear sweeting, pray for Georgie.
Heigh-ho, etc.
He gave to her a piece of gold,
and bade her giue't her Barnes:
And often he kissed her rosy lips,
and laid him into her arms.
Heigh-ho, etc.
And coming to the place of death,
he never changed color.
The more they thought he would looks pale*
the more his veins were fuller.
Heigh-ho, etc.
And with a cheerful countenance,
(being at that time entreated
For to confess his former life)
these-words he straight repeated.
Heigh-ho etc.
I never stole no Ox nor Cow,
nor never murdered any:
But fifty Horse I did receive
of a Merchants man of Gory.
Heigh-ho, etc.
For which I am condemned to dye,
though guiltless I stand dying:
Dear gracious God, my soul receive
for now my life is flying.
Heigh-ho, etc.
The man of death a part did act,
which grieves me tell the story.
God comfort all are comfortless,
and did so well as Georgie.
Heigh-ho, Heigh-ho, my bonny Love,
heigh-ho heigh-my bonny,
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, mine own true lou
sweet Christ receive my Georgie.
FINIS.
