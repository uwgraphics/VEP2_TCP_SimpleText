Ienny, Ienny; Or, The false-hearted Knight, And Kind-hearted Lass.
^e wooed fair Jenny, but he would not be wed,
He only sued to get her Maidenhead,
Which having got, he did poor Jenny slight,
And left her like a false disloyal Knight,
Now she that was in hopes to be a Lady,
Has time enough to sing ba low my baby.
To a New Scotch Tune: Or; Jenny, Jenny, etc.




THere was a Lass in our Town,
and she was wondrous fair,
There was a Knight of high renown,
and he was wondrous rare;
It Is for the love of thee I dye,
Jenny, Jenny,
It Is for the love of thee I dye
Jenny, Jenny.
It Is pity that a Knight so gay,
should die for the love of me,
I had rather lose my life to day,
then such a thing should be.
Then gang along with me, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny,
Then gang along with me, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny.
What would my Daddy and Mammy say
if I with thee should ben,
That sure I was run away
with whom I did not ken.
Pish, lay all she blame upon my back,
Jenny, Jenny,
Lig all the blame upon my back,
Jenny, Jenny.
But what if I should prove with Child,
as it perhaps may be,
Then you must provide a Nursing bower,
for your young son and me.
Then down to yonder Green-wood go,
Jenny, quoth he,
Then down to yonder Green-wood go,
Jenny, Jenny.




ANd down in yonder green-wood,
I ken it well of old,
Where I shall sustain enough of
both hunger and of cold.
Then lig the Trees upon the fire,
Jenny, quoth he,
Then lig the Trees upon the fire.
Jenny, Jenny.
Now you have had your will of me,
and brought me unto shame,
If I do beg some boons of ye,
say not I am too blame:
Well fare thy bonny brow, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny,
Now tell what thou would have of me:
Jenny, Jenny.
May't please your kind courtesy
to gang under yonder is town,
May't please your kind courtesy
to buy me a Silken Gown.
Mend the old one for a new, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny,
Mend the old for a new, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny.
May't please you of, kind courtesy
to gang into yonder Fare,
May't please your kind courtesy,
to buy me an ambling Mare.
Ride on thy Spinning-wheel, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny,
Ride on thy Spinning-wheel, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny.
I pray you will not angry be
whilst I beg one small Boon,
May't please your kind courtesy
to buy me a pair of Shoon.
Let him that rides thee next, shoe thee quoth. he.
Jenny, Jenny,
For thou shall never be shod by me,
Jenny, Jenny.
Once more I beg your kind courtesy,
to gang to yonder is Leek,
And there do so much for me
as buy me a seeing Kit.
Kit even in the Well, quoth he,
Jenny, Jenny,
For there thy beauty thou may see,
Jenny, Jenny.
By this young Lasses all may learn
how they do yield to love,
And not to trust deluding men,
that will false hearted prove.
Had Jenny kept her Maidenhead,
she might a lived free,
But now I do lament the case
of Jenny, Jenny.
