Unto the most excellent princes que^^ Catharine / the most gracious wife
(...) to the most noble and mighty prince king Henry the.viij. her humble
bedman and orator Richard Hyrd prayeng good prosperity and welfare.
WEre it not most excellent princess / that the consideration of your great
goodness and benignite did as much encorage and bold me / as the respect
and regard of mine own ignorance retardeth me and holds back / I never
durst presume to dedicate and present unto the majesty of your noble grace
this my rude and simple translation / so much the more vncumly and unmeet to
be offered in your high presence / in how much theloquence of thautour
stayneth and defaceth the rude speech of the translatour. For had I most
gracious princess that gift of erudition and utterance / that I were able in
our english tongue / to give this book as much perspicuite / light / life /
favor / grace / and quickenes / as master Jews Viues has given hit in Laten
/ than durst I boldly put hit forth to your grace / not without good hope of
thank / considering the matter to be such / as neither a more profitable nor
more necessary can lightly comme in hand. For what is more fruitful than the
good education and order of women / the one half of all mankind / and that
half also / whose good behauour or evil tatchis gives or bereueth the other
half / almost all the holle pleasure and co^modite of this present life /
byside the furtherance or hynderance forther growyng there upon / concerning
the life to come? And surely for the plantynge and nurysshynge of good virtuous
in every kind of women / virgins / wives / and wydowes / I verily believe
there was never any treatis made / either furnisshed with more goodly
counsayles / or set out with more effectual reasons / or garnysshed with
more substanciall authoritees or stored more plentuously of convenient examples
/ nor all these things to gether more goodly treated and handeled / than
master Viues has done in his book: Which book when I read / I wisshed in my
mind that either in every country women were learned in the latin tongue / or
the book out of latin translated in to every tongue: and much I marueiled / as
I often do / of the unreasonable over sight of men / which never ceace to
complain of women's conditions. And yet having the education and order of them
in their own hands / not only do litell diligence to teach them and bring
them up better / but also purposely with draw them fro learning / by which
they might have occasyons to wax better by them self. But since this fault is
so far gone and over largely spredde / to be shortly remedied / I thought at
the least wise for my part hit would do well to translate this book into our
englisshe tongue / for the commodite and profit of our own country. Which
when I had secretly done by my self / I showed hit unto my syngular good
master and brynger up Sir Thomas More / to whose judgment and correction I
use to submyt what so ever I do or go about / that I set any store by: who not
only for the matter it self was very glad thereof / but also for that (as he
than showed me) he perceived that hit should be to your noble majesty for the
gracious zele that ye bear to the virtuous education of the womankynde of this
realm / whereof our lord has ordained you to be queen / so great and special
pleasure / that he had intended / his manyfolde busynes not withstandyng / to
have taken the times to have translated this book him self / in which he was
(as he said) very glad that he was now prevented / nor for eschewyng of his
labor / which he would have be^ very glad to bestow there in / but for
because that the fruit thereof may now sooner come forth than he could have
found the time. How be it as I answered him / It were better to bring forth
datis in an hundred years (for so long hit is or that tree bring forth his
fruit) than crabbis in.iiij. year. And though he rekenned him self easedde of
the translatynge I besoughte him to take the labor to read hit over / and
correct hit. Which he right gladlye did. Wherbye I have been the more
encoraged to put forth unto your most noble grace this translation: to whose
majesty since the original work was dedicate / I was of very duty me thought
bounden to dedicate the translation. Wherefore if there be / as I well wot
there is / any good in the matter / thank be to master Viues the maker: if
any thing be well in this translation / thank be to the labor of my good
master. For nothing in this work claim I for mine own / but the show of
my good zele to do good to other / and seruyse to your noble grace: whom with
the sacredde majesty of the most excellent prince your derest spouse / and
your noble issue / with encrese of more / our lord long preserve in to the
weal of your self / your realm / and all Christendom beside.

The preface of the most famous clerk master Lodouic Viues upon his book
called the Instruction of a Christen woman unto the most gracious princes
Katharine queen of England.
I Have been moved partly by the holiness and goodness of your living / partly by
the favor and love that your grace bears toward holy study / and learning /
to write some thing unto your good grace / of thinformacion and bryngyng up of
a Christen woman: A matter never yet entreated of any man / among so great
plenty and variete of wits and writers. For Xenophon and Aristotel gyuyng
rules of housekepynge / and Plato making precepts of orderyng the common
weal / speak many things apperteynynge unto the woman's office and dewte: And
saint Cyprian / saint Hieronyme / saint Ambrose / and saint Augustine / have
entreated of maids and wydowes: but in such wise / that they appear rather
texhort and counsel them unto some kind of living / than to instruct and
teache them. They spend all their speech in the lauds and praises of chastity:
which is a goodly thing and syttyng for those great wytted and holy men: How
be it / they write but few precepts and rules / how to live: supposyng hit
to be better / to exhort them unto the best / and help them up to the
highest: than to inform and teach the lower things. But I will let pass all
such exhortatio^s / because every body shall chose and pyke out the ways of
living / out of these men's authorite / rather than of my fa^tasie: and I will
co^pyle rules of living. Therefore in the first book / I will begin at the
beginning of a woman's life / and lead her forth unto the time of marriage. In
the second / from marriage unto wydowehede: how she ought to pass the time of
her life well and virtuously with her husband. In the last book I inform and
teache the wydowhed. And because the matter could not be other wise handeled /
there be many things told in the first book / perteynynge unto wives and
wydowes: and much in the second belonging unto unmarried women: and some in
the third perteynyng unto all: Lest a maid should think that she need to read
but only the first book / or a wife the second / or a wydowe only the
third. I will yt every of them shall read all. In which I have been more short
/ tha^ many would I should have been. Not withstandyng who so consydreth well ye
cause of mine intent / and takes good head / shall find hit done not without
a skyll. For in gyuynge precepts / a man ought specially to be brefe: lest he
sooner dull the wits of ye reders / tha^ teache them / with long babbling. And
precepts ought to be such / that every body may soon can them / and bear
easily in mind. Nor we should not be ignorant of the laws that Christ and
his disciples / Petre / Paul / James / John^ / and Jude taught us: where we
may se that they give us ye divine precepts brefe and shortly: For who can
bear in remembrance those laws / which they bear not well in mind / that
have spend their holle life in study of them. And therefore have I neither
thrust in many examples / nor gone out of my matter to entreat generally of
vice and virtue / which were a large field to walk in: unto the^de that my
book might be not only red without tediousnes: but also be read often. More
over though the precepts for men be innumerable: women yet may be enfourmed
with few words. For men must be occupied both at home and forth abroad /
both in their own matters and for the common weal. Therefore hit can not be
declared in few books / but in many and long / how they shall handle them
self in so many and diverse things. As for a woman has no charge to se to /
but her honesty and chastyte. Wherefore when she is enfurmed of that / she is
sufficiently appointed. Wherefore their wyckednes is the more cursed and
detestable / that go about to perisshe that one treasure of women: as though a
man had but one eye / and an other would go about to put it out. Some write
filthy and baudye rymes. Which me^ I can not se what honest excuse they can
ley for them self: But that their corrupt mind / and swelled with poison /
can breathe non other thing but venom / to distroye them that are nere unto
hit. But they call them self lovers / and I believe they be so in deed / ye and
blind and mad to withal. And though thou love / can thou not opteyne
thine own / except thou infecte all other therefore? In my mind no man was
ever banysshed more ryghtfully / tha^ was Ouide / at lest wise if he was
banisshed for writing the craft of love. For other write wa^ton and noughty
balades / but this worshipful artificer / must make rules in goddis name and
precepts of his unthriftiness / a schole master of baudry / and a common
corrupter of virtue. Now I doubt not but some will think my precepts over
sore and sharp. How be it the nature of all things is such / that the way
of virtue is easy and large unto good me^ / and the way of vice contrary /
strayte and roughe. But unto ill men neither the way that they go in is
pleasant / nor ye way of virtue large and easy enough: and seeing it is so /
hit is better to assent unto good men than ill: and rather to reken ye bad
folks opinion false / than the good men's. Pythagoras the philosopher / and
other of his schole / in the description of this letter. Y. say / that when a
man is paste the first difficulte of virtue / all after is easy and plain.

Plato gives counsel to chose the best way in living: which way use and
custom shall also make pleasant. Our lord in the gospel says / that the
way into the kingdom of heaven is strayte / not because it is so in deed / but
because few go it: except a man would count his words false / where he says:
My yocke is sweet and my burden light. Orels where he promyseth / that there
is no man that forgoth any thing for his sake / but he shall have far more for
it again / yea and that in this life. And what was meant thereby / but the
pleasures of virtue? Therefore I se unto whom my precepts shall seem rigorous
and sharp / that is young me^ / that be ignorant / wanton and vnthriftye:
which can not ones bear the sight of a good woman. And like as ra^ke horses
neye unto every mare / so they go about every tryflyng and pyuysshe wenche /
that has a pleasure to be looked upon and loved. and they would have their
folly to be allowable by the multitude of mysdoers. As who says / the agreement
and abusion of people might change the nature of things. Hit is no news /
that il folk hate them that auyse them well. For Theophraste when he wrote of
this same matter / and spoke much of marriage sadlye and wisely / he set
commen harlottis in his top. And one Leontium the concubyne of Metrodorus /
started out and babled forth a book without all reason / or shame / against
that man most excellent in wisdom and eloquence: which deed was thought so
intolerable / yt as though no more hope of goodness were left / there rose up a
proverb of that matter / that the next remedy was to seek a tree to go hang
upon. Saint Hierome writes of him self unto the holy maid Demetrias in this
wise: More than thyrty year ago / I write a book of virginite / in ye which I
must needs speak against vice and patefy the trappes of the devil / for the
instruction of the maid that I taught: the which writing many be agreued
withal: when every one takes the matter / as said by him self / and will not
here me as an exhortour and counselloure / but lothis me as an accuser and
rebuker of his doing. Thus says he. Lo what manner of men we shall displease
with teaching them vertuouslye: verily such as were a shame and rebuke to
please: but sad men / chaste maids / virtuous wives / wise wydowes / and
fynallye all that are true christen people / not only in name but also in deed
and with their hertes / will stand on our party / which know and agree all
in this / that nothing can be more mylde and gentle tha^ the precepts of our
faith. From ye which Christ grant us never to declyne our mind and purpose
one hears bread. I have put in remembrance of their duete the good and holy
women but sleyghtly / other now and than I take up sharply: because I saw
that only techyng avails but a little / unto those that strugle with the
leader / and must be drawn. Therefore have I spoken sometime the more plainly:
that they might se the filthynes of their conditions / as hit were painted in a
table / to thinte^t that they should be ashamed / and at last leave their
shameful deeds: And also that good women should be gladder to se them self out
of those vices / and labor more to be further from them / and to enter in to ye
abitacle of virtue. For I had leauer as saint Hieronyme counsayleth / aue^ture
my shamefastnes a little while / than ieoperde my matter: so yet that I would
not fall in to any uncleanliness: which were the greattest shame that can be /
for him yt should be a master of chastity: wherefore often times the reder must
understand more in sentence tha^ I speak in words. And this work most
excellent and gracious queen / I offer unto you in like manner as if a peynter
would bring unto you your own visage and image / most counnyngly peynted.
For like as in that purtrature you might se your bodilye simylitude: so in
these books shall you se the resemblau^ce of your mind and goodness: because
that you have been both maid / wife / and wydowe / and wife again: as I
pray god you may long continue: and so you have handled your self in all
thordre and course of your life: that what so ever you did might be an example
unto other to live after. But you had leauer the virtues to be preysed than
your self: how be hit no man can preyse the virtues of women / but he must
needs co^prehende you in the same preyse: how be it your mind ought to be
obeyed. Therefore you shall understand / that many like unto you be preysed
here / by name expressly: but your self spoken of continually / though you be
not named. For virtues can never be preysed / but they must needs be preysed
with all / that be excellent in them / though their name be not spoken of.

Also your dereste daughter Mary shall read these instructions of mine / and
follow in living / which she must needs do: if she order her self after
thexa^ple that she has at home with her of your virtue and wisdom. Nor there
is no doubt / but she will do after them / and except she alone of all other /
dysapoynt and begyle every man's opinion / she must needs be both very good
and holy / that is comme of you and noble king Henry ye viij. such a couple of
mates: that your honor and virtue pass all crafts of preysynge. Therefore all
other women shall have an example of your life and deeds: and by these books
that I have dedicated unto your name / theys shall have rules and precepts to
live by: and so shall they be bounden unto your goodness / both for that /
which it self has done in gyuyng example: and that hit has been thoccasion
of my writing. And so I pray god give your good grace long well to fare. At
Bruges the year of our lord. M.D. and.xxiij. the v. day of Aprile.

The first book of the instruction of a Christen woman.
Of the bryngyng up of the maid Wha^ she is a babe. The first chaptre.
FAbius Quintilian in his book where he does instruct and teach an orator /
wylleth his beginning and entrance to be taken from the cradell / and no time
to be slacked vnapplied to ward the end and purpose of ye faculte intended:
Now much more dylygence ought to be given in a Christen virgin / that we may
both enfourme her encreace and order it and her instruction and entering / and
that by and by from the milk: which I would / if hit were possible / should
be the mothers: And the same counsel gives Plutarche and Phauorine / and
many other of the wysest and greattest philosophers. For by that means the
love shall be the more between the mother and the daughter / when none of the
mothers name shall be taken from her and put unto any other. For nurces be
wont also to be called mothers. And the mother may more truly reken her
daughter her own / whom she has not only borne in her womb and brought in
to ye world / but also has carried still in her arms of a babe / unto whom
she has given tete / whom she has nourisshed with her own blod / whose
slepes she has cherisshed in her lap / and has cherfully accepted and
kyssed the first laughes / and first has joyfully herd ye stameryng of hit /
covering to speak / and has holden hard to her breast / prayenge hit good
luck and fortune. These things shall cause and ingendre such reverent and
inward love in the daughter toward the mother again / yt she shall be far
more loved and set by of her daughter / because of ye love that she has so
abundantly conceived toward her in grene and tender age. Who can now express
/ what charity these things encreace among folk / when wild beasts that
have no knowledge nor parceiuyng what love means / yet love their noryshers
and bryngers up / nor shon the dangers of death to defend and save them? More
over I wot not how / but so hit is / that we sowke out of our mothers teate to
gether with the milk not only love but also conditions and dispositions. And
that is the cause says the philosopher Phauorine / that makes men to maruayle
why they se many children / commen of chaste and good women / nothing like
their parents / neither in mind nor body: nor the comen saying come up of
naught / which is not unknown not unto children: They that have been nurced
with sowes milk have rolled in the myer. For that cause the wise man
Chrysippus bad chose the wyseste and best nurces. Which precepte I my self
will ensue and counsel ye mothers / that may not norisshe their children with
their own milk / to do likewise. Neither I will so great diligence to be given
in sekyng a nurce for a boy as for a maid. Quintilian thought it sufficient to
command that the nurces should not be foul and rude spoken / by cause the
ways and manner of speaking taken in youth / would be hard to get away. As
for their manners he cared not so greatly / Which the man child does ofter
learn from home than at home. And yet he does allege the opinion of Chrysippus
as though he allowed the same. But the maid / whom we would have specially
good / requires al intendaunce both of father and mother / lest any spotte of
vice or uncleanliness should stycke on her: Let her take no such things neither
by her bodily senses and wits / nor by her norishyng and bryngyng up. She
shall first here her nurce / first se her: and what so ever she lerneth in rude
and ignorant age / that will she ever labor to counterfete and follow
counnyngly. Therefore saint Hieronyme / when he did teach the daughter of Leta
/ he warned that the nurce should be no drunkarde / nor wanton / nor full of
talk and chattyng.

Of the residue of her infancy. The second Chapter.
AFter that she is ones weaned and begins to speak and go / let all her play
and pastyme be with maids of her own age / and within the presence either of
her mother or of her nurce / or some other honest woman of sad age / yt may
rule and measure the plays and pastymes of her mind / and set them to
honesty and verue. Avoid all man's kyn away from her: nor let her not learn
to delight among men. For naturally our love contynueth the longest toward
them / with whom we have passed our time in youth. Which affection of love is
the most strong with women: because they be more disposed to pleasure and
dalyance. Now in that age / which can not yet discern good from badde / they
should be taught none yuell. And hit is an ungracious opinyon of them that say /
they will have their children to know both good and yuell. For by that means
they say they shall the better fle vice and follow virtue. But hit were more
suertie / and more profitable / and thereto more happy / not only to do none
ill / but also not ones to know hit. For who has not hard / that we were
cast i^ to misery / that self hour that the first ancetries of mankind knew
what was good and what was badde? And verily / fathers yt will not have their
children inexpert and ignorant of yuell / be worthy that their children should
know both good and ill: And when they repent them of their yuel doing / should
call yet unto remembrance / that they learned to do yuel by their fathers mind
and will. Let the maid learn none uncleanly words / or wa^to^ / or uncomely
gesture and mouyng of ye body / not so much as tha^ wha^ she is yet ignorant
what she does / and innocent. For she shall do the same / when she is grown
bygger and of more discretion. And it chances unto many / that what thing so
ever they have been accustomed i^ before / they do the same afterward at
vnwarres and vnauysedly. And often times such braydes come upon them against
their will. And the worse they be / the oftener they do them. For folks minds
bear them better away. Let the father and mother be well ware that they allow
none uncomely deed of her / neither by words / laughing / nor countenance /
neither kiss and enbrace her therefore: which is the foulest deed of all. For
ye maid will labor to rehearse often that / which she thinks shall please
best her father and mother. Let all her bringing up be pure and chaste the
first years / because of her manners / ye which take their first furmyng of yt
custom in youth and infancy.

Of her exercise. The third Chapter.
When she is of age able to learn any thy^g / let her begin with that /
which perteyneth unto the orname^t of her soul / and the keeping and ordryng
of an house. How be it I appoint no time to begin. Some reken best to begin
at the seventh year: in which opinion are Aristotel / Eratosthenes / and
Chrysippus. Quintilian would begin at the fourth or fyfte year. But I put
all ye ordryng of this matter in the discrecion of the fathers and mothers:
which may take auysement after the qualities and complexions of the child: so
they be not let with inordinate affection: by reason whereof some set so
much by their children / and care so sore for them / yt they keep them from
all labor: lest they should fall in to any syckenes. So when they wene to
increase and strength their bodies / they bruise and weaken them. The
cherisshynge and suffrance of the fathers and mothers hurts much the
children / that gives them an unbridled liberty unto vice infinite: and
specially ye maids. But these be refrayned and holden under for the most part
by fear: Which if hit lack / than has she all the bridell of nature at
large / and runs heedlonge unto mischief / and drowneth her self therein:
and comes not lightly to any goodness / without she be of nature such as we
may se some. Therefore let her both learn her book / and beside that / to
handle wolle and flax: which are two crafts yet left of that old innocent
world / both profitable and kepers of temperance: which thing specially
women ought to have in price. I will meddle here with no low matters / lest I
should seem to make much ado about things that be to simple for my purpose.
But I would in no wise that a woman should be ignorant in those feats / that
must be done by hand: no not though she be a princes or a queen. For what can
she do better / or ought to do rather / what time she has ryd her busynes in
her house? Should she talk with men or other women? And what shall she still
talk of? Shall she never hold her peace? Or shall she sit and muse? What I
pray you? Woman's thought is swyfte / and for ye most part unstable / walkyng
and wandering out from home / and sone will slide / by the reason of it own
slypernes / I wot not how far. Therefore redyng were the best / and there unto
I give them counsel specially. But yet when she is weary of redynge / I can
not se her idell as it were the women of Perse land / drowned in volupters and
pleasures / sitty^g among the company of gelded men / singing and
bankettynge contynually: Which pleasures were often changed and renewed to
eschew tediousnes: and the end of one pleasure was the beginning of another
following. Saint Hieronyme would have Paula to handle wolle / that most noble
woman commen of the blood of Scipio and Gracchus: which was also descended of
the lynage of king Agamemnon the prince of all kings: and to learn to dress
it / and to hold and occupy a rock / with a wolle basket in her lap / and
turn the spyndel / and draw forth ye threde with her own fyngers. And
Demetrias / which was as great of birth / as mighty of possessions as she /
he bad have wolle in her hands: and her self either to spynne / to warpe /
orels wind spyndels in a case for to throw wofe of / and to wind on clewes
the spynnyng of others / and to order such as should be wouen. For the
dressyng of wolle has been ever an honest occupatio^ for a good woman. In Rome
all maids / wha^ they were first married / brought unto their husbands house
dystaffe and spyndell with wolle / and wyped / stryked / and garnysshed the
posts with wolle. Which thing was a great ceremony with them. And aft / she
should be made sytte on a fell with wolle / that she might learn / what she
ought to do at home. Than after ward she should say these words unto her
husband: Where as you art Caius / there am I Caia. Now was this Caia Tanaquil
an Etruscian borne / a very noble woman and a sad / wife unto king Tarquine
Priscus. Which Caia Tanaquil used all her labor in wolle. Therefore after her
death she was worshypped for a goddis / and her image set up with a rock / as a
token and a sign of chastity and labor. Also there was a custom to cry at
ye weddyng ofte^tymes / Thalassio Thalassio / that is as ye would say / The
wolle basket The wolle basket: to thentent / the new married wife should
remember / what she should have to do. Therefore it was rekened a sign of a wise
and a chaste woman to do that busynes. The kings son of Rome / and noble
young men of the kings blood / when they fell at argument about their wives /
and came suddenly home to Rome / they found other of the kings daughters in
law among their companions and mates making good chere: But they found
Lucrecia syttyng at her wolle until late in the night / and her maids busy
about her / in her own house. Than all they by one assent gave her the price
of goodness and chastity. What time all the empire and dominion of Rome was in
Augustus hands / yet he set his daughters and his necis to work upon wolle.
Like wise Terence / where he does describe a sobre and a chaste yo^ge woman
says: Getting her living by wolle and web. And Solomon / where he does
speak of the preyse of an holy woman says: She sought for wolle and flax: and
wrought by the counsel of her hands. Nor it makes no force after my mind /
whether it be wolle or flax / for both perteyne unto the necessary uses of
our life: and be honest occupations for women. Anna mother unto Samuel the
prophet / made with her own hands a lynen rochet for her son. The most
chaste queen of Ithace Penelope passed the.xx. years that her husband was away
/ with weauynge. Queen's of Macidony and Epyre weaued garments with their own
hands / for their husbands / and brethren / and fathers / and children: of
which manner garments / king Alexander showed some unto the queen's of Perse
land / that his mother and sisters had made. Writers of histories make mention
/ that molde time there was wont in Spain great wagers to be laid / who
should spy^ne / or weaue most / and times were appointed to bring forth their
work to show it / and give judgment of hit. And great honor and preyse was
given unto them / that labored most and dilygentlyest. And yet unto this day /
remains the same mind and love of sobre sadness in many: and thapplyenge of
their work is bosted and talked of: And among all good women hit is a great
shame to be idell. Therefore queen Isabell king Fardinandos wife taught her
daughters to spynne / sow / and peynte: of whom two were queen's of Portugal /
the third of Spain / mother unto Carolus Caesar: and the fourth most holy
and devout wife unto the most gracious king Henry the.viij. of England. Let
the maid also learn cookery / not that slubberyng and excess in meats to
serve a great meyny / full of delicious pleasures and glotony: which cooks
meddle with / but sobre and measurable / that she may learn to dress meat for
her father / and mother / and brethren / while she is a maid: and for her
husband and children / when she is a wife: and so shall she get her great
thank both of the one and the other: when she does not lay all the labor upon
the servants: But her self prepare such things as shall be more pleasant
unto her father and mother brethren / and husband / and children / than if
they were dressed by servants. And that the more pleasant / if they were seek.
Nor let no body loathe the name of the kechyn: namely being a thing very
necessary: without the which neither seek folks can amend nor holle folks
live. The which occupacion Achilles both a king and a kings son and a lord
most noble did not disdain to do. For what time Ulysses and Nestor came to him
/ for agreement between him and Agamemnon / he laid ye tables him self / and
tucked up his clothes / and went in to the kechyn / and prepared their meat /
to make the noble princes sobre and te^perate chere / whom he loved so well.
Also hit is a thing perteynyng unto temperance and honesty: for when the
maistres or her daughter is by / all thing is done ye more diligently. What
deyntenes of hand is that / and what lothyng of the kechyn / that they may
not abide to handle or se that / which their father / or mother / or husband
/ or brother / or else their child must eat. Let them yt do so / understand
/ yt they beray and fyle their hands more / wha^ they lay them on an other man
tha^ their own husband / tha^ though they babled and blacked them in soute.
And yt it is more shame to be seen in a dau^ce tha^ in ye kechyn / and to
handle well tables and cards tha^ meat. And worse becomes a good woman to
taste a cup of drink in a feast or a ba^ket / reached unto her by an other
man / than to taste a suppynge in the kechyn to give her husband. Therefore by
my counsel a woman shall learn this craft / that she may in every time of
her life please her friends / and yt the meat may come more clenly unto the
table. I have seen in Spain and in France / that have me^ded of their sickness
by meats dressed of their wives / daughters / or daughters in law: and have
ever after loved them far the better for hit. And again I have seen / yt
have been hated / as daughter of the father and daughter in law of the father
in law / and wife of her husband / because they have said / they could not
skile of kookery.

Of the lernyng of maids. The fourth chaptre.
OF maids some be but little mete for lernyng: Like wise as some men be un
apt / again some be eue^ borne unto hit / or at lest not vnfete for hit.
Therefore they that be dulle are not to be discoraged / and those that be apt /
should be hearted and encoraged. I perceive that learned women be suspected of
many: as who says / the subtyltie of learning should be a noryshement for the
malitiousnes of their nature. Verily I do not allow in a subtle and a crafty
woman such lerny^g / as should teache her disceyte / and teache her no good
manners and virtues: Natwithstandyng the precepts of lyuy^g / and thexa^ples of
those yt have lived well / and had knowledge to gether of holiness / be ye kepers
of chastity and pureness / and the copies of virtues / and pricks to prick and
to move folks to continue in them. Aristotel asks a question / why
trompetters and mynstrelles / that play at festis for wagis / and resortynges
and gatherynges of people / whom the greeks call in their langage / as ye would
say / Bacchus servants / be ever given unto pleasures / and no goodness at
all: but spe^de out their thryfte / and their life in noughtynes. He makes
answer him self / that hit is so / because they be ever among volupteis and
pleasures / and bankettyng: nor here any time the precepts of good living: nor
regard any man that lives well: and therefore they can live none other wise
tha^ they have learned / either by seeing or heryng. Now have they hard / nor
seen / neither used any thing / but pleasure and beastlynes / among uncomely
cryeng and shouttyng / among dauncers and kyssers / laughers and eaters /
drunkerdes and spewers / among folk drowned in excedyng ouermoche joy and
gladness: all care and mind of goodness laid aparte: Therefore must they needs
show such things in their conditions and all their life. But you shall not
lyghtlye find an ill woman / except it be such one / as either knows not /
or at least way consydereth not what chastity and honesty is worth: nor sees
what myschiefe she does / wha^ she for goth it: nor regardethe how great a
treasure / for how foul / for how light / and transitory an image of
pleasure she changes: what a sort of vngratiousnessis she lets in / what
time she shuts forth chastity: nor po^dreth what bodily pleasure is / how
vain and folyshe a thing / which is not worth the turnynge of an hand / not
only unworthy: wherefore she should cast away that / which is most goodly
treasure / that a woman can have. And she that has learned in books to cast
this and such other things / and has furnyshed and fensed her mind with holy
cou^sailes / shall never fy^de to do any vilany. For if she can find in her
heart to do naughtyly / having so many precepts of virtue to keep her / what
should we suppose she should do / having no knowledge of goodness at al? And
truly if we would call tholde world to remembrance / and reherce their time /
we shall find no learned woman that ever was ill: where I could bring forth an
hundred good / as Cornelia / the mother of Gracchus / which was an example of
all goodness and chastity / and taught her children her own self. And Portia
the wife of Brutus / that took of her fathers wisdom: And Cleobula daughter
of Cleobulus / one of the.vij. wise men / which Cleobula was so given unto
learning and philosophy / that she clearly despised all pleasure of the body /
and lived perpetuallye a maid: at whom the daughter of Pythagoras the
philosopher took example / which after her fathers death was the ruler of his
schole / and was made the maystres of the college of virgins. Also Theano / one
of the same sect and schole / daughter unto Metapontus / which had also the
gift of prophecy / was a woman of syngular chastity. And saint Hieronyme
says / that the.x. Sibilles were virgins. Also Cassandra / and prophetis of
Apollo / and Juno at Cryssa / were virgins / and that was a common thing / as
we read / that those women yt were prophets were virgins eke. And she that
answered such as came to ask any thing of Apollo in Delphis / was ever a
virgin: of whom the first was Phemone / which first found verse royal.
Also Sulpitia / wife unto Caleno / left be hynde her holy precepts of
matrymony / that she had used in her living her self / of whom the poet
Martial writes on this wise:

Redeth Sulpitia all young women
That cast your mind to please one man
Redeth Sulpitia also all men
That do entende to please one woman
Of honest and virtuous love does she tell /
Chaste pastymes / plays and pleasure
Whose books who so consydreth well
Shall say / there is none holyer.
And hit is plainly known / that no man in that time was more happy of his
wife / than was Caleno of Sulpitia. Hortentia the daughter of Hortentius
thoratour / did so resemble her fathers eloquence / that she made an oration
unto the iuges of the cite for the women: which oration the successors of
that time did read / not only as a laud and preyse of women's eloquence / but
also to learn counnyng of it / as well as of Cicero or Demosthenes orations.
Edesia of the cite of Alexandre / kins woman unto Syrya^ ye philosopher / was
of so great lernyng and virtuous disposition / that she was a woundre unto all
the world in her time. Corinna Theia a virtuous woman over came the poet
Pindar.v. times in verses. Paula the wife of Senec / enfourmed with the
doctrine of her husband / followed also her husband in conditions. And Senec
him self makes sorrow / that his mother was not well learned in the precepts
of wise men / which she had been entered in at her husbands commandment.
Argentaria Polla / wit unto the poet Lucane / which after her husbands
death corrected his books / and it is said / that she helped him with the
making / was a noble woman of birth / rich and excellent of beauty and wit
/ and chastity: of whom Calliope in Statius speaks thus unto Lucane /

I shall not only give the excellence in making
But also bind in marriage the unto
One mete for thy wit and great counnyng
Such as Venus would give or the gods Juno
In beauty symplicite / and gentilnes
In birth / grace / favor / and riches.
Also Diodorus the logitia^ had.v. daughters excellent in learning and
chastity: of whom Philo / master unto Carneades / writes the historye.
zenobia the queen of palmyra / was learned both in latin and greek / and wrote
an history: of whom / with other mo in the next book / I shall tell the
maruaylous chastity. I need not to rehearse ye Christen women / as Tecla
disciple of Paul / a scholar mete for such a noble master: and Catharine of
Alexandria / daughter unto Costus / which over came in disputatio^s the
greattest and most exercised philosophers. There was one of the same name
Catharine Sene^sis a wou^drous cou^nynge maid: which has left behind her
examples of her wit: in the which does appear the pureness of her most holy
mind. Nor we need not to envy the paga^s for their poetis: which have in one
house four maids all poetis / the daughters of Philippe. And in saint
Hieronymes time all holy women were very well learned. Would god yt now a days
/ many old me^ were able to be compared unto them in counnynge. Saint
Hieronyme writes unto Paula / Leta / Eustachiu^ / Fabiola / Marcella / Furia /
Demetrias / Salma / and Hierontia: Saint Ambrose unto other: Saint Augustyne
unto other: and all marvelous wytted / well learned / and holy. Valeria Proba /
which loved her husband singularly well / made the life of our lord Christ
out of Virgils verses. Writers of cronicles say / that Theodosia / daughter
unto Theodosius the younger / was as noble by her lernyng and virtue / as by her
Empire: and ye makynges yt be taken out of Homer named centones be called hers.
I have red epistoles and counnyng works of Hildegarde / a maid of Almayne.
There has been seen in our time yt four daughters of queen Isabell / of who^
I spoke a little before / that were well learned all. It is told me with great
preyse and maruayle in many places of this country / that dame Ioanne / ye wife
of king Philippe / mother unto Carolus / yt now is / was wont to make answer
in latin / and that without any study / unto the orations yt were made after
the custom in towns / unto new princes. And like wise the Englisshemen say
by their queen / sister unto ye said dame Ioanne. The same says every body by
the other.ij. sisters / which be deed in Portugale: The which.iiij. systers
there were no queen's by any man's remembrance more chaste of body thanne
they: none of better name / none better loved of their subjects / nor more
favored: nor better loved their husbands: none that more lawelye did obey
them / nor that kept both them and all theyrs better without spotte of
vilanye: there were none that more hated fylthynes and wa^tonnes: none that
ever did more perfetly fulfill all ye po^ytes of a good woman. Now if a man
may be suffered among queen's to speak of more mean folks / I would reke^
among this sort the daughters of. S. T. M. Kn. M. E. and C. and with them
their kyns woman. M. G: whom their father not content only to have them good
and very chaste / would also they should be well learned: supposyng that by that
mean they should be more truly and surely chaste. Wherein neither that great
wise man is disceyued / nor none other that are of the same opinion. For the
study of lernyng is such a thing / ye it occupies ones mind holly / and
lyfteth it up unto the knowledge of most goodly matters: and plucketh it from
the remembrance of such things as be foul. And if any such thought come in
to their mind / either the mind / well fortified with the precepts of good
living / auoydeth them away / orels hit gives none head unto those things /
that be vile and foul: when it has other most goodly and pure pleasure /
where with hit is delyted. And therefore I suppose that Pallas the gods of
wisdom and cou^nynge / and all the Muses / were feyned in old time to be
virgins. And the mind / set upon learning and wisdom / shall not only
abhor from foul lust / that is to say / the most white thing from soute /
and the most pure from spots: But also they shall leave all such light and
tryflynge pleasures / wherein the light fantasies of maids have delight / as
songs daunces / and such other wanton and peuysshe plays. A woman says
Plutarche / given unto lernyng / will never delight in daunsynge. But here
parauenture a man would ask / what learning a woman should be set unto / and
what shall she study: I have told you / The study of wisdom: ye which
does enstruct their manners / and enfurme their living / and teaches them the
way of good and holy life. As for eloquence I have no great care / nor a
woman needs it not: but she needs goodness and wisdom. Nor it is no shame
for a woman to hold her peace: but it is shame for her and abomynable to lack
discretion / and to live ill. Nor I will not here conde^pne eloquence / which
both Quintilian / and saint Hieronyme folowy^g him say / was preysed in
Cornelia the mother of Gracchus / and in Hortentia ye daughter of Hortentius.
If there may be found any holy and well learned woman / I had leauer have her
to teach them: if there be none / let us chose some man either well aged /
orels very good and virtuous / which has a wife / and that right fair
enough / whom he loves well: and so shall he not desire other. For these
things ought to be seen unto / for as much as chastity in bringing up a
woman requires the most diligence / and in a manner all together. When she
shall be taught to read / let those books be taken in hand / that may teache good
manners. And when she shall learn to write / let not her example be void verses
/ nor wanton or tryflynge songs: but some sad sentence / prudent and chaste /
taken out of holy scripture / or the sayenges of philosophers: which by often
writing she may fasten better in her memory. And in lernyng / as I point none
end to the man / no more I do to the woman: saving it is mete that ye man have
knowledge of many and diverse things / that may both profit him self and the
common welthe / both with the use and increasynge of learning. But I would the
woman should be all together in that part of philosophy / that takes upon hit
to enfourme / and teach and amend the conditions. Finally set her learn for
her self alone and her young children or her sisters in our lord. For it
neither becomes a woman to rule a schole / nor to live among men / or speak
abroad and shake of her demurenes and honesty / either all to gether orels a
great part: which if she be good / it were better to be at home within / and
unknown to other folks. And in company to hold her tongue demurely. And let
few se her / and none at all here her. Thapostle Paul the vessel of election
/ enfurmyng and teaching the church of the Corinthis with holy precepts /
says: Let your women hold their tongues in congregations: nor they be not
allowed to speak but to be subject as the law bids. If they would learn
any thing / let them ask their husbands at home. And unto his disciple
Timothe he writes on this wise: Let a woman learn in silence with all
subjection. But I give no license to a woman to be a teacher / nor to have
authorite of ye man but to be in silence. For Adam was ye first maid / and
after Eve / and Adam was not betrayed / the woman was betrayed in to the breche
of the commandment. Therefore because a woman is a frail thing / and of weak
discretion / and that may lightly be disceyued: which thing our first mother
Eve shows / whom ye devil caught with a light argument. Therefore a woman
should not teach / lest when she has taken a false opinion and believe of any
thing / she spread hit in to the herars / by the autorite of maistershyp / and
lightly bring other in to the same error / for the lerners comme^ly do after
the teacher with good will.

What books be to be read / and What not. The.v. Chapter.
Saint Hieronyme Writing unto Leta of the teaching of Paula / commands
thus: Let her learn to here nothy^g nor speak but it that perteyneth unto the
fear of god. Nor there is no dout / but he will counsel the same of redynge.
There is an use now a days worse tha^ among the pagans / that books written
in our mothers to^ges / that be made but for idel me^ and women to read / have
none other matter / but of war and love: of the which books I thy^ke it shall
not need to give any precepts. If I speak unto Christen folks / what need I
to tell what a myschiefe is toward / when straw and dry wodde is cast in to
the fire? Yea but these be written say they / for idel folk / as though idelnes
were not a vice great enough of it self / without firebrondes be put unto it /
wherwt ye fire may catch a man al to gether and more hot. What should a maid
do with armoure? Which ones to name were a shame for her. I have herd tell /
that in some places gentyl women behold marvelous busily the plays and
iustynges of armed men / and give sentence and judgment of them: and that the
men fear and set more by their iugementes than the men's. Hit can not lightly
be a chaste mind / that is occupied with thinking on armor / and turney /
and man's valiaunce. What places among these be for chastity unarmed and
weak? A woman that uses those feats drynketh poison in her heart: of whom
this care and these words be the plain sayenges: This is a deedly sickness /
nor yet ought to be showed of me: but to be covered and holden under / lest
hit hurt other with the smell / and defile them with the infection. Therefore
when I can not tell whether it be mete for a Christen man to handle armur /
how should it be lefull for a woman to look upon them / yea though she handle
them not / yet to be conversant among them with heart and mind / which is
worse? Moreover / whereto redest thou other men's love and glosyng words / and
by little and little drykest ye entyceme^tes of yt poison unknowing / and many
times ware and wittyngly? For many / in whom there is no good mind all ready /
rede^ those books to keep him self i^ the thoughts of love: It were better
for them not only to have no learning at all / but also to lose their eyes /
that they should not read: and their ears / that they should not hear. For as
our lord says in the gospel: it were better for them to go blind and deffe
in to life / than with.ij. eyes to be cast in to hell. This maid is so vile
unto Christen folks / that she is abominable unto paga^s. Wherefore I wou^der
of the holy preachers / that when they make great a do about many small matters
/ many times / they cry not out on this in every sermon. I maruayle that wise
fathers will suffer their daughters / or that husbands will suffer their wives
/ or that the manners and customs of people will dissemble and over look / that
women shall use to read wantonness. Hit were fyttyng that common laws and
officers should not only look upon the courts and matters of suit / but also
manners both common and pryuate. Therefore hit were conuenyent by a common
law to but away foul rebaudye songs / out of the peoples mouths: which be
so used / as though nothing ought to be songen in the cite / but foul and
fylthy songs / that no good man can here without shame / nor no wise man without
displeasure. They yt made such songs seem to have none other purpose / but to
corrupt the manners of yo^ge folks / and they do none other wise / than they
that infecte the common wells with poison. What a custom is this / that a
song shall not be regarded / but it be full of fylthynes? And this the laws
ought to take heed of: and of those ungracious books / such as be i^ my
country i^ Spain Amadise / Florisande / Tirante / Tristane / and Celestina ye
baude mother of noughtynes. In France Lancilot du Lake / Paris and Vienna /
Ponthus and Sidonia / and Melucyne. In Fla^ders / Flori and White flower /
Leonell and Canamour / Curias and Floret / Pyramus and Thysbe. In England /
Parthenope / Genarides / Hippomadon / William and Melyour / Libius and Arthur /
Guye / Beuis / and many other. And some translated out of latin in to vulgar
speches / as ye unsavory co^ceytes of Pogius / and of Aeneas Siluius / Eurialus
and Lucretia: which books but idell men wrote unlearned / and set all upon
fylthe and vitiousnes: in whom I wou^der what should delight men but yt vice
pleases them so much: As for learning none is to be looked for in those men /
which saw never so much as a shadow of lerny^g them self. And wha^ they
tell ought / what delight can be in those things / yt be so plain and folisshe
lies? One kylleth.xx. him self alone / an other.xxx. an other wounded with.C.
wounds / and left deed / ryseth up again / and on ye next day made hole and
strong / over comes.ij. gyantes: and than goth away laden with gold / and
silver / and precious stones / mo tha^ a galy would carry away. What a madness is
hit of folks / to have pleasure in these books? Also there is no wit in them
/ but a few words of wantonne lust: which be spoken to move her mind with
/ whom they love / if it chance she be steadfast. And if they be read but for
this / the best were to make books of baudes crafts: for in other things /
what craft can be had of such a maker / that is ignorant of all good
craft? Nor I never hard man say / that he lyked these books: but those that
never touched good books. And I my self some time have read in them / but I
never found in them one step either of goodness or wit. And as for those yt
preyse them / as I know some that do / I will believe them / if they preyse
them after that they have read Cicero and Senec / or saint Hieronyme / or holy
scripture / and have me^ded their living better. For often times yt only cause
why they preyse them is / because they se in them their own conditions / as in
a glass. Finally / though they were never so wytty and pleasant / yet would I
have no pleasure infected with poyso^: nor have no woman quickened unto vice.
And verily they be but folisshe husbands and mad / that suffer their wives to
wax more vngratiously subtyle by redyng of such books. But whereto should I
speak of folysshe and ignorant writers / seeing that Ouide would not / that he
that entendeth to fle unchaste manners / should ones toughe the most witty and
well learned poets of the greeks and latynes / that write of love? What can be
told more pleasant / more sweet / more quick / more profitable / with all
manner of lernyng / than these poets / Calimachus / Phileta / Anacreon / Sappho
/ Tibullus / Propertius / and Gallus? which poets all Greece / all Italy / yea
and all the world sets great price by: and yet Ouide byddeth chaste folks
let them alone / saying in the second book of the Remedies of love /

Though I be loathe / yet will I say
With wanton poets se thou do not mell
Ha mine own virtues now I cast away
Beware Calimachus for he teaches well
To love / and Cous also well as he
And old Anacreon writes full wantonly
And Sappho eke often has caused me
To deal with my lady more liberally.
Who can escape fre / that redeth Tibullus /
Or Propertius / when he does sing
Unto his lady Cynthia? Orels Gallus?
And my books also sound such like thing.
They sou^de so in deed / and therefore was he banisshed / nothing without a
cause of ye good prince. Wherefore I preyse greatly the sad manners either of
that time / orelles of that prince. But we live now in a Christen country: and
who is he / that is any thing displeased with makers of such books now a
days? Plato casts out of the commonwealth of wise men / which he made /
Homer and Hesiodus the poets: and yet have they none ill thing in comparison
unto Ouidis books of love: which we read / and carry them in our hands / and
learn them by heart: yea and some schole masters teach them to their
scholars: and some make expositions and expound the vices. Augustus banished
Ouide him self / and think you tha^ that he would have kept these expositours
in the country? except a man would reken hit a worse deed to write vice than
to expound hit / and enfourme the tender minds of young folks therewith. We
banisshe him that makes false weightes and measures / and that countrefeteth
coin / or an instrument: And what a work is made in these things for small
matters? But he is had in honor / and counted a master of wisdom / that
corrupts the young people. Therefore a woman should beware of all these books /
likewise as of serpents or snakes. And if there be any woman / that has such
delight in these books / that she will not leave them out of her hands: she
should not only be kept from them / but also / if she read good books with an
ill will and loathe thereto / her father and friends should provide that she may
be kept from all redynge. And so by disuse / forgette learning / if hit can be
done. For hit is better to lack a good thing than to use hit ill. Nor a good
woman will take no such books in hand / nor fyle her mouth with them: and as
much as she can / she will go about to make other as like her self as she
may / both by doing well / and teaching well: and also as far as she may
rule by co^maundynge and chargyng. Now what books ought to be read / some
every body knows: as the gospelles / and the acts / and the epistoles of
thapostles / and ye old Testament / saint Hieronyme / saint Cyprian /
Augustine / Ambrose / Hilary / Gregory / Plato / Cicero / Senec / and such
other. But as touching some / wise and sad men must be asked counsel of in
them. For the woman ought not to follow her own judgment / lest wha^ she has
but a light entryng in lernyng / she should take false for true / hurtful instead of wholesome / folishe and peuysshe for sad and wise. She shall find in
such books as are worthy to be red / all things more wytty / and full of
greatter pleasure / and more sure to trust unto: which shall both profit the
life / and maruaylously delight ye mind. Therefore on holy days contynually /
and sometime on workynge days / let her read or here such as shall lift up
the mind to god / and set it in a christen quietness / and make the living
better. Also hit should be best before she go to mass / to read at home the
gospel and the epistole of the day / and with it some exposition / if she have
any. Now wha^ thou come from mass / and have over looked thy house / as
much as perteyneth unto thy charge / read with a quiet mind some of these that
I paue spoken of / if thou can read / if not / here. And on some workyng
days do like wise / if thou be not let with some necessary busynes in thy
house / and thou have books at hand: and specially if there be any long space
between ye holy days. For think not that holy days be ordained of the
church to play on / and to sytte idell / and talk with thy gossyppes: but
unto thentent that than thou may more intentyuely / and with a more quiet
mind / think of god / and this life of ours / and the life in heaven / that is
to come.

Of virginite. The.vi. Chapter.
Now will I talk altogeder with the maid her self: which has within her a
treasure without comparyson / that is the pureness both of body and mind. Now
so many things come unto my remembrance to say / that I wot not where is
best to begin: whether it were better to begin where as saint Augustyne
does / when he will entreat of holy virginite. All the hole Church is a
virgyn / married unto one husband Christ / as saint Paul writes unto the
Corinthis. Than what honor be they worthy to have / that be the members of
hit / which keep the same office in flesh / that the holle Church keeps in
faith / which follows the mother of her husband and lord: for ye church
is also a mother and a virgyne? Nor there is nothing that our lord delyteth
more in / than virgins: nor wherein angels more gladly abide / and play
with / and talk with: For they be virgins also them self / and their lord:
which would have a virgin unto his mother / and a virgin to his most dear
disciple / and the church his spouse a virgin. And also he maryeth unto him
self other virgins / and gothe unto marriages with virgins. And whither so ever
he goethe / that lamb without spotte / which made us clean with his blood /
an hundred and.xl. thousand virgins follow him. Hit is written in the
canticles: Our sister is a little one / and has no breasts. Whether that be
the saying of Christ or angels to ye soul / in whom stands the very
virginite pleasant unto god. Al glory of ye kings daughter is inward says
David in the psalm. There is that golden clothing / there is the garment set
and powdered with so many virtuous and precious stones. Be not proud maid that
thou art holle of body / if thou be broken in mind: nor because no man has
touched thy body / if many men have persed thy mind. What avails hit / thy
body to be clean / when thou bear thy my^de and thy thought infected with a
foul and an horrible blotte? O thou maid / thy my^de is wyddred by burning with
man's heat: nor thou fretest not with holy love: but have dried up all the
good fatnes of the pleasures of paradise. Therefore art thou the folly she maid
/ and haste no oil: and while thou rounnest to the sellar / art shut forth:
and as our lord in the gospel thretneth / when thou come again / and
knockest / thou shalt be answered: Who art thou? I know the not. Thou shalt
say than: know thou not this body closed and untouched of men? our lord
shall say again: I se not the body: I se the soul open unto men / and unto
deuylles worse than men / and often knocked at. Thou art proud maid / because
thy bealy has no cause to swelle: wha^ thy mind is swollen / not with man's
sede / but with deuylles. For here how well thy spouse lyketh the / thou
know not thy self. O most goodly of all women: come forth and follow the
steps of thy flocks / and feed thy kyddes by the tents of the herd men.
Thou know not how all only virginite is good / thou art not my spouse: come
forth / and go after the steps of those flocks / whom thou have norysshed
in thy my^de. And sith thou do not feed my kyddes / feed thy^ own: Thou
loueste not me so much / that am only the highest and the best herd man.
Tarry nere the tents of the herdmen / whom thou folowest. For if thou
folowedest me / only one herdman should be known unto the / and not many. For
he will have all to be plain and even. Thy womb swells not / nor there is no
cause why: nor let not thy mind than swelle: nor let there be no cause why.
I pray the / understand thine own goodness maid / thy price can not be
estemedde / if thou join a chaste mind unto thy chaste body / if thou shut
up both body and mind / and seal them with those seals that none can open
/ but he that has the keye of David / that is thy spouse: which rests so in
the / as in a temple most clean and goodlye. Thynkeste thou this any small
thing / that thou may receive only by pureness that thing / which can not
be comprehended in this holle world? How glad is a woman / if she bear in
her womb a child / which shall be a king? But thou bear a king all ready
not only in thy womb / but also in thy mind: which is more goodly / yea and
that such a king / in whose garment this title of dignite is written: King of
all kings / and lord of all lords: of whom prophets have prophycied: and
his reign is the reign of all worlds: whose reygne the angel told should
have none end. Let us now lift up our self above the common people: and let
us dispute this most goodly matter with saint Augustyne: but yet so that thou
may perceive us / and doubtless thou shalt perceive us better than we shall
our self. For we speak of thy goodness / which thou art not ignorant of: and
we show the that thing / that thou haste within the. The holy virgin our lady
conceived first in her mind our lord Christ / and after in her body. And it
was a more honorable / noble / and excellent thing to co^ceyue in my^de than in
body. Wherefore thou art pertener of the more excellent co^ception. O happy art
thou / that art maruelously mother unto an excellent and maruailous child. Our
lord in the gospel / when the woman said: Blessed be the womb that bare the
/ and the breasts that thou suckedest: he answered / Nay / But blessed by they
that here the word of god / and keep it. And when the Jews told him that his
mother and brethren tarried him without / he asked them: Who is my mother and
my brethren? And poyntyng his hand toward his disciples: Those be said he /
my brethren and mother / and who so else obeys the commandment of my father.
Wherefore virgins and all holy souls / engendre Christ spiritually. How be it
corporally only one virgin did bear god and man: which is spouse and also
father unto all other virgins. O thou maid / thynkest thou this but a small
thing that thou art both mother / spouse / and daughter to that god / in whom
nothing can be / but hit be thyn: and thou may with good right challenge for
thyn? For both thou gettest and art gotten and married unto him. If thou
would have a fair spouse / hit is said by him: Thou art beautyfull above
the children of man / grace is diffused in thy lyppes. If thou would have a
rich husband / thou may here said of him: Honor and riches is in his
house. If thou would have a ge^tylma^ / he is goddis son^e / and rekeneth
fourtene kings in his petegrewe / and his generations can not be expressed:
and the au^cia^te of his stock is before ye making of ye world / time
everlasting. If thou would have a mighty husband / hit is said by him: he
is wise in heart / and mighty in strength. And in ye.xliiij. psalm: Gyrde ye
with thy sword upon thy thygh most myghtyly. If thou would have a good one /
thou shalt here nothing oftener of him / than that he is the best. If thou
would have one of great possessions / thou redest of him / that all things
be subject under his fete. And in an other psalm / that all things do homage
unto him. And that not only men be subjects unto him / but also angels / and
the elements / and the heuens: which thing ye verite it self testifies of
his own self / saying: Al power is given unto me in heaven and earth. If thou
would have a wise husband / all things be naked and open unto ye eyes of
him. Nor he is not only wise / but also the very wisdom hit self: not the
wisdom of Socrates / or Plato / or Aristotel / but of god almighty: which by
that same wisdom has made and governs this world ye thou see. Now
think with what diligence this perle ought to be kept / that makes the like
unto the church / like unto our lady / sister unto angels / mother unto god /
and ye spouse of Christ / beside worldly honors / which ought to have no
place / or a very little place / in a christen bodies heart? But yet also they
as it were festyn their eyes upon a virgin. How pleasant and dear to every
body is a virgin? How reverent a thing / even unto them that be ill and
vicious them self. And among those foul and filthy goddis of the pagans /
they say that Cybele / whom they all called mother / was a virgin. And Diana
was the most favored of the goddis / because she was a perpetual virgin. Also
three things made Pallas honorable / virginite / strength / and wisdom: and
she was feyned to be bredde of Jupiters Brain / whom they called the
greatteste and prince of the goddis: of which nothing might grow / but pure
/ chaste / and wise: So that they thought virginite and wisdom were joined to
gether. And they dedicated the noumbre of seven both to chastity and wisdom:
And said that the muses / whom they called ye rulers of all sciences / were
virgins: And in the temple of Apollo Delphicus / the wise woman / which
inspired with the heavenly spirit / showed things to come unto them / that
demanded to know / was ever a virgin: whom they called always Pythia. Also
saint Hieronyme says that all the Sibylles / whom Varro says were ten in
noumbre / were virgins. At Rome there was a temple of Vesta: unto whom virgins
did mynister: which were called Vestales: and all ye Senators would rise and
reverence them / every officer gave them the way / and they were in great
honor with all the people of Rome. Virginite was ever an holy thing even
among thieves / breakers of Sayntuary / ungracious lyuers / mourdeters: and
also among wild beasts. Saint Tecla / as saint Ambrose says / altered the
nature of wild beasts with the reverence of virginite.

Virginite has so much marueylons honor in hit / that wild lions regard
hit.

Of the keeping of virginite and Chastity. The.vij. Chaptre.
How much than ought that to be setby / ye has often times defended women a
gaynst great capitaynes / tyrants / and great ostes of men? we have read of
women that have been taken and let go again of ye most unruly soudyours / only
for the reverence of the name of virginite / because they said that they were
virgins. For they iugged hit a great wickedness for a short and small image of
pleasure to mynishe so great a treasure: And every of them had leauer that an
other should be the causer of so wicked a deed than him self. O cursed maid /
and not worthy to love / the which wylly^gly spoyleth her self of so precious
a thing. Which men of war / that are accustomed to all myscheffe / yet dread
to take away? Also lovers / which be blind in the heat of love / yet they
stay and take auisement. For there is none so outrageous a lover / if he think
she be a virgin / but he will always open his eyes / and take discretion to
him and deliberation / and take counsel to change his mind. Every man is so
sore a drad to take away that / which is of so great price / that afterward
neither ca^ they their self keep / nor restore agay^e: though they shall have
no loss by ye mea^es: And the ungracious maid douteth not to lose yt / which
ones gone / she shall by no means recover again: when she has ones lost ye
greattest treasure that ever she had. And if motions of ye mind may do ought /
which if they be reasonable and honest ought to bear great rule. Let her /
that has lost her virginite / turn her which way she will / she shall find
al things sorrowful and heavy / waylyng / and mournyng / and angry / and
displeaserfull. What sorrow will her kynnes folks make / when every one shall
think them self dishonested by one shame of that maid? What mourny^g / what
tears / what weeping of the father and mother and bringers up? Do thou quite
them with this pleasure for so much care and labor? Is this ye reward of thy
bryngyng up? What cursyng will there be of her aquayntance? what talk of
neighbors / friends / and companyons / cursynge that ungracious young woman?
what mocking and babbling of those maidens / yt enuyed her before? What a
lothyng and abhorry^ge of those yt loved her? What fleyng of her company and
desertnes / wha^ every mother will keep not only their daughters / but also
their sons from the infection of such an vnchrifty maid? And woars also /
if she had any / all fle away from her. And those yt before sembled love with
her / they openly hate her: Yea and now and than with open words / will cast
the abominable deed in her tethe: that I wou^der how a young woman / seeing
this / can either have joy of her life / or live at all / and not pyne a way
for sorrow. Now whereto should I reherce the hate and anger of folks? For I
know that many fathers have cut ye throtes of their daughters / brethren of
their systers / and kynnesmen of their kynnes women. Hippomenes a great man of
Athenes / when he knew his daughter defoyled of one / he shut her up in a
stable with a wild horse / kept meateles: so the horse / wha^ he had suffered
great hou^ger long / and because he was of nature fierce / he waxed mad / and
all to tare the young woman to feed him self with. Pontius Aufidianus a roma^e
wha^ he perceived his daughter to be betrayed / unto Fannius Saturninus by her
tutour / he slew both her and the servant. Publius Attilius Philiscus slew
his daughter / because she defouled her self in aduoutry. In the same cite /
Lucius Virgineus the Centurton / because he had leauer lose his daughter / and
se her dye a good maid / than have her deflowred / slew with a sword his
well-beloved and only daughter Virginea / when he could find none other means
/ lest she should be compelled to be at the lust of ye judge. In Spain by our
fathers days in Tarraco / two brethren that thought their sister had been a
mayde^ / when they same her great with child / they dissembled their anger so
long as she was with child: but as soon as she was delivered of her child:
they throuste swords into her bealye / and slew her / the myddewyfe lokynge
on. In the same part of Spain / when I was a child / three maidens with a
long towell / strangled a mayde^ that was one of their companyons / when they
took her in the abominable deed. Histories be full of examples / and daily ye
se: neither hit is marvel that these be done of fathers and friends / and
that the affection of love and charity is turned so sodaynely in to hate: when
the women taken with the abomynable and cruel love / all love cast quite out
of their heart / hate their fathers and mothers / brethren and children: not
only their friends and aquayntance. And this I would not that only maidens
should think spoken unto them / but also married women and wydowes / and
finally all women. Now let ye woman turn to her self and consydre her own
ungraciousness / she shall fear and abhor her self: nor take rest day nor
night: but ever vexed with the scourge of her own conscience / and bourned as
hot fire brondes: shall never look stedfastlye upon any body / but she shall
be in fear / lest they know some what of her lewednes: that than no body
shall speak softely / but she shall think they speak of her vnthryftynes.
She shall never here talkyng of noughty women / but she shall think hit spoken
because of her. Nor she shall never here name of corruptyon spoken by any other
/ but she shall think hit mente by her / or of her self. Nor no body shall
stoure privily in ye house / but she shall fear / lest her ungraciousness be
opened / and that she shall be punysshed straight. What realm would thou bye
with such perpetual vexation. Which many a man supposes to be none other
pain in hell. The same pain have wicked men / but women far sorer / because
their offenses be rekened fouler / and they be more timorus of nature. And
doutles / if hit be well consydred / women be worthy these punisshmentes / and
much worse / that keep not their honesty diligently. For as for a man needs
many things / as wisdom / eloquence / knowledge of things / with
remembrance / some craft to live bye / Justice / Leberalite / lustye stomach
/ and other things moo / that were to long to reherce: And though some of
these do lack / hit is not to be disliked / so that many of them be had / but
in a woman no man will look for eloquence / great wit / or prudence / or
craft to live by / or ordryng of the commen weal / or justice / or
liberalite: Finally no man will look for any other thing of a woman / but her
honestye: the which only / if hit be lacked / is like as in a man / if he
lack al yt he should have. For in a woman the honesty is instead of all. Hit
is an evil keeper / that can not keep one thing well / committed to her keeping
/ and put in trust to her with much commendation of words: and specially
which no man will take from her against her will / nor touch hit / except she
be willing her self. The which thing only / if a woman remember / hit shall
cause her to take better head / and to be a more ware keeper of her goodness:
which alone / though all other things be never so well in saftye / so lost
/ all other things perysshe to gether there with. What can be safe to a woman
says Lucrecia / when her honesty is gone? And yet had she a chaste mind in a
corrupt body. Therefore as Quintilian says / she thrist a sword in to her
body / and avenged the co^pulsyon / yt the pure mind might be separated from
the defiled body / as shortly as could be. But I say not this because other
should follow the deed / but the mind: By cause she that has ones lost her
honesty / should think there is nothing left. Take from a woman her beauty
/ take from her kynrede / riches / comelynes / eloquence / sharpenes of wit /
counnynge in her craft / give her chastity / and thou haste given her all
things. And on that other side / give her all these things / and call her a
noughtye pack / with that one word thou haste taken all from her: and have
left her bare and foul. There be also other things / both in the body and
mind / that help a woman unto the keeping of her honesty: whereof I will
speak now.

Of the ordryng of the body in a virgin. The.viij. Chaptre.
THough hit were not for this purpose to speak of the body / not withsta^dyng
for as much as some things that be in ye mind come of the reason and
complexion of the body. Therefore must we speak some thing of ye ordryng of
the body of a virgin. First of all me thy^ke that it is to be told their
father and mother / as Aristotel does bydde in his history of beasts / that
is that they keep their daughters / specially when they begin to grow from
chyldes state / and hold them from men's company. For that time they be given
unto most lust of the body. Also the maidens should keep them self / both at
all other / and at ye time specially / from either herynge or seeing / or yet
thinkyng any foul thing / which thing she shall labor to do. Never the less
at other times two / and unto the time that they be married / much fasting
shall be good / which does not feeble the body / but brydell hit / and press
hit down / and quench the heat of youth. For these be only the very and
holy fastes. Let their meat be mean and easy to get / neither hot of
hitselfe / nor spised with spices / nor delycate. And they ought to remember /
that our first mother for meat was cast out of paradise. And many young women
that had been used to delycate meats / when they had not them at home / have
gone forth from home and ieoperded their honesty. Let their drink be the
drink prepared of nature / that is clean water. Valerius Maximus says / that
wine was unknown unto women of Rome in old time / lest they should fall in
any shame. For because it was wont to be the next way from Bacchus the
father of intemperance unto Venus unlawful. But if their stomach will not bear
water / give them some ale / or bear / or small wine / as shall be sufficient
to digest their meat / and not inflame their bodies. Nor that is not only good
for their manners and rankenes of ye body / and wantonness / to keep them under
/ but also shall keep better their health. I have read in an epistole of saint
Hieronyme unto Furia in this manner. Physicians and such as write the natures
of me^nes bodies / and specially Galene in the book of Health says / that the
bodies of children and young men / and those that be in lusty age / both men
and women / be very hot of natural heat: and that all meats that increase
heat / be very noisome for them: and that it is good for them to use all
cold thing in meats and drynkes: As in contrary wise unto old men / and
such as be full of fleme and cold / hot meats and old wine be best.
Wherefore our savior says: Take you head to your self that your hertes be not
over commen with surfeit and dronkennes / and the cares of this life. And the
apostle says: wine / in whom is lecherye. Neither hit is wonder that he that
made the vessel did perceive this by the vessel / that he made. Where Terence
/ whose intent was to discribe and show the conditions of the world / said
thus: without meat and drink courage waxes cold. Therefore first if their
stomach be strong enough / take water in thy wine or drink / until thy
maids years be past: and such water as is most cold. And if thou may
not for feebleness / myngle it as Timotheus did / with a little wine for thy
stomach and wekenes. Than in meat eschew all hot thing. I speak not only
of flesh / where of the vessel of election saint Paul speaks this sentence
/ saying: Hit is good to eat no flesh nor drink no wine: but also of pulse
/ all those that be full of wind and heuye should be eschewed. And a little
before: what needs hit us for to boste our chastity / which without hit have
all beside that apperteyneth / as abstine^ce and small fare / it can not bring
proffe of hit self. The apostle werieth his body / and subdueth hit unto the
commandment of the mind / lest he should not keep that him self / which he
byddeth other to do. Than how can a yo^ge woman / that has a body hot with
meat be sure of her self? Nor I co^de^pne not with these words meats yt god
has ordained to use with surrendryng of thanks: But I take from young men /
and maidens the kendlyng of lust. For neither the burning Etna / nor the
country of Vulcane / nor Veseuus / nor yet Oly^pus boyleth with such heat as
the bodies of yo^ge folks enflamed with wine and delycate meats / done. All
this have I brought in of saint Hieronyme / yt you might know what things
that master of chastity did teach: which writy^g unto Saluina / had leauer
ieoparde the health of the body tha^ ye soul / saying: Hit is better that ye
stomach ache / than the mind / and to rule the body than to do hit service /
and stagger in going than in chastity. The most holy man Gregorius Nazanzenus /
that was saint Hieronymis master / would yt his maid should alay her hunger
with bred / and quench her thyrst with water. Hilarious the heremite / when he
lived in wyldernes with small food / scantly preseruyng the life / and yet
felt him self diverse times pryckedde with the bodily lust / he weried his
body with fasting / saying: I shall tame the concupiscence / to make the
think upon thy meat / and not upon thy pleasure. And this say the disciples
of Christ / ye fellows of saint Paul / being given unto sobre and chaste
religion: As who knew / that the noryshementes of holy men sent by ye grace
of god / were but simple and small to content nature / without any pleasures.
Helise norisshed him self and the children of the prophets with wild herbs
/ and he byddeth / make sweet the bitter meat with flower / and not with
sugar. And he commanded the soudiours in Samaria / of whom he had put out the
eyes / to be fed with bredde and water. John^ the Baptist / that was chosen
ye shewer of Christ and ye light to come / was fed in deserte with grashops
and wyld honey. Habacuch carried the meat of the reapers unto Daniell in Babylon
/ which was bread baken under the ashes / and a cup of water was sent unto
Helie from heaven to refreshe him with: and yet might god have sent from heaven
partryges / and phesauntes / and capons / and march payns / as well as bread:
but holy folks need norisheme^t to hold the soul in the body / and not to
drown hit with. What say philosophers / and ye masters of worldly wisdom /
al speak of meat that is easy to get / to keep the mind sobre and the body
chaste. Socrates the father of Philosophy did get by sobre diet / that he was
never infected with any sore or ieoperdous sickness. Also Cornelius Tacitus
writes / that Senec the philosopher in all his riches fed him self with
fruit and water: and therefore his body was brought so low / that wha^ his
veins were opened / there would almost no blood re^ne out. How trow you that
Xenocrates lived / which when his scholars had laid him a goodly queen in his
bed / and was much provoked of her unto lust / yet he was not moved? Plato
in his laws forbyddeth young men wine. Cicero in his officis would have all
the living and arraye of the body / to be taken to the health and strength /
and not for pleasure. And he says also / if we would co^sydre what excellence
and dignite is in the nature of man / we should understand / how great shame
hit is to waste hit away riottouslye / and to lead the life delycately and
deliciously: and how honest it is to live chastely / sobrely / sadly / and
measurably. This says Cicero. Also Duidius / gyuynge remedy of love / byddeth
them that shall live chastely also to live temperately / and eschew such meat
as moves the body to lust / and wynes specially / and to bring such to the
table as refrain the lust of the body. When I speak of hot meats / I
would be understand in such exercises also / that heat the body / and of
oyntmentes / spices / talkyng and also sight of men. For all these be hurtful
unto the chastity: for they fire the mind with fylthy and ieoperdous heat.
Nor let not your bed be very soft / but clean: the which thing also is to be
regarded in clothes / that they be not over delicate / but without fylthe and
without spotte: and lightly the mind reioyseth in the clenlynes of the body.
And again / a deynty and a delycate mind deliteth in sylkes and costely
clothes: and what so ever is not such / hit counts hard and grievous.
Gregorius Nazanzenus forbyddeth maids to wear gold and perle. What a folly is
it / to wene yt these words of our savior Christ ( Ecce qui mollibus
vestiuntur / in domibus regum sunt / that is to say / Lo / they that be clothed
in delicate clothes / be in kings houses) should be understood on this wise:
that those / which be in the company of Christen ky^ges / should be clothed
with fine and costely clothy^g? Christis faith knows no courts / nor kings:
in the which court we here these words: Kings of paganes have dominion over
them: and they that have power upon them be called beneficial / but you shall
not be so / but let the most of you be as the leest / and the master as a
minyster. Christis faith is holy and sad: and as the yocke of hit is easy /
pleasant / and sweet unto the soul / and wherein the soul finds rest: so is
hit heavy and peynefull unto the pleasures of the body. Nor let not a maid
sleep over long / and yet sufficient for her health / the which we provide
for on this wise / that they shall fare better that follow this sobre dyette of
ours / than they that follow pleasures and delycates: unto which pleasures who
so is given / we se be pale and consumed. And beside all this / is some labor
to be given / and some occupation mete for a virgin / as I have rehearsed. For
the deuylles subtilte never comes more sooner tha^ in idelnes: nor Venus never
uses her crafts more redely in any other casis: and that not only in women /
but also in men: which be more steadfast and constant. Ouide the crafts man
of handlyng love / determines / that Egisthus set his mind to defoule
Clytemnestra the wife of kind Agamemnon / and to kill Agamemnon him self /
for none other cause / but because he was slothful. Therefore in the remedies
of love / this is one of the chief precepts / that the darte of Cupide take
us not idell. For he says /

If thou will banyshe idelnes /
Cupides bows on the shall have no might:
And also his hot fire brondes
Sall lie quenched deuoyde of light.
Saint Hieronyme cou^saileth ye holy virgin Demetrias to eschew idelnes. And
therefore wha^ she has done her prayers / to go in hand with wolle and weauyng
/ that by such change of works ye days seem not long. Nor he bad not / yt
she should work / because yt she was in any pouerte: which was one of ye most
noble women in Rome / and rychest / but yt by the occasion of workyng / she
should think on no thing / but such as perteyneth unto ye service of our
lord. Which place he ends in this wise. I will speak generally nothing
shall be specially p^cious in Christis sight / but hit yt you make thy self /
either for thy^ own use / or ensample of other virgins / or to give unto thy
grand mother / or thy mother: no not though you deal all thy goods unto pour
folks. And verily so hit is / for she that will be idel / or also given to
play / and passing of her life in pleasures / is not worthy to have her meat
in the church of Christ: in the which saint Paul the greattest preachour of
Christ cries / and pronounces as a law: who that laboreth not / let them
not eat? this is the common pain of mankind / given unto them for the first
offense of our aunciant father Adam: thou shalt eat thy bredde in the swette
of thy face. And doubtless those that be subject unto this general pain /
when they offend and sin no less tha^ other / they shall have an other
pain / either sorer / or else no less. Now saying that I have bid / that
women's minds should be occupied / either with work / orels holy study and
communication / lest they fall in to vice by idelnesse: what should we think
by them yt play at cards or dice / which manner of pastime / wha^ hit is
foul in a man / in a woman hit is to be abhorred? What can a woman learn / or
think / playeng at the dice? the mind must needs be altered and turned all to
covetousness / that is of hit self inclined there unto / and after fall to
pariury / for gredines of ye money. Also on ye other side / if men be there she
shall here many things uncomely for a woman to here. What a foul thing is hit
/ to se a woman / instead of her wolbasket / to handle the table bourde / for
her spindell / the dyce / and for her clewe or prayer book / to turn the
cards? There is no wise man / but he had leauer se her idell / than so
occupied. Nor there is no wise man / but he will curse both her that lerneth
such things / and him that taught hit her / and them that suffered them.

Of the raymentes. The.ix. Chaptre.
HIt seems to apperteyne unto the same place / to entreat of the other
ornaments of ye body: First of peyntyng. Verily I would feign know / what the
maiden means / that peynteth her self: if it be to please her self / it is
a vain thing: if it be to please Christ / it is a folly: if hit be to delight
men / hit is an ungracious deed. Thou haste but one spouse / and to please him
with / make thy soul gay with virtue / and he shall kiss the for thy beauty.
But parauenture thou sekeste some man to be thy spouse / and would please him
with peyntyng: First I shall show the / how folisshe a thing hit is / and
than how ungracious. Me think hit much like / if thou will go about to win
them with payntynge / as though thou would entise or attempt him with a
viser: whom when thy viser is ones of / thou shalt make as much to loathe
the / as thou madeste to like the / when hit was on. Thou art but in il case /
if thou have nothing else to please him with / that shall be thy husband / but
only peyntyng: how shall thou please him / wha^ thou lackest thy peyntyng?
Except thou will never wasshe out that cruste / but go so with a crust of
peyntyng to bed / and so rise / and be so with in and a broad among folks.
And more over / what a pain is hit to entende that peynty^g for any body / and
not only for the to kept hit hole still? What a shame is hit / if any water by
chance light on hit / or the peyntynge fortune to melte by thoccasion of swette
or heat / and show the very skin? there can nothing be more filthy to se
to. And who I pray you / will count them to be feyze / that he knows to be
slubbered with peyntyng / and not rather the fouler? They lose all the honor
of beauty / wha^ they be peynted. For all the beauty / that there is / is
counted to be in ye peyntyng. And also the tender skin will reuyll the more
soon / and all the favor of the face waxes old / and the breath stynketh /
and the tethe rusten / and an yuel air all the body over / both by the
reason of the ceruse / and quick silver / and specially by the reason of the
sopis / where with they p^pare the body / as it were a table / against the
peyntyng on ye next day. Wherefore Ouide called these doings venomes / and not
without a cause. Also Iuuenall asks a question properly: She that is with so
many oyntementes slubbered and starched / is hit to be called a face or a sore?
The which things I would more largely entreat / but that I am borne i^ that
Cite / where as the women have a vile name for this thing: and in my mind not
without a cause. I will rebuke mine own country / which is to me the most
dear / that for shame it may leave. Now if thou can not else be married / hit
is better never marie / than toffende Christ for it / and be married to some
folisshe man / that shall have more delight in thy peyntynge than in thy self.
For what hope can thou have in that man / that has more delight in a cruste
of white Ceruse / than in an honest woman? God has given the a face after the
image of his son: nor he has not given hit nakedde: For he has inspired the
spirit of life / that the image of his life / and all thing may appear in
hit. Why than do thou over cover hit with dirte and mire? The apostle Paul
byddethe a man not to cover his heed / because hit is the image of god: what
will he say of the image of god in a womans face / so fyled with that mire? And
because no man shall reken hit as a bourde / Saint Hieronyme against Heluidius
writes in this wise: She that is peynted by a glass / and in dispite of him
that made her / she gothe a bout to be fayrer than she is borne. And unto
Furia. What does purpurice or ceruse in a Christen bodies face / of whom the
one countrefaiteth the rudde of precious stones in the lyppes / the other
whitnes of face and neck / which is a fire unto yo^ge men / and a fome^t of
lechery / and insamples of unclean minds? How can she weep for her sin / yt
must bare her skin there with / and forowe her face? This apparel is not the
coueryng of our lord / hit is the cover of Antichrist. How dare she lift up
toward heaven that face / ye her maker will not know? This says saint
Hieronyme. Now here ye holy marter saint Cypria^. Goodly apparel and clothyng
do not agree but for harlottes and comen women: nor none has lightly more
precious apparel than they that set no price by their honesty and goodness.
And in the scripture / that god would have us instruct withal and taught / the
cite is discrybed an harlot / piked and apparelled goodly / that shall perish
together with her apparel: and specially because of her apparel. Now what a
madness is to delight in that / which ever has done hurt / and hurts still:
and to wene that thou shalt not perisshe because of ye / whereby thou know
that other have perisshed. For god made neither purple / nor cry^sin sheep /
nor taught to die with the iuce of herbs: neither fine silks enbrobred with
gold / perles / or precious stones / to hide the neck in / which he made:
and to hyde ye / which god made in man: and show that / which the devil
has found out and his dampened angels / when they fell from the heavenly
virtue unto the erthly co^tagiousnes: tha^ they taught to peynt the black of
eyes / and ruddines of chekes / and alter the natural color of the hears and
visage. And verily me think that for the dread that our faith teaches us /
and for the love that broderhodde requires / not only maids / but also
wydowes and wives / should be warned / ye and all women in general / that the
work of god ought not to be defiled with yelowe / or black / or read colors
/ laid on hit. For god said: Let us make man after our own image and lykenes.
Now than / how dare any he so bold to change that / which god has made? For
they lay violent hand on god him self / when they go about to reform and
change / that which he has made / not knowing / that all thing natural is
the work of god: and all that is by alteration / is the work of the devil:
Is if a counnyng peynter had peynted any bodies picture cou^nyngly / expressyng
both the form and qualities of the body / than if an other come and laid to
his hand / as though he would amend hit / should not he greatly dismaye and
offend the first workman? Than wenest thou to escape unpunished / that
offendest god / the workman of thy body? For though thou be not an adulterar
toward men / yet when thou corruptest and marrest that / which is goddis
doing / thou art a worse adulterar: And where thou thynkest thy self gay and
well picked / that is a strife against goddis work and breaking of truth.
Thy loroe says / thou canste not make one white hear or black / and
thynkeste thou thy self able to overcome ye word of thy lord? Thou die thy
hear by a bold presumption and ungracious co^tempte: and before hand thou
signifiest thy hear to be flamed / and ungoodly sinnest with the better part
of the / that is thy heed. These be saint Cyprians words. Also after these
p^ceptes of Christian men / I am a shamed to rehearse ought out of pagans. I
will lay to only one of the most wiseman Lycurgus / the maker of the laws of
the Lacedemons: which when he would have women of his country to be regarded
by their virtue / and not their orname^tes / he banisshed out of the country by
the law all peyntyng / and commanded out of the town all crafty men of
pykynge and apparellyng. Our lord shows by Osee ye prophet / that the woman
/ which fell unto adultery / apparelled her self with ouches and brouches /
that she might go wait upon me^ / and not her lord. And if thou apparel thy
self for god and good folks / thou art fair enough / wha^ thou art good: but
thou can not please the devil / and ill people / except thou mynisshe much
of thy natural fayrenes. What should all that gold do to be worn / as though
thou would she we how strong thou art that canste bear so much weyghte?
Weneste thou to seem feyrer / nobler / or wyser / if thou have so much metal
upon the. Nay / never a whit. What than / thou will say parauenture / I shall
seem the rycher. O veins of myde / is that a thought or a saying of a christian
my^de? Thou cariest so much gold about thy neck / yt does no good / wha^
thou deniest a halfpeny unto them yt have need / and be an hu^gred: and robbest
thy neighbors / and perauenture thy householde / thy children / and thy
husband / that the beams of gold and precious stones shynyng may dare the
eyes of them / that be hold the. Is this Christian charity? Dyddest thou swear
this in thy baptyme / wha^ thou sayddest / that thou for sokeste Satanas and
all his pomp? And yet what pomp of Satanas is there / but thou use it more
superfluously / tha^ does any pagane? Look well on thy self: Thou shalt find
thy self one of Satanas officers / that use at home so many chosen meats to
the full / bulkynge out capons / pertryges / phesantes / delicate cakes /
potages / sauses / and soppes / and all costly / among so many of thy pour
neighbors / that die for hunger: thou that lyuest in pleasures among so many
labors / and pains of thy neighbors: thou that go in sylkes / and fine
garments among so many naked: thou that art so goodly to se to among so
many beggars: Art thou the disciple of pour Christ / of that facio^? Nay nay /
thou art rather ye disciple of rich Pluto. I would not you should go bare
necked / nor I would not have ye to excedy^gly covered / to make a show of hit.
Follow Christ / by whom thou have pleasure to be named: follow his sobre and
measurable mother / whom men now honor as their lady / and deuylles dread /
and saints worsshippe: whose outward garment was course clothe and easy to
get: and the inner clothyng / that is to say her heart and mind / gilted with
gold / and set with precious stones. Thou can not be gold of both parties:
chose which thou will have / thy body or thy soul golden. I can not rehearse
al ye longs to this matter: yet will I speak of smelles some things. A
Christen mind does not preyse uncleanliness and stynke: for Mary Magdalene
poured upon ye heed of our lord oyntme^t of precious spike: where of all the
house smelled: nor that was not unpleasant unto our lord: but these
superfluous savors / and fome^tes of the body / which the more hit is
cherisshed / the more hit ryseth and rebelleth against the soul / and like a
tyrant rules all the man / and draws al unto vile fantasy / where the seat
is of his delicatnes. Saint Hieronyme writes unto Demetrias the virgin / Let a
maid audyde / as a mischefe or a poison of chastity / yo^ge men with hedes
busshed and trimmed / and swear smelling skins of out landisshe myse.
Wherefore this saying of the poet arbiter was spoken:

He is not like to sauer well
That ever has a good smell.
Alyke saying has Martial.

I had leauer have no smell
Than to sauer ever well.
And Plautus sayethe / A woman ever smellethe best wha^ she smells of
nothing. But here parauenture some dangerous dame would answer / that with
her quick answers has gotten a name of wisdom: we must do some thy^g for
our birth and gentle blood / and possessions. But what art thou / that so
say / a christian or a pagane? If thou be a pagane / I will not argue with
the: if thou be a christen woman / wite thou well / thou proud woman / that
Christ knows no such difference: that is a point of a deuillysshe pride /
and not of a christian mind. See thou not / how that is none apparel / but
fedynge of thy pride? Hit is an old saying and a true: No be is prouder
than a woman well apparelled. Than will thou say / we must needs do some thing
for thuse of the world and customs? Now would I know / whose custom must
be followed: if thou name me wise men / I grant: if thou say of foles / why
should they be followed but of foles? And Quintilia^ says / thaggrement and
concente of good folks ought to be called an use. Parauenture there is an
evil custom brought up / be thou the first to lay hit down / and thou
shalt have the preyse of hit / and other shall follow thyn ensample. And as ye
ill ensample is brought in of ill folks and stablished: so of good folks hit
shall be put away / and good brought up. Than if we must ever follow the customs
of the world / we shall never amend / but ever wax worse: for than shall one
find an ill use / and none may put hit away. Now whose is that custom / ye
thou talkest of / and of whom was hit taken? Of pagans women. Why do not we
tha^ keep still our paganes law? For if thou list be called Christen / use
manners according there unto. She is a pagane / and knows not god / nor the
temperance of living: And thou that know god / and art christened / what
do thou more tha^ she? What mentest thou by that that thou renunceddest
Satanas with all his pomp / when thou do not only match the pagane in
Satanas pomp / but also passest her? Nor yet thou folowest not those sad and
holy pagans / but the most lewd / and light / and full of riotte / vice /
and mischeffe. Nor thou folowest not the women of Lacedemon / that were so
honest / whose queen / ye wife of Lysandre / and her daughters / wha^
Dionysius the king of Syracuse sent them rich robes / they answered and said:
They shall do us more shame than honor. Nor thou folowest not the women of
Rome / that were in old time / unto whom when king Pyrrhus sent his
ambassador with silver / and gold / and kercheffes of sylke / there was none
so desirous or gredy of apparel or so vnthryftily my^ded / to take any. Quinta
Claudia / a religious virgin / was reputed for a mys woman / because she used
to wear gaye raiment. There was in Rome / after the secunde war against ye
Carthagina^s / a law called Opius law / that no woman should wear over half
a nounce of gold: nor wear no diverse colored clothing. Which law endured
until the great outrageous superfluite came in to ye city / when women came
runnynge forth / as though they had be mad / asking a license to wear what
they list. But Marcus Cato / ye great wise man / gave counsel contrary /
with an oration full of wisdom: and.ii. Tribunes spoke for them: whose folisshe
and feeble orations be rehearsed in Liute ye historiographer. But ye women
overcame with their importunite and business / that the bryddel of their pride
might be let slyppe / that they might do what they lust: Whereof what hurt
should come Cato told before: and as in many of his other sayenges / like wise
in yt he was a true prophet. For what man can tell / how great a loss is of
chastity / caused by this striuynge for apparelle / when every one is ashamed
to be over come of her fellow in rayme^t? And wha^ they be trymmed and dekked /
than desire they to go forth among men to show them self. And there in is
the ship wrack of chastity. Plutarchus says / that it is a custom in
Egypt / that women should wear no shows / because they should abide at home.
Like wise if thou take from women sylke / and cloth of gold / and silver /
precious stones / and gemmes / thou shalt the more easily keep them at home.
Also he reherseth.ij. sentences / the one of Sophocles the poet / and the other
of Crates the philosopher. Sophocles speaks of rich orname^tes thus: That is
none ornamene you wretch / but a shame and a manifest show of thy folly. Crates
says / that is an ornament / which exalts: and a woman is exalted with
that / which makethe her more honest: But that doethe neither gold / nor
perle / nor pourple / but such things / as be signs of grauite / sobrenes
and chastity. Democrates says, that the adoruament of a woman stands in
scarsite of speech and apparel: In which opinion Sophocles is. And among the
Greeks this was a common saying / and in a manner of a proverb: The adornamet
of a woman is not gold / but conditions. Also Aristotell / the most wise
philosopher / byddeth women use less apparel than the law suffers: and he
byddeth them consydre / that neither ye goodlynes of apparel / nor ye
excellence of beauty / nor thabundaunce of gold is of so great estemation in
a woman / as is measurablenes and dylygence to live well and honestly in all
things. And of the same opinion be the other wise men of ye pagans / that a
christen woman may be a shamed to follow pagans / not those sage and wise men
/ nor those virtuous and honest women / but the error of foles and ensample of
mad women: and I confess / that I can not tell what honest color women may
lay for their apparel / but only that they may seem fayrer / and entise men /
which were a shame / ye for gentyles. Therefore thou both seruest thy pride /
and set the deuylles nets in thy body / to catch with all the souls of
them / that behold the: thou woman / not a Christian / but the mynister of
the devil / ye fell thretny^g of our lord displeased with ye / shall be
pronunced upon the / saying by Esaie ye prophet: Our lord has made balde the
hedes of ye daughters of Syon / and instead of ornament they shall have shame
/ and for their shows / and slyppers / and cheyns / precious stones /
pommanders / and glasses / and sweet savors / they shall have stynke: and for
their gyrdels / they shall have ropes: and for their crispe hear / they shall
have balde patis. These words our lord said of women. And this holy martyr
saint Cyprian says: There be some rich women and habundant in goodis / which
bear their treasure on them / and say they must use their goods. First let
them know / that she is rich / that is rich in god: and she is habu^da^t of
possessions / that is habundant in Christ: and those be good that be
spiritual / divine / and heuenlye / which shall abide with us in perpetual
possession. But and thou array thy body sumptuously / and go gayly forth
abroad / and entyse the eyes of them ye behold the / and draw the sight of
young men after the / and nourisshe ye lust of concupiscence / and fire and
kendle the smell of sin / in so much that though thou perysshe not thy
self / yet thou shall cause other to perisshe / and make thy self as a
poysoner and a sword unto them that se the: thou can not be excused as
chaste in mind: thy^ evil and unchaste raiment shall reprove the: neither
thou canste not be counted among maidens and virgins of Christ / that so
lyuest ye men shall love the mordinatly. Thou bostest thy possessions and
virginite: but a virgin should not bost her riches / seeing that holy scripture
says: What has pride auayled us? Or what good has the bost of riches done
us? All they be passed as a shadow. Thou say you art rich / and thynkest
that thou must use those that god would thou should have / use them, why not?
But yet in goodness and good ways / use them / in such things as god
commanded / and as our lord taught: Let them feel thy riches that have need:
let them know the to be of power: get wynnynges unto Christ of thy patrimony:
feed god. This says ye martyr saint Cyprian. Which things are a great deal
better for a christen woman to know and do / than that the paga^s do: and hit
were mete for them to take heed unto the philosophers / and not to follow ye
deeds of foles / and apply unto the fantasies of mad folks: except we would
spend our life madly and folishly. But here some man would say: what / would
thou have women to be fylthy and sluttysshe? Nay verily / I would not have them
so: nor my precepts be not so unclean: nor I like not sluttishnes. And what
manner a ones they should be / saint Peter and saint Paul.ij. defenders of the
church / teach in.ij. short precepts. Saint Peter says: Let not ye
outward apparel of women be decked with the braydynge of her hear / nor with
wrappynge of gold about hit / or goodly clothing: but the mind and the
conscience / that is not seen with eyes / if hit be pure and quiet / that is a
goodly thing / and excellent before god. And saint Paul says: women in their
arraye should apparel them self with shamfastnes and sobrenes: and not with
braydes of their hear / or gold / or perles / or precious clothy^g: but as
women ought to do: Let them show virtue by good works. When the apostles say
these words / they bid not women be sluttisshe and slubbered / nor foul with
dirte and clowtes: but they counsel them from superfluous raiment / and will
them to use mean clothing / and such as is easy to comeby. For mesurablenes
has his clennes / and that far more pure than the great excess has / as
hit is more easy to keep a little vessel tha^ a great meyny. Let her not be
clothed with velvet / but with woollen: nor with sylke / but lynnen / and that
course. Let not her raiment shine / ne let it not be sluttisshe: neither let
hit not be to be wondered on: nor let hit not be to be lothed: as for ye wearyng
of gold / or silver / or perle / or precious stones / I se not what hit is
good for / saving that the virtue of some stones is more set by than the
show / as coral or emeraude: if at lest way those little things have so
much virtue in them as men say: but now mo seek them for vanite / that he may
seem more rich / than for the virtue. Nor let her not peynte nor anoint her
face / but wasshe hit and make hit clean: nor dye her hear / but kome hit
clenly: Nor let her not suffer her heed to be full of scurfe: Nor let her not
delight to wash it in sweet favors: nor to keep hit stynkynge: nor look in a
glass to peynte her or try^me her gayly by: but to have away / if any foul
thing or uncomely be on her heed / that she could not else se: and tha^ let her
array her self thereby / lest any thing be in her face to defoule her / being
else chaste and sobre. Finally that which Socrates bad his scholars / let her
think spoken unto her to / yt they should look them in a glass / and if they
were fair / that they should se lest ye mind were foul: and if they were
foul / that with the beauty of the mind they should cou^trepeyse the
deformite of body. Moreover / let an honest maid remember still / that
beauty has brought many of them yt have had hit / in great pride: and many
of them that have seen hit / in to abominable sin. Wherefore many holy women
have labored to seem less fair tha^ they were. As for this needs not to bid
I suppose / that a woman shall use no man's raiment / else let her think she
has the man's stomach / but take heed to the words of our lord / saying: A
woman shall not put on man's apparel: for so to do is abhomynable before god.
but I trust no woman will do hit / except she be paste both honest and
shame.

Of the living alone of a virgin The.x. Chapter.
HOly writers say that death gothe in to the soul by the senses of the body
like wyndowes: except a man be wisely ware. Folks be tolled and enticed with
the pleasures of ye world: where with also the soul is caughte and holden.
Therefore a maid should go but seldom abroad: because she neither has any
busynes forth / and standethe ever in ieopardye of her chastity / the most
precious thing that she has. And let her wait upon her mother / not only
when she gothe forth / but also at home: Which thing their mothers must
also be charged with. Saint Hieronyme counsayleth Leta / that when she gothe to
her manner place in the country / she do not leave her daughter in her house
within the cite: let her not can tie may to live without you says he: and
wha^ she is alone / let her fear* Which saying I would have thus understood
/ that ye mother should take her daughter away with her / if she tarry any
whiles. For else it is no need to take her daughter with her / as often as she
goth forth: and specially if she go to any feastis / or maryages / or metynge
of men / or any other like place / that she must go to / or to fulfill her
husbands pleasure: Where hit is not mete for the daughter to go: and let there
be at home some good woman keeper of her chastity. For there is no greatter
myschiefe than that that is bredde at home / nor more ieoperdous. How shalt
thou avoid yt / except thou eschew hit utterly? What avails it to save the
wod from all harm / when there is a worm with in / that eats hit? I know a
very good woman / which was made the ouersear of maids / that would not
correct / and take away her sons / wha^ they playde some what wantonlye with
wenches / because she loved them some what tenderly / nor keep from harming of
their chastity. Wherefore hit is to be taken head of: that the woman / whom the
maid is put in trust to / have no wanton sons / nor bredren: whom she dare
not be against. Let her not be only chaste / but also in countenance and
grauite / both of wisdom / manners / and speech / worthy to be had in
reverence: Whose eyes and look they will be aferde of and not only their speech:
ye and though they be her elder brethren / that she fear nothing in doing her
duty of watch and keeping: So that she make all thing belo^gynge unto her
chastity / safe with her presence: and such as would toll them unto wantonness
and vice / with her exsample is for to be driven far away. But she that will be
hired of a lover to provoke to move with speech and words / lacks the name
of a reasonable creature: For that is a deuyllysshe thing: Which a maid shall
flee fro / like as she would from an edder or a serpent: which all folks
should drive out of ye country / as a commen destruction of them all. Hit can
not be told / how much myschiefe such women be cause of. Therefore let not a
maid ones abide the sight of such women: For they be very cocatryces: and
inspire poison with their look / and slay with the only beholding. Nor let any
man think that I speak this as a similitude beyond the very truth: For
some be so craftye / that they can catch one with a look / without words: and
some use inchaunteme^tes and charms: Where of there be many examples. Also
with the only look and saluty^g / this serpent casts a blotte on the young
woman / unto whom she speaks and looks / namely there as such a woman is
known: beside the shame that she causes in that house / that she resorteth
unto. Therefore let the maid fire unto her mother / as unto a sainctuary / and
schewe unto her / what that ungracious body would have done: orels so avoid
and keep her self from her / that they that se it / may perceive by her chere
/ that she fears the myscheuousnes of that woman: and so she shall do her
self good / with the deed / and other with her example: wha^ she shows other
maids / what they ought to fear in that woman. Hit were good for ye common
wealth / that inquisition were made of old poor women / that the ruler of the
cite might know how they get their living. Also of the servants saint
Hieronyme says / I would she should love none of her maids more than an other
/ in whose ear she should use to rowne and title often. What so ever she say
the to one / let all here hit: Let her be content with a maid not pyked / and
fair / and wanton / that can sing a balade with clear voice: but sad / pale /
and vntrymmed. Also he says unto Demetrias: Se that none of her fellows do her
harm / either with nyce rayme^t / or wanto^ words. Have naught to do with
such women / that have pleasure to be seen / and loved / and make their boste
/ that they have such a fair lover / or rich / or noble: and bears about
letters sent from him / and other while shows them unto their companions /
or tell his deeds / or rehearse his words: this he did / this he said to me:
thus he comes to me / thus he preysed me: avoid them away / be they never
so nere neighbors / be they never so rich / be they friends / kyns folks /
alyans / yea though they be thy systers / refuse them: For they be bytte^ of ye
wood dog the devil: and be fallen wood their self: Wherein there is no
name so dear / that should or ought to bring a maid to their company / but
rather the mother should kylle the child / and the sister the brother / and
the brother the sister / and sister the sister / and brother ye brother.
Therefore the maid that will do by my counsel shall pass the time with chosen
virgins / like her self: and in good and honest pastimes / and other whiles
with holy redynge or co^munycation / of such things / as she has read: but
let her talk nothy^g of dau^synge / or feastyng / or pleasures / lest her
co^panio^s be moved with some false color of delight: nor let no man be by. And
when she is left of her fellows in her chamber alone / let her not be utterly
idell: for it is ieoperdous to be idel / specially being alone: nor I would she
should suffer her my^de to muse / though hit be never so good and holy at the
beginning: the mind of a woman is unstable / and abides not long in one
place / hit falls from the good unto the bad without any labor. And Syrus
the poet seems not all without a cause to have said / a woman that thinks
alone thinks evil. Nor Mary Magdalene / which sat at the foot of our lord
and herd his word / did not only use the contemplation of heavenly things /
but she did that whether she read / or herd / or prayde. And so shall by mine
advise / not only a maid but also any woman. For in many places of this book
we give precepts for all women in general. Therefore on the holy day let her
either read / or pray / wha^ she is alone: and on the workynge days like wise
/ orels let her work. And hit is no doubt / but the angel found Mary doing
some such thing / which was afcayde / when she saw a man's face / where
she was not wo^te. Therefore she is called i^ Ebrewe alma that is as ye would say
/ a virgin closed in. And this is she yt Esaie the prophet speaks of in these
words: Behold a virgin closed up shall co^ceyue and bear god and man. And
only that maid co^ceyueth Christ / who^ few know / but only Christ. Therefore
shall the maid let no man into ye house at home / but whom her father by
special words commanndeth to be let in: and in process of time she shall
begin to help to ease her mother of her labor in ye house. Whom and her
father to gether / she shall have most dear of all things next god. And if
they co^ma^de their daughter to go in hand with wolle or flax / or any handy
work / she shall not only execute their co^mau^dme^t / without grutchynge /
but also gladly / and with merry chere / and yt the more dilygently and featly /
if the father and mother get any part of their living thereby: and than
shall she think her self happy: and think that she rewards them / that she
should of duete / and to norisshe them again / yt have norished her. When a
maid may for house hold busynes be alone / and pray / first let her give her
self holly to god / let her worship Christ and his mother / and ask perdone
and peace of them / and than consydre her self to be a christen virgin /
Christis spouse / and ye follower of Mary: and that the virginite of ye body is
naught worth / except the mind be pure with all / and if that be / nothing
to be more clean nothing more pleasant to god: and her self to be the follower
of the most holy mother of our lord / and first of all let her countrefete
her excellent virtue / that sobrenes and humilite of mind / which was so
great / that when she had all things most goodlye and excellent / yet was she
never the more high minded / or proud: the most noble maid yt had of her
lignage.xiiij. kings: and so many dukes of Israel co^myn of such a noble kyn
and rich / also her self made rich of the wise men / her self most fair /
most wise / and well learned / and yet for all that / how even a mind did she
bear / how humble opinion she had of her self / also knowing of the heuenlye
birth / being mother of such a son: yet disdayned she not to have a
carpe^ter to her husband / and to do him seruyse / and to go se her kyns woman
/ and to be with her at her laboryng / and serve her: she did set no more by
her self / tha^ by any other: nor disdayned none other / in comparison to her
self / neither for her kyn / nor beauty / nor wit / nor dignite: but she
thought her self worse than any other / when she was in deed better than
a^gels / whose queen she was ordained to be. Wherefore I hold not with hit /
that our lady should be painted so in sylkes and golden garments / and decked
with gemmes and perles / as though she had had any delight in such thing /
when she was in earth here: but nothing less represemeth her / and I had leauer
she should be purtured in a simple array / and such as she used in deed / that
we might have before our eyes yt humilite of her mind more plainly / that it
might be an ensample to teach rich men / and to comfort the pour: and that
the pour men's stomachs may increase / and yt rich decrease / and both
their stomachs be brought to a reasonable mean / that neither the rich men
despeyre / nor the pour be over bold to trust over much. Therefore by my
counsel the maid shall follow her example / not with a faynyng and a
disse^blyng mind / but true and steadfast / lest there be a worse vice lyeng
under a color of virtue / as hit were a poison under an wholesome thing / or a
sore under an holle skin. Let women use no fayny^g / nor cloky^g / to seem
good with all: nor let them not think / that they can cloak / orels change
the nature of things: the countrefete is not like ye very thing / the covered
and shadowed is feeble and unsure / and shall be at last open and known.
Therefore let a yo^ge woman be in deed / as she shows demure / humble / sobre
/ shamfast / chaste / honest / and virtuous / both let her seem so / and be
so: and let her pray unto the holy virgin / whom she shall truly represent with
her living / and be therefore the more pleasant unto her / and also unto Christ
/ yt shall aknowlege her his spouse: let her pray first for her self / yt she
may be increased in virtue / and purpose of her holy chastity / and other
virtues: secondly for her father and mother / brethren / systerne / and kyns
folks / and other / for whom her duty is to pray: for her prayer shall be
most acceptable unto god / and most effectuous to obtain / because hit
comes of a pure and a holy mind / and most christian. I would she should
either understand what she prays / orels speak in that la^gage / that she
does understand: or what so ever she prays in latin / let her get hit
declared unto her in her own tongue before of some body: Nor let her not wene /
ye prayer stands i^ ye murmuryng and waggyng of ye lyppes / but in the heart
and mind / when she lyfteth up her mind from these vile things in earth unto
heavenly and dyuyne things. And where we be commanded in the mass / where it
is said / Sursum corda / that is as much to say / as up our hearts: we
answer / Habemus ad dominum / that is to say / we have unto our lord: In
which answer full many lie / that when they say so / think in deed upon
some worldly busynes. But Christ says / that true worshyppers be these / that
worship the father in spirit: and that this worshyppynge is most pleasant
unto him / and this prayer most acceptable. Therefore let her se / that her
thought and mind dyscorde not from her words: let her speak the same within /
that she speaks without / ye and hold her tongue outwardly and she will / or
talk of other matters / so that she cry unto god inwardly / and say with the
spouse: I sleep / and my heart waketh.

Of the virtues of a woman and examples that she should follow. The.xi. chap.
A woman shall learn the virtues of her kind all together out of books /
which she shall either read her self or else here read. And hit becomes
every woman to be endowed with all kind of virtue / but some be necessary for
her: as all vice is shamfull and some abominable and cursed / and some
virtuous be for wives / some for wydowes / some for religious women: but I will
speak, of such as belong unto the holle kind of women. First let her
understand that chastyte is the principal virtue of a woman / and
cou^trepeyseth with all the rest: if she have that / no man will look for any
other: and if she lack that / no man will regard other. And as the stoicke
philosophers reken / that all goodness stands in wisdom / and all ill in
folly / in so much that they said / only the myse man to be rich / fre / a
king / a cytesyn / fair / bold / and blessed: and a fool pour / a thrall /
an outlawe / a stranger / foul / a cowherde / and wretched: like wise it is to
be judged of chastity in women / that she that is chaste is fair / well
favored / rich / frutfull / noble / and all best things yt can be named: and
contrary / she yt is unchaste is a see and treasure of all ylnes: now
shamfastnes and sobrenes be the inseparable companyons of chastity / in so
much that she cannat be chaste that is not ashamed: for that is as a cover and
a vaylle of her face. For when nature had ordained / that our faces should be
open and bare of clothes / she gave it the vaylle of shamfastnes / where with
hit should be covered / and that for a great commendation / that who so did
look upon hit / should understand some great virtue to be under that cover:
nor no man should se hit covered with that vaylle / but he should love hit: nor
none se hit naked of that / but he should hate hit. Our lord curses an
unchaste woman / saying: Thou haste the face of an harlotte / thou art past
shame. Of shamfastnes comes demurenes and mesurablenes: that whether she
think ought / or say / or do / nothing shall be outrageous / neither in passions
of my^de / nor words / nor deeds / nor presu^ptuous / nor nyce / wanton /
pierte / nor bostyng / nor ambitious: and as for honors she will neither
think her self worthy / nor desire them / but rather flee them: and if they
chance unto her / she will be ashamed of them / as of a thing not deserved /
nor be for nothing high minded / neither for beauty / nor proprenes / nor
kynred / nor riches / being sure yt they shall sone perisshe / and that pride
shall have ever lastyng pain. Now sobrenes keeps continence like as dronkenes
and excess drives hit out. Every man wotteth what follows surfeit. And unto
sobrenes is joined measurable and sklender diet / which things be in
householdyng ye woman's party / as Plato and Aristotle say full well. The man
gets / ye woman saves and keeps. Therefore he has stomach given him to
gether lustily / and she has hit taken from her / yt she may warely keep. And
of this sobrenes of body / comes sobrenes of mind: nor ye fa^tasies of ye
mind shall as they were dronke trouble and disease the quietness of virtue /
but ye she may both think well and do well. Let her apply her self to
virtue / and be content with a little / and take in worth that she has / nor
seek for other / that she has not / nor for other folks / where of ryseth
envy / hate / or curiosite of other folks matters. The devotion of holy
things most agrees for women. Therefore hit is a far worse syghte of a
woman / that aborreth devotion: she must have much strife with envy / which
is both a folisshe vice and shamfull in women / and yet I wotte not how it
assauteth them the most sore: but she that is of good behauoure / and has
inoughe to serve her with / shall have no cause to envy other / nor to be
curious in an other bodis house: and she that is shamfaste / sobre and
reasonable of mind / shall neither be ragious anger / nor fall to raylynge /
cruelty / or bestlynes. For when hit is natural for women to be kind and
gentle / because they be feeble / and need the aid of other / who can be
content with out ragious ire and cruelte in a woman: in so much that she would
spill that she can not save / if need were / and to keep her vengeable mind
unto time and occasion of reue^geance. Such a woman were worthy to have so
much pain / that she should be even oppressed and bruised with noumbre and
weight of hit / and grant her self over commen / and leave her mind of
anger / vengeance / and other madness. For a folishe woman stryueth even with
wild beast is in anger and envy / because their tender and light minds think
every offense paynful and intolerable / and worthy to be grievously punysshed:
and small and light matters seem great and grievous unto folly she folks.
Therefore except a woman either eschew by craft / or over come by power such
fell enemies / hit is icoperdye / lest she be distroyed / and have
everlasting pain / both in this life / and in an other. Now I suppose it be
showed plainly enough / yt chastity is as the queen of veriues in a woman / and
that.ij. inseparable companyons ever follow hit / and that of shamefastnes
comes sobrenes / of which.ij. comes all the other forte of virtues longyng
unto women, demurenes / measure / frugalite / scarsite / diligence in house /
cure of devotion / mekenes / which virtues I shall declare all largely in an
other place: and she shall find them all more habundantly entreated / of holy
and wise men. Behold the image of honesty drawn in picture / which is so
goodly and so excellent of beauty / that if hit could be seen with our
corporalle eyes / as Plato says in the book called pbedo / hit would take
folks wonderously with the love of it self. Nor no beauty does so enamour
our eyes / and takes and holds / as honesty should both take and led with
her / if she were opened and shewedde unto us. Also the maid shall gether by
heryng and redyng holy examples of virgins / which she may follow / whom she
may desire and labor to be like / and specially / as I have said / the most
excellent and flower of virginite our lady / the mother of Christ / god and
man: whose life / not only maids have for an example to form and fashen
themself after / but also wives and wydowes: for she has been all thing unto
all folks to provoke all and bring them unto the example of her chastity:
unto virgins the most demure virgin: unto wives / the most chaste wife: and
unto wydowes / ye most devout wydowe: She was the first that took this strange
way of virginite with a bold stomach and holy purpose: she was the first
that lived above the worldly custom in marriage an angels life / without
carnal use: in so much that she took her a keeper of her chastity / rather
tha^ an husband: which because they were wonders / therefore brought she forth
a son more woderfully / that nature wondered on. And when she was wydowe /
because she lived all in spirit / she lift up her self above the nature of
the body / yet living in the body / having in god a son most obedient /
and most chaste spouse / and most cheryshynge father / that because she
forsook all thing for god / she might find all thing in god. But what do I
holy virgin? What do I enterprise? to speak of thyn infinite preyse? Nay nay
/ that is not for my dull wit / and rudenes of langage / or this little room
/ we had need of great time and leisure there unto / and prompte eloquence /
and wit and counnyng most excellent. But you virgins follow her / as many as
will keep your virginite saffe and holle: Follow her wives / as many as care
for the pleasyng of your husbands / and list perform / that ye have sworn:
you wydowes behold her / in whom you shall have both fruitful consolation of
the loss of your husband / and counsel of keeping your children / and
example of leadyng the residue of your life. There has followed this virgins
order mighty great co^panyes of our thousands / as the psalmyst said: There
shall be virgins brought unto the king after her / whose acts shall profette
not only them that arre now / but also all that shall come hereafter in
example. And histories do tell of pagane virgins / that were famous only by
chastity: Of who^ saint Hieronyme writing against Iouinia^ / grutched not to
rehearse a great nombre out of the histories of the greeks / because he saw
that in this manner of matters folks will be moved much with examples. For hit
seems not veraye hard / to do that some time has be done. And he recites
many / that had leauer lose their lives than their virginite. Nor I will not do
such a displeasure unto that most ancient and holy man / as either to pass
as superfluous that he has told / or to rehearse hit under other manner / but
by and by write here as he has put in his book. So than says he in this wise
/ the thyrty tyrannes in Athens / wha^ they had slain Phedon at a ba^ket /
they comanded his daughters young maids / to be brought unto them / and to be
strypped naked like harlottes / and to play on the flore blody of their
fathers blood / with uncomely and wanton gestures: which for a while
dissembling the countenance of their sorrow / after that they saw the folks
merye with drink / they went forth / as it were to do their natural
necessite / and enbrasyng one another / cast down them self into a well /
that they might save their virginite. In other / daughter unto De motio ye
price of the Ariopagites / wha^ she herd yt her spouse Leostheues was slain /
which had be^ the cause of Lamya^ce war / slew her self / affyrmyng that
though her body was yet untouched of any man / never the less if she were
married unto any after / she should have as hit were a second husband /
because in mind she was married unto the first. The Spartanes / and the
Messenyanes had frendeshyp and confederation to gether long time / in so much
that they used to send either unto other virgins to do certain sacrifyce: So
on a season / When the Spartanes had sent fyfty virgins / and the Messenyanes
would have deuouted them / of all that great noumbre was not one found / that
would co^sente to that abhomynable deed / but al died gladly for their
chastity. Wherefore many a day there was great war between them / and in
long space Marmertia / one of their cytyes was destroyed. Aristoclides the
tyranne of Orchomene loved a maid of the cite of Stymphalis / which when her
father was killed / fled unto the temple of Diane / etc enbraced the image /
nor could not be drawn from thens again / but was slain in ye same place:
For whom all the land of Arcady was so sore moved / that they made open war
to revenge yt maids death. Aristomenes of Messene / a good and a just man /
wha^ he had conquered the Lacedemonia^s / and on a time as they kept a
festyuyte in the night / which they called Hiacinthina / took away.xv.
maidens that were playenge in company there / and went all night a pace fleyng
out of the country with them: and when some of his men would have devoured them
/ he charged them / as well as he could / that they should not do so: and at the
last some that would not obey he put to death / to fear the rest with all.
After / wha^ these maids were redeemed again by their friends / and they saw
this Aristomenes sewed for the death of a man / they would never go home / but
lay prostrate at ye fete of ye iuges until they se hy^ quitte / that was
defender of their chastity. How should we sufficie^ly preyse the daughters of
Scedasus of Leuctres / a town of the country of Beoce / which their father
being from home / as we read / had received.ij young men by the way of
hospytalite / and they drunk with over much wine / in the night rauyshed ye
maids / which wha^ they had lost their virginite / would live no longer / but
kyld one an other: Also the maids of Locrean be worthy to be spoken of / that
had a custom in their countres / to be send yearly unto Ilium: which custom
had continued a thousand year / nor yet was there never herd tell / yt any
had any report and name of disteynynge their virginite. Who can let pass
unspoken of the.vij. maidens of Milesye / which when the french men distroyed
all about their country / killed them self / lest they should be compelled to
any villainy / leauyng an example unto all virgins / that unto an honest mind
the chaste pureness of body ought to be more regarded than the life. Nycanor
after he had conquered Thebes the cite / was taken in the love of a maid /
that he had taken prisoner / and would have married her / which thing might
have pleased a pour prisoner / but she set more by her virginite / than by
his kingdom / and there killed her self / which thing he made great sorrow
fore / holdyng the dead body in his arms. Greek writers tell of an other
maid of Thebes / that when her enemy a Macedon had deflowred her / a while she
dissembled her anger / and after found the corrupter of her virginite slepyng
/ whom she slew / and after that her self / for joy that she had aue^ged her
self of that abhomynable vilanye: nor she would live no longer / than she had
her virginite: nor dye / till she had avenged her chastity. All this says
saint Hieronyme. Therefore christen women may be ashamed / if any shame were in
them / that do not keep their chastity truly: living under the most chaste
Christ / son of the most chaste mother / and in the most chaste church /
and faith / seeing that pagans / worshippers of filthy Iuppiter / and baudy
Venus / have set more by their chastity / tha^ all other things. Where to
should I recyte here the examples of holy virgins / to move them with / that be
not ashamed / that chaste pagans should be ones named? Whom should I specially
show them to follow example of among so many thousands / Tecla / or Hagnes /
Catharine / Lucia / or Cecile / Agatha / Barbara / or Margarita / or Dorothe /
or rather the holle flock of the.xj. thousa^de virgins / which all had
leauer dye / than they enemies should do their coursed pleasure with them?
Thou shalt skarse find.ij. men that shall so steadfastly agree in that holy
purpose: wherein.xj. thousand render virgins were to fast and stable. There
were infynyte in nombre / that had leauer be killed / heded / stra^gled /
drowned / or have their throtis cut / than lose their chastity, which wha^
they would not ste them self / yet they sought craft to come by their death /
wha^ they were in ieoperdye of their chastity / as Brasilla / a noble maid /
borne in Dirchache / a cite of Italy / which wha^ she saws her enemy come to
be rafte her of her virginite / promised unto him / that if he would do her no
vil lany / she would give him an herb / where of if he were anointed with ye
iuse / no wepen should perce him: the man of war was content with the offer:
So she went in to the next garden / and there took up an herb / the first
that came to hand / and bad him aue^ture the first proof on her self / of the
virtue of the herb / and anointed her throat there with / and bad him smite /
to assay: so he smote / and killed her. Neither saint Hieronyme disaloweth /
that a woman kylle her self / to save her chastity with. And saint Ambrose in
the.iij. book / that he writes of virgins / laythe against this doubt the
example of Pelagey the martyr / saying / there needs none other confyrmation /
where we have the deed of a virginne and a martyr / of fyltene years of age /
which with her mother and her syters together / cast her self in to a water.
Saint Euseby in the ecclesiastical history says / that one Sophronia a noble
woman / when she saw her husband that was the chief offycer of the cite
afferde / and unable to defend her goodness against the foul and unlawful
pleasure of Maximine the emperor / closed her self in her chamber / and there
killed her self: and yet the church has allowed her for a martyr. All these
examples of chastity be read in the church. How dare an unchaste and a
noughty woman come thither / nor be a basshed to bring a brothelrye in to the
company of virgins / and defyle those pure etes with her filthy lokes / and
polute tender years with her corrupt voices? Thou ungracious woman / darste
thou name Catharin / Hagnes / or Barbara / and fyle those holy names with thine
vnpure mouth? Darste thou name thy self by any of those names / and make thy
self in name like unto them / to whom thou art so unlike to in conditions /
and a very deedly enemy? Nor comes hit not to thy remembrance / when thou
hereste thy self called / what manner one she was / whose name thou bear?
And wha^ thou remembrest / that she was so pure / chaste / and good / and again
thy self so vnpure / unchaste / and vugrations / doste thou not rage day and
night / for thought and repentance? O thou most shameless of all women / how
dare thou halowe the natiuite of the most pure virgin / that art thy self
unworthy ever to be borne? And dareste thou show we thy shameless face unto her
most demure eyes? And would thou have her to here or look at the so over
couerte with noughtynes / which when she was in this world / was never wont
to se nor here no me / not though they were full good? Hit were better for the
never to come in to their sight / lest they avenge on the the injury of their
kind: nor to name thy self by their names / self they punyshe the for fylyng
their names. And I speak in ernest / for here is no place to bourde in: there
should be made some decre / that none unhonest woman should be called Mary.
For why do not we give as much honor unto that name / whom all we a rise
and make reverence until / as the pagans gave unto some of their folks. For
i^ Athens / wha^ Hermodius and Aristogiton had bany shed the tyrans out of the
cite / there was by a decre determined / that no bond man / nor any that
occupped any vile craft / should be named by their names.

How the maid shall behave her self for the abroad. The.xii. Chaptre.
HOrthe she must needs go some times / but I would hit should be as selde as
may be / for many causes. Principally because as often as a maid goth forth
among people / so often she comes in judgment and extreme perell of her
beauty / honest / demurenes / wit / shamfastnes / and virtue. For nothing
is more tender / than is the same and estimation of women / nor nothing more
in danger of wrong: in so much that hit has be said / and not without a
cause / to hang by a copwebbe / because those things / that I have rehearsed /
be required perfet in a woman: and folks iugementes be dangerous to please /
and suspititous: and as Ovid says / we be quick enough in beleuynge the ill.
And as Cicero says / Nos thing flees more sweftly than an ill word /
nothing gothe sooner forth / nothing is sooner taken / nor brodder spredde: that
if a sklander ones take hold in a maids name by folks opinion / hit is in a
manner everlasting / nor can not be washed away without great tokennes and
shows of chastity and wisdom. If thou talk little in company / folks
think thou canste but little good: if thou speak much / they reken the
light: if thou speak vncou^nyngly / they count the dull wytted: if thou speak
counnyngly / thou shalt be called a shrewe: if thou answer not quickly / thou
shall be called proud / or ill brought up: if thou answer / they shall say
thou wylt be sone ouercome^: if thou sit with demure countenannce / thou art
called a dissembler: if thou make much mouynge / they will call the folishe:
if thou look on any side / than will they say / thy mind is there: if thou
laughe when any man laugheth / though thou do hit not a purpose / straight they
will say thou have a fantasye unto the man and his saying / and that hit were
not great maistry to wy^ne the. Where to should I tell / how much occasion of
vice and noughtynes is a broad? Wherefore the poet seems to have said not
without a cause: It is not lefull for maids to be seen abroad. How much were
hit better to abide at home / than go forth and here so many judgments / and
so diverse upon the / and be in so many leopardies? Nor there is none / that had
more need to follow this greek saying / Live unknown. Therefore Tucydides said
/ she was the best woman / of whom was least talk / either unto her preyse /
or her dispreyse. A woman should be kept close / nor be known of many / for
hit is a token of no great chastity or good name / to be known of many / or be
songen about in the cite in songs / or to be markedde or named by any notable
mark / as white / lame / gogle eied / little / great / fat / maimed / or
stuttynge / these ought not to be known abroad in a good woman. Why than say
some / should we never walk out of our own doors? Should we ever lie at home?
that were as though we should lie in prison. For so does some proud foles take
this saying / that desire to se and to be seen. Nay verily they shall go forth
some times / if need require / and if their father command or their mother:
but before she go forth at door / let her prepare her mind and stomach none
other wise / tha^ if she went to fight. Let her remember / what she shall here
/ what she shall se / and what her self shall say. Let her consider with her
self / that some thy^g shall chance on every side / that shall move her
chastity and her good my^de. Against these darts of the devil fleing on
every side / let her take the buckler of stomach defended with good examples
and precepts / and a fyrme purpose of chastity / and a mind ever bente toward
Christ. And let her know / that she goth but to vanyte / which lest she
be taken with it / she had need to provide wisely / and that that she shall se
forth abroad / is to be counted none other thing / but a show of the life of
the world: by whose vices set before her eyes / she mayelerne / not only to
keep her self out of the contagiousnes / but more over to amend her own
fautes: and that what hour so ever she turns her self from god unto men /
whether she like them or be lyked of them / she forsakethe Christ: and of
Christis spouse suddenly becomes an adulterar. If she se any goodness / let her
love hit for Christ: if she se any evil / let her fle hit for Christ: Let
her take heed never to garnysshe her self so / nor so go / nor do / or speak
so / that she be ye deuylles snare to chatche men in. She should not only do
none ill her self / but as much as she can / so behave her self / that she
be none occasion unto other of doing ill: orels shall she be a membre of the
devil / whose instrument she is all redye / and not Christis. They say / that
the holy virgin our lady was so demure and sad / that if any man cast a
wonton eye upon her / that foul heat was all quenched as though a man had
cast a fire bra^de in to the water. Now when she is appointed with these
thoughts and such other / let her go forth with her mother if she have any /
and have leave to go: if she have no mother / let her go with some sad woman
/ that is a wydowe / or a wife / or some good maid of virtuous living / sobre
of speech / and holy shamfastnes. Homerus writes / that ye chaste woman
Penelope did come forth into the company of her wowers / but not alone / but
with two honest maids in her company: and also her son Telemachus was a
monge them sitting. And as saint Hieronyme commands / when she goth forth
abroad / let her not bear her brestis and her neck bare / but hyde her face /
and with scarsly an eye open to se her way with all: Neither let her desire to
se / nor to be seen / nor cast her eyes vnstably hither and thither: nor be
busye to know / who dwells in this place / or in that / which ought scantly
to know her own neighbors. He would have all hyd / faue the eyes to lead her
ye way. Nor I can not se / what honest or goodness can be in showing of the
neck bare: how be hit that may be suffered / but to bare the breast and the
pappes / and between the shulders on the back / and almost the shulders / how
foul a thing is that / as the common saying is / a blind man may espy / when
those that se it / some aborre the abhomynablenes: and sum wanton men /
seeing the part of the body / not used to be seen / are set on fire there
with. Whereto were gloves ordained / but to hyde the hands / that they should
not appear / except hit were in work? We read / that the maids of the cite
of Milete were in such a rage in old time / that in diverse places they hanged
their selfs / nor any remedy could be found for that case / there was
commanded under great pains / that they should not do hit / they set not by
pains / nor in deed there is no pain sorer tha^ death / and as for yt they
went to on their own my^des. Than were they watched and kept / yet found
they the means to dye for all their keeping: than at last there was a
commandment given / that which so ever killed her self / should be drawn
naked and bare / through the market place of the town in the open day: and
that pain only made them a ferde: for they would not be seen naked: no not
when they were deed. O incredible demurenes / and worthy to be spoken of / they
that feared not death / the extremeste of all sorrow / yet dread they honesty
in the dead body: and so was that rage seized. And more over Nature her self
/ the wise mother of all things / provides for the honesty of women. For a
wondrous case / Pliny in his natural history writes / that men's bodies
cast in to the sea swymme up right / and women's on the bealy: so nature has
care and respect to wome^s honesty / and yet they them self set naught
thereby. In going / let the woman neither walk over fast / nor over slowly.
Now wha^ she is in company of people / let her show great sobrenes / both in
countenance / and all the gesture of her body / which thing let her not do
of any pride / or to make her self the more comely / but of sobre and very
christian mind: nor let her not behold men much: nor think that they behold
her. Now if the men sit a part / and talk to gether beholding her / yet let
not her think / that they talk of her / nor look at her. For some maids and
young women / that have gotten an opinion of beauty and pretynes in their
self / wene that every man looks at them only and speak of them / and if any
man look at them / though it be but by chance / nothing thinking upon them /
yet wene they that they look at their beauty / and than they smyle: and
because they will not seem to laughe at that matter / they cast forth some
tryfyll / that they think should make folks laugh. A man may some rymes
se.xx. syttyng to gether / whom if a man behold them / they will al laugh at
ones / and say / they laugh at some word or deed of some of them self /
which is never a white worth the laughyng: but yt every one thinks her self
so wondrous fair and goodly to se and behold: in which doing they plainly
show their own folly and lyghtnes. But the maid that will do after my
counsel / shall not set by her beauty: nor judge her self fair: nor laugh
at soly she or lewd words: nor shall rejoice to be much looked upon / and to
be a talking stock for yo^ge men / when she has more cause to weep for hit /
that the most excellent goodness / that she has / should be assauted by so
many crafts and enmys / and that her face does inflame young me^nes mine des
unto soul and unlawful lusts / whom she knows not / whether she can
withstand or not. And for as much as we be in hand with laughing / which
is a sign of a very light and dissolute my^de / let her se that she laugh
not immeasurably. For this I need not to bid her / that she shall not laugh
again unto young men / yt laugh toward her / which none will do / but she
that is naught / orels a fool. Let her not suffer to be plurked at or to be
touched wanto^ly: let her change her place / or go away / and need be: let her
give nothing to no man / nor take ought of any man. The wise man says: He yt
takes a benefyt / sells his liberty. And there is in France and Spain a
good saying. A woman yt gives a gift / gives her self: a woman yt takes a
gift / sells her self. Therefore an honest woman shall another give / nor
take. Full of talk I would not have her / no not among maids: For as for
among men to be full of babble / I maruayle that some regard shame so little /
that they do not dispreise hit. That custom was confermed / as I trow / by
the decree of the devil / that women should be preysed for talkyng eloquently
and pro^tly with men: and that by many hours to gether. What I pray you /
should an ignorant maid talk with a young man ignorant of goodness and counnyng
enough in noughtynes? What should fire and towe do to gether? What should they
talk of so long? What? I am sure of Christ and our lady. nay / but rather by
their communycation they shall be incenced / and kendled / and whether they
will or no / shall be compelled to talk of their heat: and such they call
women of court / and I trow well / of such courts as be now adays / that
be even the fathers of outrageous vice / and the setis of Satanas: Which not
only a thristen body shall keps them from / but also pagannes / if they have
any wit or good mind. But ye will parauenture say / They be not all naught.
First / I can not tell that: and though they be chaste of body / yet be they
unchaste of mind: and though they be good of body / yet be they common in
heart. Nor they lack nothing to make them naught / but a good and convenient
occasion / because they be ever in the eyes and company of many folks. But
whereto should I dispute with these folks? What good man will allow this? Or
who will like hit / but such as never knew so much as a shadow of honesty?
Which would if they could bring hit to pass / have all women naught / that
they might the more easylye fulfylle their vnsatyable lusts: Which be them
self drowned up to both the ears in vice / unhappiness / and vnthriftynes /
that they can neither le their own vice / nor other men's. First let them
put of that cursed darkness / where with they be over layden: and than shall we
believe their judgments of virtue. As for a young woman and a young man / to
talk of love in a corner / is not mete / though they were brethren and
systerne. There may be rehearsed many old examples and new both / of vices
that have be done among brethren and systerne / having occasion and time
secret. So Amon son of king David / defloured his own sister Thamar: so
Caunus lay by his sister Byblis. Saint Augustine would never dwell with his
sister in house: He said hit was naught to se a woman / worse to speak with
her / and worst of all to touch her. Pion an holy abbot / had a sister sore
sick / which wha^ he was desired to go speak with her / or she died / he
closed up his eyes / and was led of an other body unto her chamber / and talked
with her / and so departed away. Neither I would not have brethren to play
with their systers / nor kyns men with their nere kyns women / be they never so
good / and chaste / and co^tinent: neither to kiss them / nor groope / nor
pluck at them. What should that serve fore / but to ripe them and prepare ready
for such as be more lewd: that if they desire any unhonest thing / the
women set in heat there with / shall think on such things as should
touch their chastity? Nor in a great court I would they should not crepe in
to corners. What would they say there / that other folks may not hear: if
they purpose to speak of that / that is pure and chaste? Neither I would there
should be many words between young men and maids / though folks be by /
except they be so pure and honest / that no susspecte of ill can come of
them. For some men be so crafty in noughtynes / and can wrappe in dark
sentence their minds in such wise / that they may yet be understood of her
what they mean / by that they speak unto her: and yet shall the double sense
cause / that they may deny that they meant so / and blame her for wrong
taking their words / and understanding them in evil sense / which they
spoke for no harm: and than they set much by their own wit: wha^ they be
cou^nyng in these crafts / though they be deuoyde of al goodness / but able and
cou^nyng enough to do ill: which thing does not prove any great wit but an
exercise in noughtynes: which as Senec says / is worse / and more foul /
than is a dull and slugyshe wit. For wit is not to be rekened in subtiltis
and deceytes / except we will reken deuylles more wise than angels: but one
good angel is more wise tha^ all ye deuylles in hell. At few words / hit is
good to have very little or naught to do with men / and speak very few words
with them / and those full of sobrenes / honesty / and wisdom: nor thou
shall not thereof be rekened the more moope and fool / but the more wise. And
if judgment should be given of thy disposition / I had leauer ill folks
should reken the rude / than good folks badde. Tell me how much redeste thou
in all the history of the gospel / that our lady ever spoke. The angel
comes in unto her: and she fynisshed the matter with few words / and those
wise and sad / and also holy: She gothe for to se Elisabeth / and speaks to ye
preyse of god: She bry^geth forth a son / which is god: She is lauded of ye
angels / worshyppedde of the hyrde men / and holdethe her peace /
gatherynge and keeping in her remembrance all their sayenges. She was honored
of the wise men of the east / that came thither a great way: and what doste
thou read / that ever she spoke? Some other pauenture would have askedde of
their country / of their treasure / of their learning / or of the sterre: but
she / as became a young maid / spoke never a word. She offers her son in
the temple / and when Symeon prophysied of him / an other would have asked some
moo things / or else the reason and manner of those that be told. The old
man turned his saying unto the maid / speaking of her son: Low he is put
for a fall and a rysynge again of many in Israel / and a sing / against whom
there shall be speaking / and a sword shall cut thy heart / unto the end that
the thoughts of many hearts in Israel may be opened. Some other woman would
have asked / when / how / and where hit should have been: but we read not /
that she said any thing. She lost her dereste son at Jerusalem: and when
she had sought him three days / and at the last found him / how many words
said she to him? Son / why haste thou served us so? Lothy father and I sought
the carefully, After that when she was of more age / at a marriage / she said no
more but this: Son they have no wine. And at the cross she was clean dumine:
she asked never a whytte of her son / neither with whom he would leave her /
nor what he would command her to do / when he dyed: For she had not learned to
pratle among folks. All maids / and al women follow you her: for she was but
of few words: but wondrous wise. Theano Metapontina a poet / and a maid
excellent counnynge / rekened / that silence was the nobleste ornament of a
woman. And Sophocles is of the same opinion: for with silence both wisdom
and chastity be swetely poudered. Thou art none attorney of law good daughter
/ nor pleadeste not in court / that thou shalt need to quaple either thyn
own / or thy clyentes matter / except thou speak. Hold thou thy peace as
boldly as other speak in court: and so shalt thou better defend the matter
of thy chastity / which before just judges shall be stronger with silence than
with speech. We read in histories / that a child was ones brought in to the
commen place of the cite at Rome upon a matter of chastity / and with holdyng
down his eyes / on the ground / and still silence / defended his matter
better than he should have done with long orations of orators. But now to
speak of women / saint Susan excused her self of the crime of adulterye with
silence / and not with words. Now let us here saint Ambrose. The holy woman
Susa^ held her peace / and over came her enemies: for she desended not her
self with resonynge of words / nor with speech of any attorney / but the holy
woman her self holdyng her tongue / her chastity spoke for her. Also in the
book of virgins he says on this wise: I had leauer a maid should love to
little talk than to much: For if women be commanded to hold their peace of
holy matters in ye church / and ask their husbands at home / what should
maids do / suppose you / yt while / in whom shamefastnes garnysheth their age
/ and stylnes commends their shamefastnes? Nor she shall not only among men
behave her self so / but also among women / moderate and litel speech shall
beco^me her / and not shrylle / nor presumptuous / or sign of a man's stomach
/ nor joined with oaths: which thing when hit is uncomely in men / hit must
needs be in women abomynable: nor use her voice to be feate and nyce / nor set
her countenance to cruelte and frowning / nor over sad and sorrowful / or
disdaynyshly / nor dyuersely / nor full of plesance / or over cherefull / or
unstable / or wandryng / or dissolute / showing tokens of a mind there unto
according. Some be so shutle minded / that among their companyons they babble
out all at large / both their own matters and other folks / nor have no
regard what they say / but what so ever comes on their tounges end: and
thereof comes a fa^rasye to lie, when they lack troth: and hereof ryseth the
fable by them / that of one rauyn made an hundred / and of one man slain / a
thousand / and of a mean dog / one more tha^ an Elyphant of ynde: in so
much that now no man can find words to reprehende that inordinate and
shamfull thing with all accordyngly. Every body takes the matter with mirth and
sport / who so can tell a thing the most shamfull / some babble because they
think their self they can no good / without they talk / or else that they
be not half frendely without they pratle out all secrets they can unto other
/ though hit be right ieoperdous. Wherefore many wise men took occasion of that
/ to give precepts / that men should never commytte their counsel unto women
/ neither to his sister / his mother / nor his wife / but this is but a vice of
some / and not of the holle kind as has appeared by example of diverse / as
that woman of Pythagoras schole and sect / that byt of her own tongue and
spytte out in the face of the tyrant / that did turment her / lest she should
be compelled of necessite to tell that she would not. I let pass here the
women of Mylete / which kept their husbands counsel at Massyle many a day
/ so long as was necessary. Tacitus writes / that Epicaris because she was
of counsel of the treason that Piso went about / was commanded to be haled
with turme^tes / to cause her for to show. The first day she was attasted with
beatynge and fire / and that the more grievously / because the turme^tours were
angrye / that a woman should set them at so light: yet for all that she was
not ones moved / nor would not confess that she knew any thing. The next
day she was brought unto the same pains again / and was carried up in a
chair / because her bones were so haled in sunder / that she could not stand
/ and there she took a towell / that was tied about her breast / and fastened
hit to the top of the chair in manner of a snare / and put in her neck /
and there hanged by hit with all the weight of her body / and wrong out that
little life that she had. We read in the histories of the Athenienses / that the
concubyne of Aristogiton / which banysshed Pisistrotes children / called Leena
by name / when she was haled upon tourments / to show where her lover was /
she suffered al thing still and patiently. If that harlottes and noughty women
did thus / what should we suppose good women would do? Let not the maid be
over busye in a another bodies house / neither riffle up and search every
corner: nor desire to have or know more than folks will show of their own
good will. Nor let her not skolde and chyde forth abroad / neither for small
matters / nor though hit were for great possessions: hit is better to abide
the loss of her goods / than of her good name / and honesty / and her
shamfastnes / which things she ought to have most in price. As for feastis /
great dyners / and bankettes / I wot not what precepts to give christen
folks concerning them / in ye custom ye now is worse tha^ among pagans: in
so much that he shall be rekened mad / that will not suffer him self to be
taken and drawn with thuse of the world / but will withsta^de such multitude
of people him self alone / or else with very few moo. Therefore let the woman
give an ear unto the pagane Ouide / because she will not regard a christe^ma^s
words: For he in geuy^g those unthrifty rules of loving / speaks of these
common resortynges unto plays and feastis in this manner:

They come to se / and eke for to be seen /
Full much chastity quayled there has been.
Iuuenall the poet / in his book called Satyrs says / that no wives / that
list content and please sad and honest men / will be found or seen at comen
plays / daunsynges / or other great resort of people. Ovid says / that
feastis and bankettes be the instruments and armor of Venus and Cupide. And
to say good sothe / what guard of chastity can there be / where the maid is
desired with so many eyes / where so many faces looks upon her / and again she
upon so many? She must needs fire some / and her self also be fyred again /
and she be not a stone. More over there is laid great nourysshement unto that
heat / by the reason of meat and drink of the feast / and talkyng /
towchynge / gropyng / and pluckyng / and many other wanton points / where unto
that vnbriddled Bacchus gives liberty and boldness. What mind can be pure and
holle among all this gear / and not spotted with any thought of lust. The
folysshe people weneth a young woman does no sin / except she lie with a man
in deed. Than thou that art christened by the gospel of Christ / how doeste
thou here or read the words of Christ in the gospel / where he says: Thou
shalt give a count in the day of judgment for every idell word that thou
spekest? Now than among yo^ge men and young women / in resortynges and
drynkynges / how many words fly to and fro / not only idle / but also
ieoperdous. And also where he says: Who so looks upon an other man's wife /
and desires to have her / he has committed adultery all ready with her in his
heart: suppose you not / that this was meant as well by the woman / beholdynge a
man? And to be brief / thou art not christened / nor spyrituall / but a
pagane and carnal / if thou do not believe that thou have a spring of
ungraciousness with in the: And that hit forces not / what the mind be / but
the body. I dare be bold to say / that few young women / after they begin
to wax toward womans state / come from feastis / and ba^kettes / and resort
of men with safe minds. But some be taken with eloquence / some with
delyueraunce of body / some with one propretie / and some with other: which a
young woman shall find in a great multitude of men / set like nets. And hit
is an hard thing to escape vncaught with those things / where unto she is some
thing inclined all ready. How much were hit better not to love this ieoperdy /
than to perisshe in hit / as the wise man says? Verily my my^de is / and I
trow Christis too / that maids should be kept at home / and not go abroad /
except hit be to here mass / and that well covered / lest they either give
or take occasyon of snarynge. A christen maid ought to have nothing a do
with weddyng feastis / bankettes / and resortynges of men. Finally / what mine
opinion is / concerning young women / you may know by that / ye I would not
have yo^ge boys brought unto feastis / both because hit hurts the strength
and the health of the child / in his time of growing: and because that
feastis be the sprynges of great and many vices / be they never so sobre and
moderate. A child shall se there many uncomely things / and learn much
noughtynes / even among aged me^ / though they be right wife. Where to should I
say among women and men / where after their minds be inflamed both inward
and outwardly unto foul lust / be they never so well kept under / yet will
they show them self foul and outragiously: nor will be brydled in / nor obey
their governor? What than will they do / if they be provoked forwards? than
in deed there will be neither rule nor measure / nor any respect of honesty.

Of daunsynge. The.xiii. Chap.
Now let us speak of that thing / which some maids do nothing more gladly
/ and be taught also with great diligence / of both father and mother / that
is to dance counnyngly. I will make no mention here of the old use of
wrastlyng / which both Plato and many of the stoicke philosophers said was
wholesome for honest men's sons: and Cicero and Quintilian called necessary
for an orator: Which was nothing but a certain informynge of gesture / and
mouynge of the body / to set and move all in comely order / which craft now /
as many other be / is clean out of use. I will entreat of this daunsyng / that
now a days is much used / which many of the Greeks preysed / as they did
many moo things / some solysshe / and some also fylthy: which ye sage people
of Rome refused: nor we read not that ever any of those sad matro^es used
dau^syng / Salust writes / that one Sempronia did both sing and dance more
counnyngly / tha^ was necessary for a good woman. Also Cicero / defendyng Muren
against Cato / which had laid unto his charge / that he had used dau^synge in
Asia / where he was governor for a season / which deed was so disalowable /
that he durst not defend hit for well done / but styffely denied / saying
more over / that never sobre man daunsed / except he were mad: neither being
alone / neither at an honest and measurable banquet. Feastynges out of time /
and pleasant sportis / and delicate pastime bring ever dau^syng in the last
end: So that dau^synge must needs be the extreme of all vicis. But we now in
christian Countries have schools of dau^synge / how be hit yt is no wondre /
seeing also we have houses of baudry / so much the paga^s were better and more
sad than we be: nor they never knew this new fasshion of daunsynge of ours
/ so unreasonable / and fulle of shaking and braggyng / and uncleanly
handlynges / gropynges / and kyssyngis: and a very ke^dlyng of leachery. Whereto
serves all that bassynge / as hit were pydgyns the birds of Venus? In old
time kyssyng was not used / but among kyns folk: now is hit a common thing
in England and France. If they do hit because of Baptism / that they may seem
all as brethren and systerne / I preyse the intent / if other wise / I se not
where unto hit perteyneth to use so much kissing / as though that love and
charity could none other way stand between men and women. Without this were
their purpose / to stere up their bodily lustis in such cold countries.
Verily me thinks hit is a foul and a rude manner. But now to speak of
daunsynge: what good does all that daunsynge of young women / holden up on
men's arms / that they may hoppe the higher? What means that shaking unto
mydnyght / and never weary / which if they were desired to go but to the next
church / they were not able / except they were carried on horse back: or in a
charette? Who would not think them out of their wyttis? I remember / that I
hard upon a time say / that there were certain men brought out of a far
country in to our partis of the world / which when they saw women dance /
they rounne away wonderslye afraid / cryenge out / that they thought the
women were taken with an vnked kind of francy. And to say good soth / who
would not reken women frantycke / when they dance / if he had never seen women
dance before? And it is a world to se how demurely and sadlye some sit /
beholding them that dau^ce / and with what gesture / pase / and mouynge of the
body / and with what sobre footynge / some of them dance. Wherein also a man
may spy a great part of their folly: that go about to handle such a folisshe
thing so sadly: neither se them self have a matter in hand with out any
wisdom / neither any thing worth / but as Cicero says a companion of
vicis. What holy woman did we ever read of / yt was a dau^ser? Or what woman
now adays / yt is sad and wise / will be known to skyll of dau^synge / and
will not refuse it if she be desired to dance? For they know well enough / it
is a folisshe thing / or else they would do hit of their own courage. But they
will not be glad to come where daunsynge is. For what chastity of body and
mind can be there / where they shall se so many me^nes bodies / and have their
minds entysed by the wyndowes of their eyes / and by the means of the most
subtle artificer ye devil. There is also a certain saying of an holy man /
that he had leauer plowe and dygge upon the holy day / than dance. Saint
Ambrose writes unto his sister / saying in this wise: Myrthe ought to be in a
clear conscience and a good mind / and not in spysed bankettes / and wedding
feastis full of mynstrelsye. For there shamfastnes is ill defended / and
unlawful abusion susspected: where the last end of pleasure is daunsyng: from
which I desire all virgins of god to keep them self. For no man (as a
certain wise man of the paga^s says) dau^seth / if he be sobre / except he
be mad. Now than / if that either dronke^nes or madness be rekened to be the
cause of daunsynge / among the pagans / what than should we count to be
commanded in the holy scripture: where we read that Sayncte Johan the Baptiste
/ the messanger of Christ was put to death at the pleasure of a daunsynge
wenche? By the which thing we may take example / that this unlawful pastime
of dau^synge has been cause of more hurt / than ye fransy of robbers and
murderers. This deedly feast was prepared with a kyngly largess and excess
/ and watch laid when company was at the most / and than the daughter /
which was hid up before in secret / brought forth to dance before the
people. What could the daughter learn more of her mother / which was an
harlotte / but to lease her honesty. For nothing inclyneth folk more to
bodily lust / than by uncomely mouyng and gesture / to show the operation of
these parties / which either Nature has hid secretly / or good manner and
nourture has covered: or to play castis with her eyes / or shake ye neck / or
swing her hear. Wherefore they must needs fall in to offense against the
majesty of god. For what honesty can be kept there / where daunsynge is. So
than the king delyted with that pastyme / bad her ask what so ever she would.
This is saint Ambrose saying.

Of loving. The.xiiii. Chaptre.
Love is bredde by reason of company and communycation with men: for among
pleasures / feastis / laughing / daunsyng / and volupties / is the kyngedome
of Venus and Cupide: And with these things folks minds be entysed and snared
/ and specially the women's / on whom pleasure has forest dominion. O miserable
young woman / careful may thou be / if thou depart out of that company
entangled all ready / how much better had it ben for the to have bydden at
home / and rather to have broken a leg of thy body / than a leg of thy
mind? How be it yet I will go about to find a remedy to save the from
taking / if thou be untaken: and if thou be taken / that thou may skape out
again. I will let pass here / that has be said by philosopers / and all
holy and wise men against Cupydes love: nor I will not rehearse the writing of
those / which seem to have preysed love pourposely. But they / whom I spoke of
here before / what araylynge do they make of love / calling him tyran /
myscheuous / cruel / hard / unkind / foul / ungracious / cursed / wicked /
and causer of most unhappiness. Saint Hieronyme says of love i^ this manner /
After thopinion of Aristotel and Plutarche: Love of the beauty is a forgettyng
of reason / and the next thing unto fransy / a foul vice / and an unmannerly
for an holle mind / it troubles all the wyttis / hit breaks and abateth
high and noble stomachs / and draws them down from ye study and thynkyng
of high and excellent things / unto low and vile and causes them to be full
of gronyng / and co^playnyng / to be angry / hasty / foolehardy / strayte in
rulynge / full of vile and servile staterynge / unmeet for every thing / and
at the last unmeet for the love hit self. For when they burn so without
measure in desire to obtain their purpose / they lose the most part of their
time / in suspeciousnes / mournyng / weeping / waylynge / syghynge / and
complaining: where with they make them self hated / and in co^clusyon hate
their own self. Thus says saint Hieronyme. Who can now express with words
/ how much perjury / what disceytes / what murder / what slawghter / what
destruction of cites / of countres / and nations / this love has caused? What
needs me to rehearse here ye distructio^ of Troy made for Helayne: or to tell
what great multitude of people was there slain: or of ye great war between ye
Lacedemo^ia^s and Mecenia^s / for the mayde^s taken away: or the holle empire
of the Lacedemonia^s brought in decay by Epaminu^das the captain of Thebes /
at Leuctras in Boece / which took vengeance upon them (as Plutarche makes
mention) for ye daughters of Scedasus rauysshed by the young men of Lecedemo^?
and because ye rulers of the cite regarded not his complaynt. King Rodeticke
of Spain lost his country / when hit was most flowrishyng / for detylynge
Cana ye daughter of Julian therle / and left hit to be over run and spoiled
of the Agarens. Adam also for the love of Eve / lost and cast away mankind.
Virgil cries out saying: What myschiefe does not gold cause? Nay but what
myschiefe does not love cause? It compelled David the most gentle king to
cast innocent Vri in to manifest ieoperdye / that he might have Barsabe at his
liberty. Solomon the most wise king was so doted with love / that he fell
to idolatrye. Sampson lost his strength thereby. Medea was compelled to all to
cut her brother / and slay her own children: and Catiline to sle his own
son for ye love of Oristill / that he might ryd his house for her. Many young
women have hated both father and mother / and all their kynne because they have
let them of their love. Many have poisoned their own mothers / that they
might run away with their lovers. This inordinate and cruel affection if one
might se it with ye bodyly eyes / he would be as ferde as though a wild beast
were brought suddenly upon him / and would ru^ne away for dread as far as
ever he might. Wherefore it you be not enfected all redye with the venom of this
serpent / call often unto remembrance this little verse: Love may be taken up at
ones pleasure / but not laid away.

Therefore hit is in thy power to love or leave before thou fall in to hit. But
after thou be ones in / than art thou not in thyn own power / but under it /
neither thou canste not rydde the thereof when thou would. Who would be glad
to receive home such a guest? Who will not keep hy^ away from his house: For
love first of all troubles and tosseth al thing up set down at his lust /
that him self may bear the more outrageous rule / and confou^deth and
blyndeth ye wit and reason / that it shall not se and know what is done
within / but suffer it self to be holly led and drawn at loves pleasure.
This cruel venom that so robbethe us of our sight / and draws us over a
thousand rocks and hills / and many times throws us in such a doungian /
from whence we can never escape out. There is no deed so ungracious / so cruel
/ so outrageous / or so strange / that we will not do to obey love. Disceyue
friends / kyl kyns folk / sle father and mother / mourder children / whom her
self has borne / all these be but trifyls for loves pleasure: neither it is
rekened any great grievous act to destroy utterly their country / to perysshe
an holle realm / or rydde up all mankind. What remembrance can here be of
holiness / of virtue / justice / god / of devotion / or good mind / all is but
iapes / yea and finally thyn own health forgotten. Wherefore / who so is safe
enough / and consydereth these things / and does not his diligence never to
come in to this rage and fransy / is worthy to be kept therein / nor never to
find end or measure of that iuell / but to be vexed both day and night with
the fire brande of Cupide: neither to take meat / nor sleep / nor se / nor
rest / neither to have any use belonging unto mankind. This affection of
love takes wonders sore the minds of all folks / and specially of women:
Wherefore they had need to take the more head / lest it steal in upon them.
For it comes commonly at unware upon such as will take no labor to avoid
hit / when they be in the danger and occasions thereof / nor care what mind
come / but receive hit when it comes / as a sweet and a pleasant thing: not
knowing what and how perilous a poison / lies hid under that pleasant
face. Therefore they should specially withsta^de the first occasions: which
thing Ouide the master of love counsayleth / and as the Prophet in the psalm
does teach: Suffer not those children of Babylon to grow up / but knock
them upon a stone / and break them on the hard fyrmame^t of religion / that is
Christ / which in the cantikels gives warning unto virgins / saying: Take
ye the young foxes / which mar your vins. And he commands to take them the
more dilygently / if the vins show all ready flowers of good fruit. Now love
by long space waxes more / and gethereth strength as many other things do /
For Ouide says /

I have seen a wound / that in the beginning
Might easily have be brought to healynge
Which by delay and continuance
Has after grown unto more greuaunce.
Give none ear unto the lover / no more thanne thou woldeste do unto an
inchauntoure or a sorcerer: For he comes pleasa^tly and flaterynge / first
praysynge the maid / showing her how he is taken with the love of her
beauty / and that he must be deed for her love: for these lovers know well
enough / the vain glorious my^des of many / which have a great delight in
their own preyses / where with they be caught like as the Byrder begyleth the
birds. He calls the fair / propre / wytty welspoken / and of gentle
blood: Whereof parauenture thou art nothing at all / and thou like a fool
art glad to here those lies / and weneste that thou doeste seem so in deed /
when thou art never a whytte so: But put case thou doeste seem so / look
whether he call the wise and honest / which if he do not all thy preyse is
naught: and if he do / what may he hope to get of the? For if he hope to
obtain his purpose thereby / than has he belyed the. How has he tha^ handled
his matt? He says he is taken with thy propretes: what than? and says he
shall dye / except he may have the / yea there is the cause of his complaynt.
Therefore beware thou / lest thy self be taken also with his words / and
perysshe as well as he. He says he shall dye for the / yea and that he dies
eue^ straight way. Beleuest thou that? A fool / let him show the / how many
have dyed for love / among so many thousands as have been lovers. Love does
pain some times but it never sleeth. Or though he did dye for the / yet it
were better for the let him perysshe / than be perisshed thy self: and that
one should perisshe tha^ twain. I need not to rehearse here / the common song
of lovers / which they sing only to disceyue / when they have many times not
one drop of love toward her. For if he had ones fulfilled his appetite of
the / than would he show how much he loved the. If he had loved thy good
virtues and mind / as long as thou had lived / he would never have been
full or weary of the. But now because he loved but only thy body / and the
short pleasure thereof / therefore wha^ the body decays / his love also
vanissheth away / and he filled and saciate with pleasure / lotheth ye plente.
There be not a few examples thereof: neither we need not to fetch them of the
old world. For there is none so ignorant / but he has hard tell / and seen
thousands of men / which when they had abused young women for a season / have
cast them up in to some stews / because they never loved them in deed. And
many that have loved very ferue^tly / have been turned at ye last from hot
love unto mortal hate / and have kylde their loves / or cut their throttis.
There is no cite / wherein those things be not hard daily. Wherefore I wonder
much of the folly of young women: Which wyllyngly drown them self in ye
great see of wretchedness. Whereof come so many stews / and so many harlottis /
yea that have been common of honest kynne? What is the cause / that so many
young women lie pockye / and scabbed / in spyttels / and lazer houses / and
that young women? What is the cause that so many go a beggynge / pale and
sick / but these means? Wherefore if no regard of virtue / no regard of
goodness and honesty may move the / if none actis of holy virgins may revoke
the / at least wise let these miserable chancis of young women turn the /
which doutlesse shall light upon the / if thou follow on the same way that
they have gone before. For the lover will disceyue the / either because it is
his custom to disceyue / or because that is the reward of this fylthy love /
orels because the pleasure lothed by the reason of abundance / moves him so to
do. Here unto many things shall profit / that have been told in the place /
where I have entreated of the keeping and saving of chastity: as that good fare
of meat and drink / do not kendle and noryshe love / neither also idelnes /
nor over much keeping of company with men. Lucian the rhetorician enduceth
Venus asking her son Cupide / what is the cause / that wha^ he wou^deth with
his darte of love / both Iuppiter / Neptune / Apollo / Juno / yea and her
self to his own mother / and finally all the goddis / yet does he not ones
meddell with Pallas / Diane / and the Musis? Where unto he answers: Pallas
says he: thretneth me / wha^ I come to ward her / and resists and
withstandeth the occasions. Now the Musis be full of virtuous reverence / and
ever occupied with some virtuous labor: and so they keep them out of love with
their study. And Dian runs about in the woddes and desartes / and so she can
not love / because she flees company. For much of love crepeth in by the
bodylye senses: which after nourysshed with in tender minds and thoughts /
grows unto more. But parauenture the maid is caught all ready / than must we
seek a remedy for the wound / before it co^strayne her to do that thy^g /
which shall cause her ever lasting repentance. First thou may be sorry /
that thou have wyttyngly throwe^ thy self in to that doungian. Nor those
folks ought to be taken head unto / that say / hit lyethe not in their own
power / to eschew love. For so say some / which excuse their own vice with
necessite: as though they had done it agay^st their will. Nor they that so say
seem to know the power and nature of love. Also remember this little verse:
Love can not be thrust out / but it may crepe out. Whereby we may perceive /
that love neither breaks in violently / nor can be cast out violently. But
like wise as hit has by little and little crepte in / so by little and little
it may be put away again. Therefore let not thy mind wandre. For if it be not
kept / it will run thither of hit own accord. Some time consider thy self
/ how many things thou haste done folysshelye / blyndly / and without wit /
brain / or reason / by the means of love: And how much good time thou haste
lost in it / with unprofitable and folysshe cares / and lost the occasions of
many good deeds. Remember also how thou haste bourned / how many things thou
haste thought / said / yea and done / part folisshe / part mad / ye and
some ungracious. Remember in to what misery thou castest thy self like a
blind body: and what a benyfit again thou haste opteyned / that haste
recovered thy sight / and a purpose and will to comme unto better mind
again: Which thing thou may reken to be a great gift of god / and thy
self to be much bound to him for hit. Therefore set thy self unto some work
/ and keep thy self from the syghte and herynge of the parson / that thou
loueddest: and if he come by chance in to thy thought / turn thy mind some
other way / either with redyng or prayeng / or some good communication or some
honest song / or studyeng of some merry matter: so that it be clean and honest.
And if he / whom thou love / have any fault or vice / call that often unto
remembrance / and not what virtue and goodness he has: For there is no body
living but he has some thing / that may be dispreysed: therefore let that be
had first in remembrance and consydre this / that great vices lie often hid
under the color of virtue / and many perilous things cloked under an honest
face outward. Beauty makethe folks proud and disdaynous: noble birth
makes them stately: riches / intolerable: strength of body cruel. Therefore
co^sydre in thy mind / not what he has said / that has lyked the / but what
he has spoken / that has dislykedde the: as if he has either done or said
ought peuysshely / folysshely / foul / horrible / abomynable / lewedely /
vnthriftyly / madly / vngratiously: and by that that comes forth / make
conjecture / what lies hid secretly and closely with in. For there is no
body / but he hydeth his fault as much as he can / and shows his virtue
unto ye vttermoste / and so the virtue appears more than it is / and the vice
less. More over we be disceyued with the nere similitudes of vicis and virtues
/ when every man laboreth to seem better tha^ he is / and we unwisely / and
after the common opinion esteem virtues / calling him liberal that is a waster
/ and him bold / that is foolehardye / and eloquent / that is a great babbler /
and wytty / that is inconstant / where with young women be often disceyued /
when they can not perceive the sothe / and judge the man by that / which
outwardly appears: Neither any man goth to his love / but he sets him self
forth with all his best propretes / that he may seem to lack nothing / that
any man ought to have: and by that means disceyueth folisshe young women /
hydyng great vicis / under a thyn color of virtue / as byrders hyde the lyme
with meat / and fysshers the hoke with ye bayte. This a young woman ought to
consider / before it be to late to repent / lest she begy^ne to wax wise /
when hit shall nothing avail. And if thou be clean gotten out of love / and
healed / and have recovered thy sight again / than shall thou se / how much
thou art bound unto god / that has taken the out of thy madness / and
restored ye unto thy wit. For what virtuous christian woman / or else pagan /
of any wit or honesty / loved ever any other tha^ her husband. Therefore
thou shalt neither desire thy self to be louedde in this wise / neither by
ungracious crafts inflame the minds of men / the which fire shall return
again unto thy self. Many women rejoice to have lovers / whose hartis they
may burn and inflame purposely. O thou ungracious woman / see thou not /
how thou bryngest him in to the possession of the devil with thy craft /
whither thy self shall go also / thereto receive thy mede / where ye shall both
burn / he for being over come of the devil / and thou for over coming him
for the devil / ye shall both be paid your wages? Now the apostle says:
The wagis of sin is death.

How a maiden ought to love. The.xv. Chaptre.
ANd yet I would not a maid should clearly be without love / for mankind seems
to be made and shapen unto love / to thente^t / they may be coupled to gether /
in charity / and not with this carnal and fylthy erthly Cupide and Venus / but
the heavenly and spiritual / which causes holy love. Wherefore the maid shall
have to love the father almighty god / her spouse Christ / and his mother the
holy virgin / and the church of god / with all the holy virgins / whose
soulis dwell blessedly in heaven: and their names be had in honor / here in
earth. She has also her own father and mother / which brought her in to the
world / and brought her up / and nourisshed with so great labor and care:
whom she ought to have in the stead of god / and love and worship / and help
with all her power. Therefore let her regard greatly their co^mandementes / and
mekely obey them / neither show in mind countinance nor testure any
stubbernes / but reken them to be as it were a very image of almyghtye god /
the father of all thing. She has also to love / her own virtues and soul /
and mind given unto god: and more over the eternal pleasure and welthe /
which never shall have end. Which things if she love truly / she shall
neither love man above god / neither set more by a baudye fellow / than her
spouse Christ: nor regard more an old filthy baude / than the pure virgin
Mary: neither love better the stynkynge stews tha^ ye holy church of god: nor
the company of unclean women / above the company of holy virgins: nor strangers
above father and mother: nor her body above her soul: neither set more by
other folks vices / tha^ their virtues: nor minds that seruethe devil / above
those that serve god: neither them that would have her distroyed / above them
that would have her saved: nor a short pleasure / above joy everlasting: nor
the myserye of damned folks / above the perfyte welthe of them that be saved.
By these means the commandementis of god shall be more esteemed with her / than
the counsayles of a disceytfull man: and rather give credence unto Christ /
than unto the words of a lecherous knave: and rather follow the virgin Mary /
than bodily pleasure: and have him more dear / whom she has co^ciled unto the
/ than whom a haudy drabbe counsayleth the unto. Neither break the laws of the
church / to keep the laws of the brothell house: and rather chose ye company
of saint Catherin / Saint Hagnes / saint Clare / saint Tecla / and saint Agatha
/ than the company of them / of whom both ye life is unknown unto god / and
the names unto man / and both well enough known unto the devil. Neither
forsake thy father and mother / to follow thy lover: nor give them perpetual
sorrow / to give thy lover the short pleasure of thy self. Neither wysshe
rather to fare well in thy body / than in thy soul: neither thy body to be in
joy / and thy soul in woe: neither give an ear rather unto an unthrifty tale
/ than a virtuous: nor believe the minister of the devil / rather tha^ ye
minister of Christ. For the pleasure is but short / and the pain everlasting.

How the maid shall seek an husband. The.xvj. Chapter.
THe wise poet virgil / where he does bring in king Latinus / and his wife
Amata / talkyng to gether with Turnus / which should be their daughters
husband / their daughter also present / he makes the maid to do no more but
weep and blusshe / without speaking of words: whereby he signifies / that it
becomes not a maid to talk / where her father and mother be in co^municatio^
/ about her marriage: but to leave all that care and charge holly unto them:
which love her as well as her self does. And let her think that her
father and mother / will provide no less diligently for her / tha^ she would
for her self: but much better / by the reason they have more experience and
wisdom. More over / it is not comely for a maid to desire marriage / and
much less to show her self / to long therefore. It was a custom in old
time among the Romans / while that chaste world lasted / which was the
example of honesty / that when a maid was first married / and brought in to
her husbands house / she should not go in at his door her self / but be taken
up and be carried in by other: as a token / that she came not thither with her
good will / where she should lose her virginite. Therefore when the father and
the mother be busy about their daughters marriage / let her help the matter
forward with good prayer: and desire of Christ and his mother with pure
affection / that she may have such an husband / which shall not let nor
hinder her from virtuous living / but rather provoke / exorte / and help her
unto hit. And the fathers on their parties / let them call to remembrance /
the saying of Themistocles the noble man of Greece / which when he was asked of
one whether he had leauer marie his daughter to a rich ill man / or to a pour
good man / made answer again: I had leauer have a man without money / than
money without a man. Also let him remember the doing of Pittachus / the wise man
of Mytilena / which wha^ a young man / that had chose of.ij. wives / the one
of great substance and kynne / the other egall unto his self of riches and
birth / asked him counsel / whether were better to marye: the wise man had
him go to children playenge. Now had the children a play / wherein they were
wont to sing and repete often these words: Take to the thy pere: whereby they
me^t / that most wisdom was for every man to do so. It is a great charge for
a man to seek an husband for his daughter / neither it ought not to be gone
about negligently. It is a knotte that can not be lightly losed / only death
vndoth it. Wherefore the fathers and mothers / procure unto their daughters /
either perpetual felycite / if they marye them to good men / or perpetual
misery / maryeng them unto ill. Here is much to be studied / and great
delyberation to be taken / with good auisement and counsel / before a man
determyne ought. For there is much werynes in marriage / and many pains must
be suffered. There is nothing but one / that shall cause marriage to be easy
unto a woman: that is / if she chance on a good and a wise husband. O
folysshe friends / and maids also / that set more by them / that be fair / or
rich / or of noble birth / than them that be good: and cast your self in to
perpetual care. For if thou be married to a fair one / he will be proud of
his person: And if thou marye to a rythe one / his substance makes him
stately: And if thou be married to one of great birth / his kynred exalts his
stomach. Now / if thou marye unto one for his fayrenes / which has neither
reason / nor virtue / nor any drop of wit / as it is often proved by
experience / as the wise man of Greece said by these goodly Innes / where be
foul hostesses: by like reason thou might marye an image or a painted table.
Can thou find in thy heart to be a foles wife / for his goods? Thanne
might thou as well desire to be married to an image of gold. Would thou be
married unto a getylman borne / which is of filthy and naught ye living / for
his blood? as well than thou myghteste those the image of Scipio or Caesar. And
in very deed it were better to be married unto an image / or a picture / or to a
painted table / than to be married to a vicious / or a folysshe / or a brayneles
man. Wherefore I may better compare them unto asses / or swyne / lions / or
wolfes / than to mad me^. And in time passed / I thought it had been but a
fable / that men tell / how Palyphat the queen of Candy / did lie with a
bulle: and other as ungracious deeds as that: which I have hard say / other
women have done: but now me thinks them all lykely enough to be true / when
I se women can find in their hearts / to tomble and lie with vicious and
fylthy me^ / and dronkerdes / and braulers / and dawysshe / and brayneles /
cruel and murderars. For what difference is between them and asses / swyne /
bores / bulls / or bears? What madness is it to have delight in such men / and
to flee and eschew wise men / as Plutarke the philosopher says / and flee
honest men and good men / as warely as they would flee from venomous bestis?
Wherefore it was well and aptly spoken / that a country man of mine said /
that the nature of women was in choosing me^ / like unto the female wolves:
which among a great sort of males / take the fouleste and worste favored:
but men never cast any favor to a woman / but for some good propretie /
either of substance / person / or wit. And women many times love some men /
because there is nothing in them worthy to be beloved* whereby they declare
the more plainly / that they go without reason. which thing I say by some
that have nothing a do with their reason / but all given and applied unto
their body: Against whom I have spoken sharply / because they dote / and
fond good young men / and bring them to fylthynes and folly / when they would
feign please the women / and se they can not / except they go wide from all
conditions perteynynge unto men. For like as children / which be given all
unto sport and play / neither have discretion for lack of age to comprehend
any deep matter / have only in price and regard those / that can handle their
sportes and pastymes ye most aptly. so women set all upon pleasures / and
volupties / wantonness / and folly / think no man wise / but those that can well
convey such matters: and what so ever perteyneth to wit and sadness / they
count folly: So their discretion is blinded so sore / that they love / estyme
and set by foles / and count them for great wise men: and abhor them / that
be wise in deed / hate dispyse / and loathe them / and take them for foles: in
like manner as folks that be sick of a great agewe / wene that sweet meat is
bitter: and as sowes have more delice in mire and durte, than in sweet flowers.
What hope shall we have of them / that have so feeble discretion and so
corrupted: For maids that desire and wysshe for such husbands / in whom be
the external gifts of fortune / which the people call good / nor have no
respect unto thyn ward goodness / they be worthy to feel perpetual sorrow /
and to be punysshed for their error / so long as they live: because they
despise that / yt is ye more noble and excellent in deed / in comparison of
that / which is more vile and less worth. O folysshe maid / which had
leauer have co^tynuall sorrow in gold and sylke / than have pleasure in woollen
cloth: which had leauer be hated and beaten in raiment of purple and rich
color / tha^ beloved and set by in a course garment of mean color. If thou
had leauer have that other / take that thou haste chosen / nor be not
discontent with that / which thou have wyrtyngly taken with thyn own hands.
More over / we have hard tell of some so folisshe husbands / that they have
killed their wives / as Iustina a maid of Rome / borne of noble blood / whom
her father and mother married unto a young man of great possessions / but of
small discretion and wit: which wha^ he saw his wives white neck / as she
was stowpyng to unloose her shone / fell straight in to a suspection and ielosye
over her / because of her beauty: and with a sword cut her neck in sunder:
of whom was made this epitaphie following:

My cruel husband to death has de done
And with a sword my neck in sunde cut
As I was stowpynge to untie my shoone
And to pulle out my praty foot
And that beside the bed / where I was laid
With him not long before. O hard and cruel my^de
In that same place / where as he had had
My maiden heed / to show him so unkind
Yet I never offended / wherefore I ought to dye
All mighty god to record I take:
And loo now here-slayne I lie.
Thus pleased fortune mine end to make
But fathers all example take by me
Iustina / as warely as you can
If ye love your daughter tenderly
That you ne marye her to a folisshe man.
Fathers and mothers which marye their children unto good and virtuous mates /
do not only provide well for them / but also for them self. For they get them
such sons and daughters in law / that shall be socoure and aid unto them
in their old age: And if they be noughtys and ungracious / they provide them
of enemies. Now of the son in law / we have an example in the gospel: For
saint Peter's mother in law / wha^ she lay sick of great ague / was made holle
of our lord / at thin-stance of her son in law: Such it was to have so good
a son in law / that Christ disdayned not to take unto his disciple. And of
ye daughter in law / we read an example in ye book of Ruth: That wha^ Noemy
came home into Jury / her own country / out of the land of Moab / her
husband and her sons bey^g deed / and brought with her.ii. sons wives / of
whom ye one called Orpha by name / returned / again to her own country and
friends / but Ruth kept still with her mother in law / and both comforted her
with words / and nourisshed and kept her with her labor: in so much yt
Noemy found in Ruth / both the love of a daughter / and dyligent seruyse of a
son. Noemy had been a wydowe and deserte in deed / if she had had no better
a daughter in law / than Orpha was: but in as much as she had Ruth / she was
not all destitute of children / neither had no cause to name her self Mara /
that is to say bitter / as her mind was to be named. Also after that Ruth had
borne the prophet Esai by her second husband called Booz / women did make as
great semblaunce of gladness unto Noemye / as though she had had of her own
daughter or her own son / not only one neuew / but as though she had had
seven sons her self: For they said to her in this manner: There is one borne
now of thy daughter in law / which shall love the and be better unto the /
tha^ though thou had seven sons. Now before I make an end of this book /
I will answer unto a mad and a fra^ticke opinion / which both maidens and
wives have / and all the common people in general / that think it is
expedyent for maids / that are come to lawful age of marriage / to be seen
often abroad among people / goodly and pykedly arrayed / and to keep company and
communication with men / to be eloquent in speech / and counnynge in daunsyng
and syngyng / yea and to love him before hand / whom they entende to mary: for
so they say / they shall ye more lightly mete with a bargayne. A man might make
a^swere to all this at ones / but I will examyne it from point to point / to
content not only the minds of wise men / but also of them that be rude and
ignorant. What wise man / I pray you / would ever counsel this thing /
knowing / that ill is not to be done / that good may come thereof? and specially
where the ill is evident enough / and the good neither certain nor customed to
follow commenly upon the deed. Wherefore if the maid can get no marriage /
except she infecte her mind / and leoperde her honesty on this facion / hit
were better never to mary: orels to mary only Christ / than to mary first
unto the devil / that she may be married to a man afterward. Now.ii. things
there be / the most precious that a woman can bring with her to a man
honesty of body / and good fame: nor there is no man so folysshe and mad /
neither so set upon beauty and couetyse of goods / neither so ungracious and
so unthrifty of living / but he will be content with any wife / having these
two: which if she lack / how can he be content: Than would I wit / whether
maid is ye more lykely to be of good fame and behauour / whether she that
bydeth most at home / or she that walks much abroad? At home there is none
occasyon of evil / and forth abroad every place is fulle. And of her that
taryeth at home / no man makes question or argument: But of her that walks
much about / every man will say his opinion: where among so diverse sentenses a
maid shall soon catch a blotte: which will stick in no place more sooner
than on a maid / neither worse to get out. Or which of them two do men set
more by? and whether will they thy^ke of most honest demeaner / her that they se
either never / or but seelde / or her / whom they mete in every corner? Verily
I think they will not believe / that she keeps her honesty very well / yt
walks so often forth. And as for prouydynge of her marriage / I think hit
should be more profitable for her / to be hard tell of / than seen. For a
maid that is often in sight / shall chance either to say or do / that may
displease him yt should have her: or some of them that be of his counsel: or
that he gives credence and trust unto. Whereby many times maryages be broken /
even in the point of making. And where as they speak of clothing / wherewith to
make her gaye / if she be married but for that / she must needs be hated / when
^he is without them. For she must needs some times lay away that wede / and be
with her husband at home in mean array. For commonly / as we greatly like
them / in whom we find any special goodness / that we looked not for / likewise
we hate them as sore / that disapoynt our hope of any good bounty. For if thou
seem pyked and propre unto thy spouse / and art not so in deed / after that he
has taken some great hope of thy beauty / he must needs hate the / wha^ he
sees him self dispoyted. More over I could name both in this country and in
my^ own / diverse maids / which could never get marriage / because that men
were abashed of their costely apparel. What say they? this woman would spend
up all her marriage good in one gown / or one broche. Thereto by over richely
aparelled / maids be rekened light. And as for those that keep much company
with men / what man is there / yt will not suspecte ill by them? Or what
husband shall she find so patient / that will be content to have his wife to
company still and common with men? or would not rather have such one / as
would more gladlye company with her husband alone / than with a great
multitude of me^? Where one shall te^pte her mind with eloquence / an other
with comlynes of person / some with beauty / some with lyberalyte / and some
with noblenes. For as for maids to be eloquent of speech / yt is to say great
bablers / is a token of a light mind and shrewde conditions: In so much that
he that shall marye her / shall think he has a serpent and no wife. For yo^ge
men will praise her unto her face / that is fa^^ of talk / and a ioyly dauncer
/ and full of merry conceptes / and play / and pleasant / and call her well
manered / and well brought up / al to have her at their pleasure / but none to
mary her: and all believe that they may quickly opteyne their purpose of such
one: but never a one wylbe glad to have such one to his wife / that he sees
is so applyenge unto every man's will: they preyse for the time all that she
does / because they have delight therein. But and the folysshe maids could here
what men speak afterward among them self one unto an other / without
dissimulation: than should they know in deed how heartily they preysed them
and lyked them: they should understand than / that when the men called her
merry conceyted / they meant they were bablars / and chatters: and when they
called them lusty tyrers / they me^t they were light minded: and where they
called them well nurtred / they meant they were wanton. But some would say here /
yet by these means they come by marriage. I grant / in deed some do: but the
most part does not. For both mo be married / and that also unto better
husbands / that never go about to tempte no men / the which when they se them
self begyled with the women / they kylle them up with ill intreatynge. And
this ye maid may be sure of / that she shall never have good life with that
husband / which she has gootten by wyles and crafts. Or if there be any man
so mad or folisshe / that had leauer have such a woman to his wife / than one
that loves solitariousnes / and is sad both of behauour and aparell / and
mylde of there: such a man would not I marye my daughter to: for he must
needs love lewdnes and vice / that sets more by such knackes / tha^ by
virtue and goodness. Now will I speak a few words of love / the which doteth
all maids for the most part / and disceiueth them greatly / and brings to
much mischief. For hit does not become amayd to make any sign / that she
would feign be married / or that she love any yo^ge man to wedde. For if she love
him before or she have him / that it be known / what shall he think / but that
she will as lightly love another as she has done him / whom as yet she ought
to show no love unto: neither he will believe that she loves him alone / seeing
there is as great cause to love other. And if he should marie her / he will
thy^ke she will have as good my^de to other as him self / when she is so light
of love. Let every body excuse ye matter as they will / but in very deed every
woman / that love the any man vesyde her husband / is accursed / if she have a
do with him: and though she have not / yet is she an harlotte in my^de. And
there has been many that have loved so outragiously / that they have been
obedient unto the pleasure of those me^ / whom they hoped should be their
husbands: And afterward yt men have despised and cast them up: which in my
mind was well and wisely done. For they be unworthy for to be married / that
dare show an example unto those men / whom they should have / how well they
can find in their heart to lie with a man / that is not their husband. For by
likelihode they will both do that same with other men before their marriage / and
in their marriage with their adulterers. There is no day / whereon these things
by chance not in every cite: nor there is no woman so ignorant what is done in
the cite / but she hereth tell of these things. I have hard tell in this
country / that wowars have been forsaken for none other cause / but because
there was no love between the parties before. For the young women said / they
could not love them / nor find in their heart to have them in marriage / whom
they loved not / nor knew before: and this is a great use they say / in
Candye. What need is it to rebuke such minds with words / which who so
does not perceive to be unchaste / I hold her far more noughtye than they
be. Now than love not thou thy husband / because he is coupled unto the by
goddis laws and goddis commandment / but because thou art used to his love
before? So do drabbes and harlottis / which for like cause love their lovers:
and thou art not far unlike unto those drabbes. And so hit chances unto
such women / even by the punysheme^t of god / that all the love / which they
ought to keep in their marriage / they spend it out before. Where of this common
saying came up: that they that marie for love / shall lead their life in
sorrow. For it chances by many / that after the heat of love is ones past /
there follows great hate / which thing often times makes wo^dre and talk
among the people / when they here tell / how so great lovers within.iii.
or.iiij. days fall at debate / and begin to deuorce / or the bryde cake be
eaten. Nor it is no maruayle: for neither the fire may last / that lacks
wodde: neither love / that is not nourisshed with honest loving. For among
ill folks / as Cicero says / can be no sure frendshippe. Wherefore hit is not
expedient to make maryages by love before hand / neither to couple and bind
that most holy charity with so fylthy and brytell bands: and yet much worse
is it to make them to marye by stryuyng / and hate / thretnyng / and suit: as
when they go to law to gether / the man for the woman / bearing her in hand
/ that she is his wife: and the woman in like manner for the man. I never hard
tell of more folysshenes / than for a woman to labor to have a man / agay^st
his will / with whom she shall both live atwynne: and except he love her /
she shall live in perpetual sorrow. And love must be gotten with fair means
/ and not compelled: For he will never be a sure friend / that is drawn and
holden by force. What a madness is hit to begin that sacrament of holy love
with hate? I would not / so god me help / have a servant against his will:
much less a mate: neither hit is not good to compel a man against his will:
Nor I would the woman should be married unto him / except he desire her with
all his heart: nor hit becomes not the maids fre^des to pray or labor for a
marriage / or ones to offer the maid of their party: but ye man should seek
for marriage: and so it should be done in deed / saving that money rules and
ordreth all thing. For now they be married unto money / and money marieth. And
as Senec says / men draw their wives to them with their fyngers. And
therefore se we so many sorye and unlucky maryages / when both the parties se
them self coupled unto the money / and not unto the man or the woman. Therefore
both of them enbraseth and holds fast it. And as for the wife / the
husband keeps her but as his concubyne / and she him as aduoutrer: neither
loves one another / but for the fylthy pleasure of lechery: and else either
hates and enuieth other. But they that would keep the nature of things holle
and pure / neither corrupt them with wrong understanding / should reken /
that wedlock is a band and couplyng of love / benyuolence / frendshippe / and
charity / co^prehendynge with in hit all names of goodness / swetnes / and
amyte. Therefore let the maid neither catch / and disceyue by subtylte him /
that should be her inseparable fellow / nor pull and draw by plain violence:
but take and be taken by honest / simple / plain / and good manner / that
neither of them complain with both their harms: or say / they were disceyued
or compelled.

Here ends the first book of the instruction of a Christen woman.
The second book of the instruction of a Christen Woman.
Of Wedlock. The first Chaptre.
THis is no place here to reason either the lauds or dispreyses of wedlock.
Nor the old questions are to be touched: as / Is it for a wise man to wedde a
wife? Nor the questions of our christen men / concerning wedlock / single
life / and virginite / and other / that saint Augustine / and other doctors of
our christen faith have disputed. I know / there have been some that have sore
rebuked wedlock: and that not only heretics / as the Manicheis / that
utterly commanded to absteyne from marriage: whose errors be clean damned and
banished: but also pagans / which have given judgment of the holle kind of
women / upon certain evil: over much following the common gyse / which upon
the knowledge of a few / deem the holle nation. So the Carthaginences were
defamed as false of promise: So the Cilicians as theuis and robbers: the
Romans as covetous / the Greeks as inconstant and variable. The honest wives
ought to hate and blame the noughty wives: as a shame and sklander unto all the
kind. And truly no man durst ever so far dispreise woman kind: but he must
needs confess / that a good woman is the best treasure / and most luckye
and prosperous thing that can be. And as Xenophon says / she is the
greattest cause of man's felicite. There is nothing more sweet than a good
wife / says the wise man Theognis: likewise Xystus in his sentenses callethe
her man's joy. Eurypides the poet / which was sharply vexed with.ij.
noughty wives / stuffed his tragidies with rebukes and raylynge on women / and
he was named in a greek word / the hater of women: yet never the less he
douted not to affirm / that no pleasure was like theyrs / that had good wives.
And Hesyodus the poet / a very enemy of women / says: that as nothing is more
unfortunate than a man / that chau^ceth on an evil wife: so like wise no
greatter felicite and welthe any man may have / than has he / that has a
good wife. King Solomon / whithe was bysyde him self for women / and of the
most wise made the most unwise / often times as cursynge his wyckedde deeds /
he fyersly rebukes women. But so yet that he shows plainly by whom he mente.
For in his proverbs he writes / that an unwise woman and full of boldenes
shall lack breadde. And as a tree is consumed of the timber worm / so he
says is a man of an evil wife. But look in the same book / how goodlye and
gaye is the preyse of a good woman: of whom he says thus: Noble is her
husband in the gates: when he sytteth with the ancient fathers of the earth.
Fortitude and beauty shall be the raiment of an holy woman / and she shall laugh
in ye last day: She has opened her mouth unto wisdom / and the law of
mekenes is in her tongue / her children have risen up and called her the most
blessed: and her husband has commended her. Many women have gethered riches:
but thou haste passed them all. These and many other good words has the wise
king spoken: which are approved and allowed of every wise man with one assent.
Now I force not for those disputations or more like sermons that sharp wytted
men have made of wedlock. For doutles allerned men bid wed: which thing they
did them self. The.vij. wise men of Greece were married first / and after that
Pythagoras / Socrates / Aristotel / and Theophrast / both the Catons / Cicero
/ and Senec: because they well perceived that nothing was more after nature /
than the couplyng of man and woman: Whereby man kind being in sundry persons
mortal / is made in all to gether ever lasting: and whereby a man yeldeth
again unto his successors / that which he takes of his predecessors: and
as hit were renders a benifite unto nature. Aristotel in his moral books
exorteth wise men unto marriage / not only to thentent to have children / but
also because of company. For that is the principal and greattest unite that can
be. For thus goth ye matter in deed: Of that consyderation and vniuarsall
friendship / where with all folks are knytte to gether as brethren descended of
god one father of all things: where with nature her self / that in all men is
the same / byndeth us to gether with a certain charity / more nere is that
friendship / which is among folks of one faith: and it is plucked more narowe
by man's ordinance and law ciuyle. For citizens favor more one an other /
than they do foreyns: and of cytyzens our special friends are most dear to us:
of them we love best our own kyns folk: and of kyns folk nothing is more
nere than the wife: whom the first father of mankind / as soon as he saw her
/ said by and by / that it was a bone of his bones / and flesh of his
flesh. And when there was yet neither fathers nor mothers / he gave a law /
as in the name of nature / saying in this wise: For her sake a man shall leave
both father and mother / and abide with his wife. Who than can deny but that
wedlock is a thing most holy? Which god ordained in paradise / wha^ mankind
was yet pure and clean / with no spotte defiled. He chose hit in his mother: he
allowed hit with his presence: and would do his first miracle at the solemnyte
of marriage / and there show an euydent token of his godheed / unto the intent
he might declare / that he was comen to save them / that were both lost by
folks so coupled / and borne by folks so coupled. But I write not here of the
preyses of wedlock / where upon often times most eloquente men have made long
sermons. For I do only instruct virtuous women.

What a Woman ought to have in mind when she maryeth. The.ij. Chaptre.
wHat time a woman maryeth / she should call to remembrance the beginning of
wedlock / and busily consider in her mind and thought the laws of it / and
so she ought to prepare her self / that so great a sacrament first
understand / she may afterward fulfill hit. After that god the prince and
maker of this excellent work / had brought man in to this world / he thought
it vnco^uement to leave him all alone / and so joined to him a living creature
/ most like unto him of mind and shappe: with whose conversation and
compenable words / he might swetely spe^de his time: and also because of
generation / if hit pleased him. And in deed wedlock was not ordained so much
for generation / as for certain company of life / and co^tynuall fellowship.
Neither the name of husbandets a name of bodily pleasure / but of unite and
affinite. God led the woman to the man: which means none other thing / but
that god him self was chief author and maker of wedlock. Therefore Christ in
the gospel calls them coupled of god. As Soon as the man lokedde upon the
femalle of his kind / he began to love her above all things / and said /
Now is this a bone of my bones / and flesh of my flesh. And for her a man
shall forsake both father and mother / and abide with his wife: and they
shall be.ij. in one flesh. Where hit is said in one flesh / it is to be
understood one flesh and flesh / aff ye propretie of the Hebrewe speech
signifies mankind both man and woman. So that they which first were.ij. man
and woman conjoined in wedlock / be made one. This is the marvelous mesterye
of wedlock / so to myngle and to couple the man and the woman / that.ij.
shall be made one. The which thing also it has done in Christ and ye church /
as teaches Paul the apostle / which no power save only gods power might
bring about. Of necessite that thing must be most holy / at which god is so
specially present. Therefore what time a woman comes here unto / she ne should
suppose / that she comes to dance / play / and lest / but must ponder higher
things in her mind. God is the over sear / the church is the medyatryce in
marriage. For which cause that thing that is joined and fastened to gether by
so high auctorite / Christ suffers not either to be broken or losed of any
mortal creature / saying in his gospel: That god has joined to gether / man
may not de uyde. Now if it be not lefull to lose it / and that knot is not to
be vnknytte with man's hands / which god has knytte: Like wise no man ought
to open that thing / which is shut with the key of David: which allonely
that immaculate lamb has in keeping. Now than streyghte in the beginning /
thou that art an honest woman / appoint thy self / that thou may in such
wise by^de him unto the with love / whom god by the sacrament has joined unto
the: that the band may be easy and light. Nor never desire that knot to be
vnknytte: nor cast not thy self and him both that is knytte with the / in to
grefe without end / and perpetual mysery. For a great perte of this matter
rests in thy hand: other with pure chastity / mekenes / buxum vsy^g of thy
self / to have thy husband plesa^t and louy^g unto ye / and to lead thy life
welthfully: orels with thy vices of my^de and body / to have him froward / and
crabbed and to ordeyne for thy self grievous turment / which by death shall not
be ended. Thou shall toil / thou shall weep / you shall be troubled / you shall
curse the day yt ever thou were joined unto him / you shalt curse him yt the
begat and her yt ye bare / and al thy kyn / ye and al them ye any thing dye in
thy marriage / if you through thy^ own vices cause thy husband to hate the. But
on ye other pertie / if you by virtuous living / and buxumnes / give him cause
to love ye / thou shalt be mastres in a merye house / you shalt rejoice / you
shalt be glad / thou shalt bless ye day ye you were marted unto him / and all
them yt were helpy^g there unto. The wise se^te^ce says: A good woman by lowely
obeysaunce rules her husband. Plinius ye yo^ger / wha^ he had a wife as his
my^de desired / he was mylde and gentle unto her agay^e / and thanked Hispula
his wives aunte / both for his own and his wives sake / say^g: I thank you ye
provided me of her: and she tha^keth you because you got her me / and as it
were have chose^ ye one unto ye other. Above all this / yt first and as I
suppose only chapter of ye laws of wedlock / yt they shall be.ij. i^ one
person / is ye very ground of wedlock / and ye bo^de of yt most holy
fellowship. Wherefore if a woman direct all her thoughts / her words / and her
deeds unto this poy^t / yt is to keep truly and safely ye pureness of wedlock
/ she ca^ not but live well and virtuously. Therefore an honest and a chaste
woman ought ever to have this in my^de. Therefore she shall study both day and
night how she may fulfill this law / and to express and show it in deed:
trusty^g verily here upon / yt what so ever she be yt fulfylleth this law / yt
is to say / yt rekeneth her self and her husband all one person / and so
lives / yt she may both be i^ deed / and apere to be all one with her husband /
she ca^lacke no ky^de of virtue: and she yt does not so / shall have no virtue
at al. O reverent power of ye divine word / which in three words has
co^p^he^ded as much as mortal me^ go about to exp^sse: nor yet ca^ not with long
sermons. Wherefore I will make no^e other law of marriage: for only this is
sufficient: only this co^teyneth as much as either ma^s wit can co^ceyue / or
man's eloquence can utter. Therefore ye woman shall not believe my fa^tasye / but
ye first father of our ky^d Ada^: or rather obey Christ / co^mau^dyng i^ ye
gospel of Mattheu / yt they shall be two i^ one person. And tha^ has she
fulfilled al ye duty of a virtuous wife. This one precepte of god might have
eased me of allabour of writy^g / if ye it had e^tred so deep i^ to wome^s
hearts yt they might both have well perceived it / and bear in my^de / and
executed it. But now to the^te^t that it may stick more fast / and grow
more surely / it must be turned and handled many ways / and be made i^ many
fasho^s / and so be set before their eyes and taught unto them / that they may
both take and keep it ye bett. Not wtstandyng a wise woman shall remember / yt
all yt ever I say is but one p^cepte / as it were one man in diverse apparel.

Of.ii. the greattest points in a married woman. The.iij. Chaptre.
Among all other virtues of a married woman.ij. there ought to be most
special and greatest: the which only if she have them / may cause marriage to
be sure / stable / durable / easy / light / sweet / and happy: and again / if
the one be lacked: it shall be unsure / paynfull / unpleasant / and intolerable
/ yea and full of myserye / and wretchedness. These two virtues / that I mean
/ be chastity and great love toward her husband. The first she must bring
with her forth of her fathers house. The second she must take after she is
ones entered in at her husbands door / and both father and mother / kyns
folks / and all her friends left / she shall reken to find all these in
only her husband. And in both these virtues she shall represente the image of
holy church: which is both most chaste and most faithfully does keep
truth and promise unto her spouse Christ: which being solicited / and
labored within of so many wowers / that is to say / christen folks / that
have been commyn heritickes / and besyged without of pagans and Jews: yet never
has been won nor corruptedde: and has ever rekenedde all her good and
treasure to rest in her only spouse Christ. A married woman ought to be of
greatter chastity than an unmarried. For if that thou than pollute and defile
thy chastity / as god forbede thou should / herke I pray the / how many
thou shalt offend and displease atones / with one wicked deed: How many
reue^gers thou shalt provoke against the. They be so many and so henus / that
among some a man can make no difference / but I shall gether them without any
order / and set them before their eyes. First thou offe^dest.ij. Which ought
to be unto the both most in price / and most dear and best / that is to say /
almighty god / by whose means ye were coupled to gether / and by whose deite
thou haste made oath to keep the pureness of body. And next unto god thou
offendeste thine husband: unto whom only thou have given thy self: in whom
thou breakest all loves and charites / if thou ones be defiled. For thou art
unto him as Eve was unto Adam: that is to say his daughter / his sister / his
companion / and his wife / and as I might say another him self. Wherefore thou
desperate woman that have abused thy self so / thou farest in like manner as
though thou h^^deste strangled / distroyed / or murdered thy (...). Thou have
broken the greatteste band that can be in the world: Thou haste broken thou
false woman the most holy band of temporal law: yt is to say / thy faith and
thy troth / which ones given / one enemy in the feelde will keep to another
/ though he should stand in danger of death: and thou like a false wretch
doste not keep it to thyn husband: which ought to be more dear unto the by
right / than thy self. Thou defylest ye most pure church / which help to
couple the: thou breakeste worldely company: thou breakest the laws: thou
offendest thy country: thou beatest thy father with a bitter scurge: thou
beatist thy sorrowful mother / thy systers / thy brethren / thy kyns folks /
alyances / and all thy friends: thou gyueste unto thy company ons an example
of myschiefe / and castest an everlasting blotte and shame upon thy kynne: thou
/ like a cruel mother / castest thy children in to such a necessite / that
they can never here speak of their mother / without shame / nor of their father
/ without doutynge. What greatter offense can they do: or what greatter
wyckednes can they infecte them self withal / that distroye their country /
and perisshe all laws and justice / and mourther their fathers and mothers /
and finally defyle and mar all things / both spiritual and temporal? What
good saint / or god / or what man thynkest thou can favor the / that doste so?
All thy country folks / all ryghtes and laws / thy country hit self / thy
parents / all thy kynsfolke / and thine husband him self shall damn and
pu^^^^he the: All mighty god will avenge most rygh^^usly his majesty so
displeased and offended of the. And know thou this / woman / yt the chastity
and honest / which thou have / is not thine / but committed / and betake^
unto thy keeping by thine husband. Wherefore thou do the more wrong to give
away that thing / which is an other bodies / without the ownuers license. And
therefore the married woman of Lacerdemon / when a young man desired of her that
dishonest thing / answered him: I would grant the thine asking young man / if
it were mine own to give that thou ask: but that thing / which thou
would have / while I was unmarried was my fathers / and now is mine
husbands. She made him a merry and a wise answer. But saint Paul speaks full
wisely for the monition of good women / where he techeth the church of god /
saying: A woman has no power of her own body / but her husband. Which
saying ought so much to keep a woman / except she be to ungracious / from
all fylthy actis / that saint Augustine does not allow perpetual chastity in a
married woman / without her husband be content with the same. Wherefore there is
an holy man / whether it be saint Hieronyme or some other I wot not well /
that dispreyseth one Celantia a virtuous woman and a good wife / because she
auowed perpetual chastity without her husbands consent. For a woman has no
power on her own body / no not unto the goodness of continence. Now than let
every man consider what license she has that while unto the noughtynes of ^^y^
behauynge her body / she is discommended for chastity / her husband not
being of counsel. Now than / what shall she have / that commytteth adultery
against her husbands will? Herke what words this holy man says: But this I
have understand also / which trowbleth and greueth me not a little / that
thou haste taken upon the that good purpose of chastity / without thine
husbands will / clean contrary to the commandment of the apostell: which
in this case commands / not only the wife to be subject to the husband /
but also the husband to the wife. The wife says he / has no power on her
own body but her husband: Like wise the husband has no power of his own
body / but his wife: and thou / as though thou had forgotten the bond of
marriage / nor remembryng thy bargeyne and promise / haste made a vow of
chastity to god / thine husband unknowing / but it is ieoperdie to promise
that / the which is in an others power. And I can not think that gift very
pleasant unto god / where one gives away that / which perteyneth unto.ij.
Thus says this holy man: which if he take up so sharply this virtuous
woman for an holy thing gyuyng / which was not in her power for to give / what
words suppose ye / would he use / in rebukynge a wicked or a fylthy deed? And
that thou may understand more plainly / how great a vice adultery is
rekened / both of god and man / Christ in his gospel / where he would
algates that men shall keep their wives / nor deuorse from them for none
occasion: yet he does except adultery. Therefore a man must be co^te^t with his
wife / though she be a dro^karde / though she be ireful / though she be shrewde
/ a waster / a glotten / a vacabonde / as kowlder / a rayler / only an
adulterar is at a man's liberty to forsake. Also the other vices be
displeasant in deed / but yet they may be suffered: but she that breaks the
promise of wedlock / is intolerable. Wherefore Homer the poet / among the
cursings and bannynges / that he gives unto certain men / puts this for
one of the forest: I pray god says he / their wives mutte meddle with other
men. Also Job prays / that if ever he lay in wait to do his friends
displeasure / this misfortune might light upon him / saying: I pray god my wife
may be an other man's harlotte: and other men mutte lie down upon her. And
these points did not only holy christen women understand / but also pagannes:
of whom there were some / which after they were corrupted / thought them self
unworthy for to live / as Lucrecia / wife unto Collatyne: whose act is most
famous / for the marvelous love that she had unto chastity: and many moo /
which lest they should lose their chastity / perysshed them self. What time
ye cite of Athens was won by Lisander the king of Lacedemon / and xxx.
tyra^tes were set to govern the cite / and they ruled most proudely and
hautely / and iaped and mocked the honesty of many women / the wife of
Niceratus slew her own self to escape / that she should not be at their
fylthy pleasure. Also the wives of the Almannes / of whom Caius Marius had
slain an infynite multitude / desired him / that they might be given unto the
religious maids of Rome / called the virgins of Vesta / saying / that they
would live as chastely as they should: Which thing when they could not
obtain of that hard stomach of Marius / all in the night next ensuyng
hanged them self. Also in ye war / which the people of Phoces had with ye
Thessaly ans / and the Thessalians came in to their country with an incredeble
power / Deiphantus the chiffe captain of the Phoceance / counsayled the
people to go against their enemies: but as for children / their wives / and
aged me^ / with other / that were not able to bear harneis / to shut them up
in some secret place / and to bring them plente of wodde and straw / that
and if ye ooste were over come / they there might burn them self. Now when
most part of the people consented to the same / there rose up an aged man /
which said: It were well done to wit the wome^nes will in that matter: that
if they agreed thereto / than should it so be: if not / he said hit was
unreasonable / to apoynt them such a thing against their will: where upon the
women were examyned / which answered all to gether / that they were very well
agreed / with Deiphantus counsel / and also gave him great thanks / because
he had so well provided for the safegarde of them and of their country: and
upon this purpose they were conveyed in to a secreate place: Now be it the
Phocians returned again with the victory: nor I doubt not / but it was
through the merit of the good women. And thus did pagans / which lived in the
obscurite and darkness of ignorance. Wherefore christen folks may be the more
ashamed / which be redeemed with the blood of our lord / washed with baptism
/ instructed with doctrine / and illumyned with light.

How she shall behave her self unto her husband. The.iiii. Chaptre.
HIt were alonge matter and hard to express / and thereto wo^derous / if I
should rehearse every point of the wives duetye unto her husband: Our lord
comprehends it in the gospel with one word. Therefore let us remember / how
we have said before / that she is as one body with her husband. Wherefore she
ought to love him none other wise than her self. I have said before / and
often shall again: For this is the great test virtue of a married woman: this is
the thing that wedlock signifies / and commands that the wife should
rekenne to have her husband for both father / mother / brethren / and
systers / like as Adam was unto Eve / and as the most noble and chaste woman
Andromache said her husband Hector was unto her / in these words:

Thou art unto me both father and mother
Mine own dear husband / and well-beloved brother.
And if it be true that men do say / that frenshyp makes one heart of two:
Much more trewelye and effectually ought wedlock to do ye same / which far
passes all manner both frendshyppe and kynred. Therefore hit is not said that
wedlock does make one man / or one mind / or one body of two / but clearly
one person. Wherefore the words that the man spoke of the woman / saying / for
her sake a man should leave both father and mother / and bide with his wife /
the same words the woman ought both to say and think with more reason. For
all though there be one made of two / yet the woman is as daughter unto her
husband / and of nature more weaker. Wherefore she nedethe his aid and
succoure. Wherefore if she be destitute of her husband / desert / and left
alone / she may sone take hurt and wrong. Therefore if she be with her
husband / where he is / there has she both her country / her house / her
father / her mother / her friends / and all her treasure: of the which thing
Hipsicratea / wife unto Mithridates the king of Pontus / gave good example /
which followed her husband in man's aparayle / when he was beaten and driven
out of his land / fleyng still from one place unto an other / not having /
where to reforte or abide: and where so ever he was / she acompted there to be
her riches / her realm / and her country. Which thing doubtless was the
greattest comfort and ease of his sorrow and aduersite. Flaccilla / wife unto
Nouius Priscus / and Egnatia Maximilla wife unto Glitto Gallus / both followed
their husbands out of their country / when they were banysshed / with great
loss of treasure and possessions: And they rekened their husbands far above
al those unto them. Wherefore their names were had in great honor. Also Tauria
deserved no less commendation / which wha^ her husband was outlawed / hid
him up between the silyng and the roffe of her chamber / no moo of counsel
but one maid and her self: and so saved his life with her own great
ieoperdy. Also Sulpitia wife unto Lentulus / wha^ her mother Tullia watched her
diligently lest she should follow her husband / that was banyshed / she got
upon her pour raiment / and so with.ij. maid servants / and as many men /
stale away and came to her husband: nor refused to banyshe her own self for
his sake / that her husband might se in his outlawry her faythfulnes toward
him. And there have been very many / that had leauer be in ieoperdye them
self / than their husbands should. The wife of Fernando Gonzalis therle of
Castile / when the king of the Legion of Germany / which is a cite in the
part of Spain called Astury / had her husband in prison / she came unto
her husband / as it were to visit him / and there counsayled her husband to
change rayme^t with her / and steal his way / and leave her in the ieoperdye
that should fall: and so he did. Wherefore the king wondryng upon that great
love of hers toward her husband / prayed god to send him and his children
such wives / and so let her go again to her husband. There was also an other
of the same kynredde / which was married unto a certain king of England /
that what time her husband in war against the Syryans / had catched a great
wound in his arm with a venomed sword / and so came home in to his own
country / nor could never be healed / except that venom and matter were
sucked out: The king seeing that who so ever should do that deed / were in
ieoperdy of their life / would suffer no man to take it upon him. Wherefore in
the night when he was a sleep / his wife losed the bands of the wound /
first her husband not perceiving / and after ward dissemblyng / and so by
little and little sucked and spitted out the poison / and prepared the wound
curable and ready to the physician. Wherefore I am very sorry / yt I have not the
name of that noble woman / which were worthy to be commended with most
eloquent praises. How be it / it is not unspoken of / for it is read in the
acts of Spain / which Rodericus the bisshope of Tolet did write: From whense
I shall ones translate with honorable mention of her. Like wise upon a season
men of Tyrthena came a great meny out of their i will unto Lacedemo^ / whom yt
Lacedemonyans suspected to go about some subtilte / and there upon set them in
hold / and judged them to dye. Wherefore their wives gate license of the kepers
for to go in unto them / as it were to visete and comfort them / and there
changed raiment with them / and so they in the women's raiment / and their faces
covered / as the custom of the country was / escaped away / and left their
wives behind them: whom afterward with their children to gether they
recovered again / and put all the Lacedemonyans in fear / as Plutarke
writes. More over Admetus the king of Thessaly / having a disease raynynge
upon him / which could never be healed / without the death of an other body /
could find none / that would gladly die for his sake / but his wife Alcest.
Also many there has been / which after their husbands death / would in no
wife abide on live. Laodamia / after she had hard tell that her husband
Prothesilaus was slain at Troy of Hector / she kylde her self, And Paulina /
wife of Senec / would feign have died with her husband / and had her veins
cut / as he had / but she was let by Nero and holden against her will / till
her armies were bound / and her blood stopped: nor she lived not many years
after: And while she was alive / was so pale and so lean with sorrow / that
she was a wonder to every man to look upon: and in all the state of her body
shewedde manifest tokens of the kind love that she had to her husband. The
daughter of Demotion / the chief man of Areopagites / a yo^ge maid / wha^ she
hard tell of the death of her spouse Leosthenes / she slew her self:
affyrmy^g / that all though she was untouched / yet because she was married unto
him in mind / she should be adulteter / if she married unto any other
afterward. Old writers of stories tell / that Halcione would not abide on
live after the death of her husband Ceyx: And therefore she lepte down in to
the sea. The fables of poets / which were made to instruct out lyuy^ges /
add more unto the tale / that they were changed in to birds called Alciones:
and so well beloved of the gods Thetis / that when so ever these birds
build / there is great caulmenes in the sea / and fair wether in ye air: and
that chaunseth yearly at certain times. Wherefore for those days he called in
laten Halcionii / that is as you would say / the Halcyon birds days: and that
gift they say / the goddis gave for the great love of that woman toward her
husband. Euadna / when she kept the funeral of her husband / she lepte in
to the fire and followed her husband. Cecinna Petus had a wife called Arria /
this Cecinna / when he had risen in battle with Scribonian against Claudius
the emperor / and was brought to Rome / Arria desired the sodiours to let her
wait upon her husband as a servant: which thing when they would not suffer
/ she hired a fysshers boot / and followed the great ship. And within a few
days after the death of her husband / killed her self at Rome: and yet had
she a daughter on live married unto Thrasea / the most noble and wysest man in
his time. Portia daughter of Cato / wife unto Marcus Brutus / wha^ her husband
was slain / she sought for her own death: and when weapons were taken from
her / she thruste hot coals in her mouth / and choked her self. Panthia /
wife of king Susius kept her faith unto her husband / being in captivity /
and spended out all her goodis for his life: And when he was slain in battle
/ she dyed voluntarily after him. The daughter of Julius Caesar / which was
married unto Pompey the great / when one brought upon a time home out of the
feelde a cote of her husbands be bloded / she suspecty^g that her husband had
be wounded / fell to the ground in swonynge / and almost deed: with the
which aflyghte of her mind / she fell to labor of child a fore her time /
and so dyed. Also Cornelia / the last wife of the same Pompei / said: Hit was
shame for a woman / that could not dye with only sorrow when her husband was
slain. Arthemisia / the queen of Lyde / did drink the ashes of her husband
/ after his death / because for very love she would have her own body to be her
husbands grave. These great things have I rehearsed / that women that be now
a days may be ashamed / whithe will not endeavor them self to perform other
more easy things. Wherefore their cruelte and wickedness is more intolerable /
that can fy^de in their hearts to se their husbands lie in trowble / damage /
and worldly shame / and all ye sorrow that can be for a small money / when
they have inoughe in stoore to rydde them out of dangere.

O heart more harder than any beast / that canste suffer thy blood / thy body /
and thine own self on thy husbands part / to be so vexed: Doutles the laws
that suffer that iniquite / have more regard of money than feith or conscience.
But this manner has been left us of the pagans / with many other / which
abide more surely in us / than ye law of Christ does allow: which
commands us to lay forth both clothyng / metal / and what treasure so over
we have in store / not only the wife for her husband / but also one christen
man for another / be he never so unknown. Wherefore let the woman understand
/ that if she will not spe^de all her substance to save her husband from never
so little harms / she is not worthy to bear ye name / neither of a good / nor
christen woman / nor ones to be called a wife: Neither I would yt she should
love her husband / as one loves his friend / or his brother / that is to say
/ I will that she shall give him great worship reverence / great obedience /
and service also: which thing not only thexa^ple of the old world teaches
us / but also all laws / both spiritual and temporal / and Nature her self
cries and commands / that ye woman shall be subject and obedyent to the man.
And in all kinds of beastis the femals obey ye malles and wayten upon them /
and fawn upon them / and suffer them self to be corrected of them: which
thing Nature shows must be / and is convenient to be done. Which as
Aristotel in his book of beastis shows / has given less strength and power
unto the femalles of all kinds of beastis / than to the males / and more soft
flesh / and tender hear. More over / these parts / which nature has given
for weapons of defense unto beastis / as tethe / horns / spores / and such
other / the most part of females lack / which their males have / as hearts
and bores. And if any females have any of these / yet be they more stronger in
the males / as horns of bullis be more stronger than of kyne. In all the
which things Nature shows / that ye males duty is to succor and defend /
and the femals to follow and to wait upon the male / and to crepe under his
aid / and obey him / that she may live the better. But let us leave ye
examples of beastis / which make us ashamed of our self without we pass them
i^ virtue / and let us ascend up unto man's reason. Now than / what woman
will be so presumptuous and so haute / to disobey her husbands bidding / if
she consider that he is unto her in steed of father and mother and all her
kynne / and that she owes unto him / all the love and charity that were due to
them all? A ragious and a folisshe woman does not consider this / the which is
disobedyent unto her husband. Except parauenture she would say / she owes
none obedience / neither to father nor to mother / nor to none of her kynne.
For if she obey them / she must needs obey her husband: in whom by all rightes /
by all customs / by all statutes and laws / by all precepts and
commandments / both natural / worldely / and heavenly / she ought to
acompte all thing to be. The woman is not rekened the more worshipful among
men / that presumes to have mastrye above her husband: but the more folisshe
/ and the more worthy to be mocked: Yea and more over than that cursed and
unhappy: the which tourneth backewarde the laws of nature / like as though a
sodioure would rule his captain / or the moon would stand above the son /
or the arm above the heed. For in wedlock the man resembles the reason / and
the woman the body: Now reason ought to rule and the body to obey / if a man
will live. Also saint Paul says: The heed of the woman is the man. Here now I
enter in to the divine commandments / which in stomachs of reasonable
people / ought of reason to bear more rule and valewe / than laws / more
than all man's reasons / and more than the voice of nature her self. God the
maker of this holle world / in the beginning when the world was yet but rude
and new / gyuynge laws unto mankind / he gave this charge unto the woman.
Thou shalt be under thyn husbands rule / and he shall have dominion over the.
The Apostle Paul / teacher of the Christen wisdom / that is for to say / of
the heavenly wisdom / would not have the woman to rule the man / but
commands her in many places to be subject. Peter also / the prince of the
apostles / commaundethe in this wise: Let all women be subject to their
husbands / as holy women / trusting in our lord. Sara was obedient unto
Abraham / and called him her lord. Saint Hieronyme writes unto Celantia in
this wise: Let the auctorite and rule be reserved unto thyn husband: and be
thou an example to all thine house / what soueraynetie they owen unto him: Do
thou prove him to be lord by thyn obedience / and make him great with thine
humilite: For the more honor thou gyuest unto him / the more honorable thou
shall be thy self. For as the Apostle says / the heed of a woman is the man.
Now the holle body can no where have more honor / than of ye heed / this
says saint Hieronyme. But folysshe women do not se / how sore they dishoneste
them self / that take the soueraynte of their husbands: of whom all their
honor must come: And so in seeking for honor / they lose it: For if the
husband lack honor / the wife must needs go without it: Neither kynred /
riches / nor welthe can a veil her. For who will give any honor to that man /
whom he sees mastred by a woman. And again / if thy husband be honorable /
be thou never so low of birth / never so pour / never so uncomely of face /
yet canste thou not lack honor: for neither beauty / kynred / nor riches
made Orestilla honorable / after she was ones married to ungracious Catiline:
nor pouerte let not Salonia to be honored of ye Romans / which was wife
unto the wise Cato. But now that thou may better obey thy husband / and do
all things after his mind / first thou must learn all his manners / and
consider well his dispositio^s and state: For there be many kinds of husbands
/ and all ought to be loved / honored / and worshipped / and obeyed / but all
must not be e^treated under one manner: For husbands must be handled / as
Terence speaks / after thopinion of Plato / saying: Man's life is as it were a
game at the tables: For if that chance of the dyce / that is not for them / hit
must be amended by crafty playeng: like wise in husbands / if thou have one
after thyn appetite / thou may be glad / and he is to be honored / and
obeyed: but if he be ill / either find some craft to make him good / or at yt
least wise better to deal with. Now thy husband shall be either fortunate or
unfortunate: Fortune I call them that have goodness either of mind or of body
/ or external: Unfortunate I call those / that lack any of these three: they
that be fortunate / do easily content their wives minds: and those that be
unfortunate must have delyberation taken about them: how be it / I would they
should rather set their love on the husband himself / than on his fortunes
/ or else they shall love both weakly and more vnstedfastly: and if fortune
ones flee away / as she is wauery^g and inco^stant / she carries away the love
to gether with her. Nor let them not love goodly men for their beauty / nor
rich men for their money / nor men of great auctorite for their honor: for
if they do so / than shall they hate the sekely / the pour / and those that
bear no rule. If thou have a learned husband / learn good holy lesso^s of him:
if he be virtuous / do after him: but if he be unfortunate / call unto
remembrance the saying of Pompeius the great / a very noble and a wise man /
which when he was over comen of Julius Caesar / and came unto ye I Will of Lesbo
to receive his wife / and flee away with her / she seeing her husband beaten
and ouercomen / fell unto ye ground halffe deed for sorrow / to se her
husband have such a fall: whom Pompeius lyftyng up in his arms from the
ground / and reuied again / spoke unto her in this manner: My dear wife
Cornelia / most sweet unto me of all things / I wonder of the so noble a
woman to be over commen in such manner at the first stroke of Fortune: now
thou have an occasion to obtain immortal honor: For as for eloquence / or
lernyng in the law / or feattes of war are no matters for women to win
worship by / her virtue shall only appear if her husband be cast in
aduersite / whom if she love and worship / nor loathe his mysery / but entreat
/ as is becommyng to do her husband / the world shall talk good of her
perpetually. Wherefore it shall be greatter honor to the to love Pompeius thus
over thrown / than when he was the prince of all the Romans / and gouernoure
of the Senate / and lord of kings. For as for these things every woman / be
she never so ungracious / can love well enough / but to fauore and love him
that is in aduersite / there is the poy^t of a good woman. Therefore that I am
thus ouercommen thou ought to love / as an occasion to show thy goodness.
Wherefore if thou weep and wayle for any thing as long as I live / thou show
thy self to love that / which thou lackest and haste lost: and not to mourn
for me that am a live. These and such other words he spoke unto his wife at
that time: which saying every good woman shall ponder and considre in her
mind: nor vex her self / if she chance upon an unfortunate husband:
neither hate nor despise him therefore: but rather contrary / she ought / if he
be pour / to comfort him / and advertise him to call unto remembrance / that
virtue is ye chief riches: and help him with such honest crafts as she
knows shall please him: and such as her acqueintance and friends shall
allow: and as is becommyng for a virtuous and an honest woman. But beware thou
fall not in to such a wicked mind / to will him for lucre of money to occupye
any dishonest crafts / or to do any unhappy deeds / that thou may live more
delycately / or more welthely / or go more gayly and gorgiously arayde / or
dwell in more goodly housyng: and at few words / compel not him to use any
fylthy occupation or drogery for thy welfare / nor to sweet and to toil / yt
you may lie at ease: For hit were better for ye to eat brown bread and
drink claye and myry water / tha^ cause thy husband to fall unto any slubbery
work / or stynkyng occupation / and excedyng labor / for to escape thy
scoldyng and chydyng at home. For the husband is his own ruler / and his
wives lord / and not her subject / neither the wife ought to crave any more
of her husband / than she sees she may obtain with his heart and good will:
wherein / many women do a mysse / which with their ungoodly cryeng and
unreasonable calling / crauynge / and dullyng upon them / dryueth them to seek
unlawful means of living / and to do ungracious deeds / to bear out with all
their glotony and vain pride: And some be so out of all good reason / and
contrary to all good virtues of their husbands / that they spend out at
large their substance and living. Which vice is the fouler / by cause that
woman kind pretends more virtue and devotion naturally than the mankind
does: if that she should forgette her self / and cast away all holiness for
the love of money / and such wives before rebuked in holy scripture / under
the persons of the wives of Job and Thoby: Which casted folyshly in their
husbands tethe / that their virtues and holy living was the cause of their
aduersyte: wherein they showed great wickedness / and not only folly: which did
not believe that the riches of virtue was far greatter / or that hit stood in
our lords power to make most rich and welthye with in a moment / who so ever
pleased him. What needs a man any other tyra^tes to his marterdome / tha^
wives of such disposition / which pursue their husbands for their good
devotion / being them self without all devotion / none otherwise / than Nero
pursued the apostles / or Domician / Maximine / Detius / or Dioclecta^ did
pursue other christian folks in their time? And I suppose that this wife of Job
was left him to make his aduersyte more payneful / and to oppress him the
sorer with her myscheuous tongue. O cursed and wicked woman / that rebukest thy
husband for his goodness / which thing the devil him self dourste never do
/ for he distroyed all the goods of Job / stowe his servants / rydde up his
children out of the world / and filled him full of galls and scabbes: yet did
he never rebuke him / for continuyng still in his good mind: but his wife
rebukedde him therefore / that a man might se how much she was more bold than
the devil. But let the wife trouble never so much / the husband ought to be
as glad thereof / as were the apostles / that they were rekened worthy to be
put to rebuke for the name of our lord Jesus: but thou good daughter / that
wylt do well / shall not withdraw thyn husband from goodness / but rather
exhort him unto virtue / though thou shuldeste be sure to lees all thy
goods. Therefore / that thou may opteyne the thing / which saint Paul
speaks of / saying: If the husband be an infidel / he shall be sanctified
by his wives says / remember also the words of our lord / that there is no
body that refuses any thing in this world for Christis sake / but he shall
have much more for hit: both in this world and in an other. First these
riches be sure and certain / which are kept saffe from all chau^ses / neither
wasted within / as mettalles be by ruste and clothing by moughtes / nor without
as stolen by thieves. And also the prophet in the psalm says: that he has
learned by long use and by good experience / that never good man was yet
destytute / nor any of his children lacked food. And we have as it were an
obligation of our lord in the gospel / that we shall trust well on his
benygnyte. And understand that our father in heaven will find us all thy^g /
that we shall need / if we seek for his kingdom / and the justice thereof.
Wherefore if thine husband be foul / yet love his heart and mind / where unto
thou art married in deed. And if thine husband be sick / than must thou play
the true wife / comfort him / norysshe him / and make as much of him / as
though he were never so holle and so strong / and so shall he be the less
payned / if he sethe / as it were / take pain with him: and in a manner
translate and chifte part of his syckenes unto thy self. For she is no good
wife / that is merye when her husband is sorye: or holle and lustye / wha^ he
is sick and heuye: bide thou still by his beddis side / and lighten his
doloure sometime with comfortable words / sometime with gentle fomentations.
Touch thou his wou^des thy self / touch thou his sore and paynfull body
with thine own hands. Do thou both cover and uncover him thyn own self:
take and bear away the chamber vessel with his water thy self. Nor aborre not
these services: nor put them not unto thy servants / which will go more
slowly about them / because they love him not so much. And when the pacient
perceyueth him self not loved / his sickness increases. Now than should a
man call those wives good and virtuous women / that be so careless in their
husbands syckenes / that they can be well enough content with such slight
services as her servants do about him. And some there be / that will nothing
let their accustomed stations / and feastynges / and visettyng their gossyppes
/ nor break any of their haunted pleasures / though their husbands lie shut
up sick at home / but that is no wedlock / but rather a point of concubynes /
or common harlottes: which lie with men for their wages. Wherefore should I be
ashamed to name that / which the ungracious women shame not to do. For if thou
think it makes no force / nor order thy self other wise in thine husbands
sickness / than if it were but thy neighbor / thou art a fool to look after
/ that I should name the for a wife / when thou vseste no wives gyse. For
would thou I should name the for a wife / when thou use no wives manners?
For should I call him a weauer that never learned to weaue / nor to draw the
woffe / nor to cast the shuttyll / nor strycke the web with the slaye?

Though that virtue by hit self can not fail to come to light / and shyneth
well mough in ye dark by the bryghtnes of hit self / not withstanding / as
much as lyethe in me / I will not suffer / but that that I have seen my self
/ and many mo know as well as I / I will declare / that both they that now
be / and they that shall come here after / may know it. Clare the wife of
Barnarde Valdaure / a fair and a goodly maid / when she was first married at
Bruges / and brought to bed unto her husband / which was.xlvi. year of age /
ye first night saw his legs rolled and wrapped with cloutes / and found
that she had chaunsed on a sore and a sekely husband: yet for all that / she
lothed him never the more / nor begane not to hate him / whom yet she had no
space to love. Not long after that / the forsayde Valdaure fell in to a great
sickness / in so much / that all physicians dispayred his life: than she and
her mother gave such dilygence unto the seek man / that of syx wekes
contynually to gether / neither of them ones put of their clothes / except it
were to change their smockes: nor rested in the night paste one hour /
or.iij. at the most / and that but in their clothes. The root of the disease
was that we call the french pockes / a wondrous sore / and contagious
sickness / physicians counsayled her / not to touch him so / nor come so nere
him: and the same her fre^des cou^sayled her. And her co^panyo^s and gossyppis
said: it was synfully done / to vex the man in the world / or keep him
longer on live with his sickness / and bad her provide some good thing for the
soul / as for the body care no more / but how it might be buried: with which
saying she was never a whytte abashed / but very dilygently procured both
such as was for the welthe of his soul / and prepared wholesome meats for his
body: and gave great intendaunce about him / often chau^gyng his shetes / and
his cloutes / because he had an excedyng laxe / and matter / and fylthe ran
out of diverse parts of his body: Wherewith she was so busyed / that ye most
part of the day she never rested / but ra^ne up and down all the day long.
So at the last by the good means of his wife / Valdaure escaped the great
ieoperdye / that both the physicians / and all other men swered / his wife
had plucked him from death by strong hand. And some tested more merrily than
becomes christen folks / and said / that god had purposed to have slain
Valdaure / but his wife would not let him go out of her hands. After that / by
the reason of an hot humor rennynge from his heed / the grystle within his
nose began for to canker: Wherefore the physicians had given him a powder /
which must be blowe^ in with a pen or a read in to his nose / which
service when every man abhorred / because of the tedious savor / his wife
refused not to do hit. Also within a while his chekes and his chy^ne brake out
of scabbes / wheales / and of skales / that no harbor / neither well could /
nor gladly would shave him: than his wife with a pair of scyssours / found
the means to clippe his berde wo^derous properly. Straight after he fell in to
an other long disease / which lasted nere.vij. year: where she never being
weary / with contynuall dilygence and labor about him / prepared his meat /
and every day did salve and bind his sore and stynkyng legs and rounnyng of
matter so hansomly / that thou would say / if thou had seen her / that
she had handled musk / and not such stynky^g gear. And did all this her own
self with all other busynes / that was for to do about him: and yet had she
in her house.iij. maids and a daugher of her own of good age. Moreover wha^
ye air of him and brethe was such / that no man might abide nere by.x.
passes: she would swear that she thought hit marvelous sweet: And ones she was
very a^grie with me / because I said it stanke / for she said / it seemed unto
her / like the savor of ripe and sweet fruit. Moreover / when there was
required great cost daily in the house / to help and norisshe the man
opressed with so many sickenesses / nor had neither rentes nor other
profittis coming in / she spoiled her self of all her rings / chaynis /
broches / and clothes lest he should lack ought dury^g his sickness: she was
content as for her self with any fare / so that her husband might have that
should do his paynful body good / so he by the means of his wife / with that
doleful body / more like unto a grave / tha^ a body / continued.x. year from
the begynny^g of his sickness / in the which space she had two children by him
/ and.vj. before. For she was married.xx. year in the holle: and yet was she
never infected / nor ones touched with the contagious skabbe / neither she /
nor yet none of her children / but had all their bodies both holle and clean.
Whereby a man may clearly perceive / how much their holiness and virtue is
worth / that love their husbands with all their hearts as duty is / which
doubtless god will never leave unrewarded. So at the last this forsaid man died
sick and old / and passed out of his contynuall pain. For whose departing
this same Clara his wife made such sorrow / that all that ever knew her /
say / they never saw woman make such sorrow for her husband / that were
both young / holle / fair / lusty / and rich: and when diverse came to her /
not for to comfort her / but rather to show her / that they were glad for her
sake / that he was gone she abhorted / and in a manner cursed them for their
labor / wysshynge many times that she might have him again if it were
possible / how so ever he were / and when she was of lusty age / after his
death / yet she would never mary / saying: she should never mete with any that
she could like so well / I will not rehearse here her great chastity and
holiness of living. For I speak but of ye love of a good wife: which never
lightly gothe alone / but ever coupled / and co^panyed with all other virtues.
Who sees not now that she did not marie Valdaures body / but his heart / or
else rekened his body her own body? Beside that / she keeps still all
commandments of her husband / as reuerentlye as he were yet a live / and
does many things as she had hard him speak in his life / saying / this mine
husband would have commanded and bid den do. O Euryppides / if thou had
had such a wife / thou would have preysed all women as fast as thou haste
dispreysed them. Or if king Agamemnon had had such a queen / she would have
tarried many years for his retournyng from the sige of Troy. These examples
ought not to be kept vnshewed / to remember wives of their duetye / seeing that
less matters be put in memory and writynge. But these be but of folks of
low degree / will some gentle women say. First to make answer thereto: Clara
Valdaure was not of the loweste degree / and beside that young / and tender /
and fair / and had many servants / unto whom she might have deputed all her
busynes / if it had pleased her. And there be many noble women that do the same
/ whom I can not rehearse all / both now a live and that has been in times
paste. But this world of ours keeps in use only the vices of the old worlds
before. Art thou more noble than the wife of Themistocles / which was prince
of Athenes / and also of all Greece: and yet she served her husband her self
always in his sickness? Art thou more noble thanne Stratonica / wife unto king
Deiotarus / which when her husband was sick / and an aged man / was both his
cook / his physician / and his surgian? Or art thou more noble thanne that
queen of England / which sucked her husbands wound? All the noble women of
Rome / used nor would never suffer any other to touch their husbands when they
were sick / but them self: whose examples there is none now a days to good
to take heed of. For answer me thou woman / that think the better than the
Romans / of whose blood who so ever was descended / was had in honor
through all the world: how be it the very nobylite is not to be counted by
blood and riches / the which rather stands in noble actis and virtue: and
thou with all thy gentrye shall lie unknown: when all the world perpetually
shall talk of them. Therefore bost not thou thy noble birth / whom either none
orels very few shall know / either in thy life or after thy death. But
parauenture thou would say / I brought goods and money moughe to make me
noble with. O thou fylthy and beastylly woman / that weneste thy self to be a
wife / because thou haste a man lyenge by thy side / weneste thou that wedlock
stands in that? Thou breakest the laws of god and Nature. For if thou
would touthe thine own body / being diseased / and look upon thy sores and
handle them / thou ought not to refuse to do the same unto thyn husband /
seeing that ye be both as one person. Therefore where is that same inseperate
mate / which thou pretendest / if thou sterte from him / when thou should
abide most nere? Wherefore understand / that thou do not thy duty / neither
to thy brother borne of one woman with the / nor thy father / that begotte the
/ neither thy mother / that bare the. Wherefore if thou be ashamed of that /
thou may like wise be ashamed of that thou do unto thy husband: Whom thou
ought to regard more than them all. And many leave their mothers lyenge
sick / nor love any body but them selfs / which were worthy to be loved of
no body else / and no more be they in deed. How often have we seen bestis with
out reason / ruled only by nature / one cherishe another / and the femall lycke
the sores of the male / as kyene / and dogs / lions / bears / and all other
both wild and came? And thou that art a woman / having reason beside thy
nature / which is more excellent tha^ all theirs / can not find in thin heart
either to touch or to se thyn husbands sotes / when thou haste stomach
enough to handle the byles and scabbes of thy concubyne: wherewith many has
been taken / that a man may well know ye not nature but their own
ungraciousness so does move them. Now to show further of my matter / if thy
husband were ill / yet ought thou to suffce him / nor strive with him / by
shrewdenes / lest thou never have end of sorrow and myschefe: but when he is
more pacified / tha^ give him warning by curtese and gentle means to amend
his living. And if he will do after thy saying / than shalt thou proffitte
both him and thy self: but if he begin to wax angrye / strive not with him
/ thou have done thy duetye: Therefore let him along and suffer him / and thou
shalt have not only great commendation before men / but also great merit
before god. And if he by unthrifty means of him self moved and hastynes
strycke or beat the / think it is the correction of god / and that it
chances the as a punishment for thy sins. And thou shalt be happy / if
thou may so with a little pain in this life / bye out the great pains of
an other world. How be hit there be but very few good and wise wives / whom
their husbands will beat / be they never so unhappy me^. Also some husbands
there be folisshe and wytles / whom a good wife will handle wisely inoughe /
and neither provoke them to anger / nor take from them the honor belongyng to
the man: but being him in good hope / that all thing shall be done after his
will. And for his profette shall rule him well enough by wisdom / as it were
a wild beast tamed: and in all points shall handle him in like manner as many
mothers do their children in like case / which have most co^passyon of them /
that be in most misery: of which compassion comes love and favor. Wherefore
they love and cherysshe more them that be feeble / maimed / folysshe / ill
favored / and sekely / than them that be strong / holle / wise / fair / and
lustye. I will not rehearse all other infortunes / I will give a general
precepte of all at ones. If thou be ones married unto him: and god / the church
/ thy father and mother / have given him to be thy husband and thy lord /
thou must suffer him / seeing thou can not change him / and love him /
worship and honor him: if thou will not for his own sake / at the least wise
for their sakes / that have given him unto the: and for the promise that thou
have made him / as many other do love them that be worthy no love / only for
their friends sakes / which has committed them unto their trust. And many do
because of their promise / things which else they would not. Therefore give thy
dilygence both to seem to do / and to do in deed / yt which thou must needs
do / be thou never so loathe: and so shall all those things be light and
pleasant unto the: which if thou be loathe to do / hit shall be grievous and
paynfull. Now I perceive that sum put doubts / how far they ought to
obey their husbands: verily in all things yt be either honest / or without
vice / there is no doubt but a woman ought to obey her husbands commandment
/ as a divine law. For the husband bears the room of god here in earth
unto his wife / and prese^teth his person. Therefore if there be any thing /
that the wife would give unto god / she neither ought nor may do hit without
her husbands license. For what may a woman reken to be more her own / than
her body and mind? And yet says saint Paul / that the woman has no power of
her own body / neither she can not a vow chastity unto god / her husband
either not willing / or not knowing. Wherefore if thyn husband would have the
other wise occupied / thou may not only not go forth to dau^ce or se plays /
or go to feastis / and pass time with gossyppes / which be points of common
harlottes: but thou may not as much as go pray or walk about to churches /
without his leave: or else be thou sure / that neither thy prayer is
pleasant unto god / nor thou shalt not find god in the church. God would
that thou pray and go to the church / but that is / wha^ thou have done thine
husbands busynes at home / and he has none other labor to set the about.
And these be the points of wedlock / which god lyketh best in a married
woman. For in his gospel / he byddeth a man be at one with his friend / or he
come nere his altar: how much more than / would he have the to be at one with
thyn husband / which far passes any friend? Whereto ghost thou to mass or
churches / when thine husband commands other wise / either by words
expressedlye / or by countinaunce preueyly? Wenest thou to find god in the
church when thou leauest thine husbade at home either sick or hungry? Thou
may fy^de all halowes about his bed / both aulters / god / peace /
concord / and charity / and specially where the man and wife be coupled with
these things. Thou shall sone make god thy friend / if thou make thine
husband thy friend before. God needs not much of our service. But virtuous
living / and high honor / them he reserueth unto him self / other things to
be kept in the world / as love and concord. And that is the cause why he
reherseth ^o often charity in his gospel / and says / he gives ^is kingdom
unto those / that have used charity unto folks in this world: and casts out
from the inheritance of heaven / that has been envious and malytious against
their even christen. For thou shalt easily make god thy friend / if thou
reconcile thine even Christen unto the before. Neither there is any way more
redye unto gods favor / than first to obtain favor of thine even
Christen. Therefore let a woman think that she does a great sacrifyce / when
she serves her husband: and think that she visetteth churches devoutly / if
she be diligent about her husbands bed. But there be some women / that if
their husband were never so sick / yet would they never let their walkyng of
their stations to churches about / and that more for their pleasure / than
devotion to god ward. But where to should we talk of them? Saint Paul
writing unto Tymothe speaks of womannes duete in this wise: Let the woman
learn with all obedyence / keeping silence. For I will not have the woman to be
a teacher / nor to rule her husband / but keep silence. Also writing unto the
Corinthies / he says: Let your women not speak in the church / but if
they list learn ought / that they be in doubt of / ask their husbands at
home. Which law in mine opinion means none other thing / but that the
woman ought to learn of her husband / and in such things as she stands in
doubt of / to follow his mind / and believe as he does: and if the husband do
wrong / him self shall bear all the blame / the wife shall be out of fault:
except it be so manifest that she may perceive the fault her self plainly
mough / or else be taught other wise of such as the husband him self might
well inoughe learn.

For those things that be against the laws of god / she ought not to do
though her husband command her never so much. For she must a knowledge one
for better than her husband and have more in price / that is Christ. The man
is heed of the woman / but Christ is heed of the man. Many holy women of our
faith have been sore punisshed of their husbands / for following Christ is
precepts against their will. And yet the apostle Paul command that he wife
not to depart from her husband without his leave / be he never so ungracious.
So great be the bonds of wedlock / that the Christen might not depart from
the hethen without leave. What than ought we to suppose / where both be
Christened / and both good? Aristotel says: A good woman ought to take the
manners of her husband / as a law and rule of her living / given her by god
by the couplynge of matrimony. And hit becomes her to accord with her
husband and serve him / not only in prosperity / but also in aduersite. If he
lack goods / or be sick of his body / or out of his mind / let her suffer
and obey him / except it be some uncleanly thing / or vncommelye. Nor let her
not bear long in mind / if her husband offend her / by reason of distress
of his mind: but lay the cause in his disease and ignorance. For the more
pacie^tly she uses him in these points / the more thank shall he give her /
when he is amended. And if there be any vncommely thing commanded her by him
/ which she has not done / he shall consydre that better after his amendynge.
Wherefore a woman ought to absteyne from ill / but in all good things / to
obey none other wise / than though she had been bought in to the house as a
bond and hand maid. And in deed she is boughte with a great price / that is
to say feloship of life / and procreation of children / which / nothy^g can be
greatter nor holyer. Moreover if she had had a welthy husband / than could not
her goodness been so much known. For hit is but a small act to handle
prosperity well. How be it to suffer aduersite patiently is counted a great
thing. For in great adversities and harms not to be in extreme despair / is
a point of a noble stomach. Therefore she had need to pray / that no harm
bechaunce her husband. But if any aduersite fall / than let her considre /
that she shall win great worship there by / if she behave her self well. And
let her remember / that neither queen Alcest should have had so great honor /
nor queen Penolepe so great praise / if they had lived in prosperity with their
husbands. For by the aduersite of king Admetus and Ulysses caused them
eternal memory. For in thaduersites of their husbands they optayned and that
well worthy / eternal glory / for keeping faith and truth toward their
husbands. For women will take no part of aduersite / except it be such as
be wondrous good. Wherefore to conclude / it is becomynge for the wife to have
her husband in honor / and not despise him. These be Aristotle's words.

Of the concord of married couples. The.v. Chaptre.
HIt were an infinite thing / nor the tale should come unto any end / to
rehearse the goodness of concord: and how all thing in the world / and also
the world it self / stands to gether by unity and concord: but our
purpose is to speak of wedlock: in which I say / ye greattest quietness and
most part of pleasure is concord / and the greattest trouble and most
part of misery in it is discord. They that were of Pythagoras disciplyne /
among all the precepts of Pythagoras / they kept these rules / and most /
and oftest used them. That la^guishenes should be voyded and put from the body
/ folly and lewdnes from the mind / ryotte from the bealye / and sedition out
of the cite / and discord out of the house / and finally intemperaunce out of
all things. Ulysses in Homer wishes for an husband / a house / and co^corde
unto Nausicaa the daughter of king Alcynous: which is the greattest treasure
and most to be desired that can be. For when the wife and husband live
peasably to gether / they cause much sorrow unto their enemies / much joy
unto their friends / and most of all unto them selves. Thus he said. How
happy a marriage suppose we yt Albutius had / which lived with his wife
Terrentiana without any displeasure.xxv. year: And yet more fortunate was
Publius Ceter / yt lived with Ennia his wife.xliiii. year without any grutchyng
or co^playnt. For of discord / comes debate / braulyng / chiding / and
fighting. And women be full of whynynge for the most part / and ill to
entreat: and often times wha^ they have chiden their husbands for a light
matter / it comes at last unto great disturbance. Nor there is nothing that
so sone casts the mind of the husband from his wife / as does much
scolding / and chydyng / and her myscheuous tongue / which Solomon lykeneth
unto a droppyng and rayny^g house rofe in the winter / because that both
dryueth the man forth at the door. And the forsayde Solomon says / that it is
better to dwell in a deserte and desolate country / than in house with a
chiding and an angry wife. And a few which be intolerable / give this
benifitte unto the holle kind / that none semethe good to deal with all: and
here of comes this saying: who so has no strife has no wife / as who say /
he that has a wife has strife. And that thing causes many / that be quietly
disposed never to marie. And therefore many things were written in old time in
the rebuke of woman kind / and diuorses sought out and sharply executed. And
now among christen men those things before myssed of many / and desired
after. For they say their wynes would be better / if they knew they might be
put away except they were gentle. In which opinion after my mind either the
men be disceyued / or the women be stark folys: which do not consydre / that
they had need to be the more obedient unto their husbands / that they might
live the more merilye with them / from whom they can by no means be
departed: lest they turn perpetual necessite in to mysery / which they can
never do away. For it rests much in ye wives hands to keep rest and
quietness in the house. For the man is not so yrefull as the woman. And that is
not in mankind only / but also in all kinds of beastis / as Aristotle
says. For the males / because they have more bold stomachs / and are more
lusty of courage / therefore be they more simple and less noisome / for they
have the more noble minds. And the females contrary be more malicius / and
more set to do harm, wherefore ye women will be taken with light suspiciousnes
/ and often complain and vex their husbands / and anger them with peuyshe
puelynge: but the man is easyer to reco^cile than the woman. Like wise as of
men he / whose is most like stomacked unto a woman / nor lusty coraged / will
remember injury / longest / and seek for vengeance the most violently / nor can
be co^te^t with a mean reue^gea^ce. There was in old time in Rome a chapel of
a certain gods / in which if any disturba^ce had been between the husband
and the wife at home / they spoke certain words what they list / and were
agreed again. And this gods was named Diciplaca / yt is to say / please
husband* which name shows that the husband ought not to study to please
the wife / but ye wife to please her husband. And though the best part of
these that I have spoken pertayne unto concord / yet will I bring some
things more nere unto that purpose. One the most chief and especial help
unto concord is if the wife love her husband. For this is the nature of love
to get love again: nor let not some wonder so much as they do / why their
husbands love them not / seeing they love not them / but look well lest they
love not their husbands so much as they make se^bla^ce. Let them love their
husbands in deed / and they shall be loved of them again. For feigned and
counterfeted love both shows hit self now and thanne / and has not the
very strength and virtue that the faithful love has. More over if the wife
and husband love together / they shall both will and nylle one thing /
which is the very and true love. For there can never be discord nor debate
between those / in whom is one heart / not desyryng contrary thing. And one
mind / not of contrary opinion. My mother Blau^che / when she had be.xv. year
married unto my father / I could never se her strive with my father. There
were.ii. sayenges that she had ever in her mouth / as proverbs. When she
would say she be leued well any thing / than used she to say / even as though
Lodowyke Viues had spoken it. When she would say that she would any thing /
she used to say / even as though Lodowyke Viues would hit. I have hard my
father say many times / but specially ones / when one told him of a saying of
Scipio Africane the younger / orels of Pomponius Atticus / and I wene hit were
the saying of them both / that they never made agreement with their mothers /
nor I with my wife said he / which is a greatter thing. When other / that
hard this saying / wondered upon it / and the co^corde of Viues and Blanch was
taken up and used in a manner for a proverb / he was wont to answer like as
Scipio was / which said he never made a greme^t with his mother because he never
made debate with her. But it is not to be much talked i^ a book made for an
other purpose / of my most holy mother: whom I doubt not now to have in
heaven ye fruit and reward of her holy and pure living. Moreover / because I
have purposed to make a several book of her actis and her life. And many women
that love indiscretelye break concord at ones. Therefore must their
discressyon be helped forth with some teaching / and their fersenes abated.
And that with this one thing / if they stay their mind and fantasyes / which
sone caryeth the febyll reason of women away with them. Therefore a woman should
have great demurenes and sobernes in her mind / and show hit with her deeds.
And often I warn her / that she do nothing for to seem and for a countenance:
For that is a thing of small value or none. But as she would seem to be such /
let her be in deed: and than shall she ye more truly appear. Let her wene
never to disceyue any body by clokynge and dissymulation. For men be not such
stocks nor stoones / that they can not know a counterfeted thing from a
thing in deed. And though they disceyue folks that look upon them / yet can
they not disceyue nature / which has not given like virtue unto things
counter feted as true in deed. Let them make proffe in them self. Let them
consider / whether they thy^ke them honest and sad yt make cou^tena^ce of
honesty / having none at all or not: and whether they love again such as make
semblau^ce as though they loved them and do not in deed. Hit were good for a
wife to use that counsel / that Horace the wise poet gives unto Lollius /
how to use his friend / vyddyng him apply him self unto his friends
appetyte. If he list hunte says he / do thou not sit to make versys / but
cast up thy muses / and follow the herses caryeng the nets / and lead forth
dogs. Amphion and zetus were brethren and twynnes borne of Anthiopia / the
one was very cou^nyng in harpyng / the other rude and unlearned. Now when the
sound of the harp pleased not zetus / and like to depart company betwixt
the two brethren / Amphion therefore laid down his harp: and so let the wife
order ber self after her husbands manners / and pleasure / lest he hate and
set naught by her. We read in histories / that Andromacha Hectors wife gave
hay and ootes unto his horses with her own hands / because she saw what
delight her husband had in them / and kept them for war / as dilygently as
could be. And Cecilius Plinius shows in many pistelles that he loved his
wife most derely / in which pistolles there is one written unto Hispula his
wives awnt / which had brought her up / where he gives her great thanks /
that she so taught her and brought up / when she was a child: and also showed
the cause why he loved his wife so well / writing of his wife in this wise:
She loves me / which is a sign of chastity. And more over she is greatly
given unto lernyng which fantasy she has taken by ye love she has unto me.
She has my books / and redeth / and lerneth them without book: and wha^so ever
I shall plead / she is wonders careful: and when I have done merueylous
joyful. She settes folks to watch / how I am lyked of the people / what
countenance / what noise I cause them to make / what judgment I get in the
end. And when so ever I rehearse a lectoure / she gets her next unto me /
separate from the other herers with a veil / and herkeneth most diligently
for my praises. She syngeth my verses / and plays them on the lute. None
other master teaches her / but the love she has unto me / which is the best
schole master of all. This writes Plinius. A late wha^ I was at Paris and
talked with Guilielmus Budeus at his own house / and his wife come bye / where
as we walked / a goodly person and a fair / as a man should look upon /
which as I could deem by her comely manner and countenance / me thought should
be both a prudent and virtuous huswyfe. So she after she had salued her
husband / with such reverence as a good woman should / and had welcomed me
curtesly and honorably / I asked him if she were his wife / yes forsooth says
he / this is my wife / which so diligently follows my pleasure / that she
entreats my books no worse than her own children / because she sees me love
study so well. In which thing me think her worthy more preyse than was
Plinius wife: in as much as she was learned her self / and this is not. Now
how much more honestly does she / than such as draw their husbands from
study / and counsel them to luker / play / or other pleasures / that they
may obtain part them self / either of luker / play / or volupties / because
they can get no part of their study. And the foles know not how much more
sure and veraye pleasure hit were / to have a wise man than a rich or
voluptuous. Moreover they should live a great deal more quietlye with wife men
than with ignorant foles / that never had set the brydell of reason to rule
their fantasyes withal / which be for the more part carried quite away with
such motions as comme in their minds. Nor she should loath in her husband
neither study nor any thing else / either by words / countenance / or gesture /
or any manner of signs: she shall love all thing in him / have all thing in
reverence / and set great store by it / what so ever he does / assent all
thing unto him / and believe what so ener he says / though he told that
neither were true / nor like to be / nor presume above her husband in any
manner thing she shall reken him her father / her lord / her elder / her
better. This shall she both knowledge in deed / and make semblaunce of. For how
can any love or friendship stand / if thou being rich despise him pour: or
fair thy self / loath him being foul: or thy self of great blood / disdain
him as of low birth? Iuuenall says / there is nothing more intolerable
than a rich wife. Saint Hieronyme says the same / writing against Iouyntane.
And Theophrast says / it is a turment to suffer a rich wife: but I can not
believe that / except they say / if she be ill and lewd with all. For what a
lewdenes is hit / not to consider how vain a thing that money is? for hit is
the vylest of all thing that men be proud of. But many light and frail
minds will rise a lofte with a little wind. Ah fool / does not wedlock
make all thing commen? For if that frendshipe make all thing commen / how
much more does marriage make commen not only their money / but also friends /
kynsfolke and all things else? Wherefore the Rhomayns as Plutarche says /
commanded in their laws / that the husband and wife should give nothing one
unto a another / because that neither should reken any thing pryuatly their
own. In a good commen well Plato says / that these words / mine and thine /
should be put away. Than much more in a good house hold / which is than the
best and most perfet / thereto most welthfull / when there is as one body
under one heed. For if it have many heddes or many bodies / hit is like a
monster. Moreover all the husbands and after the similitude of Plutarch /
though there be more water tha^ wine in ye cup / yet is all the myxture
called wine / so though the woman bring never so much with her / and the man
never so little / yet all is his. For he must needs have all that the woman
has / that has her self and is her lord. And you may here our lord say to
the: Woman thou shalt be in the rule of thy husband: and he shall have the
maistre on the. Nor he is to be despised for his favor. For thou haste favor
/ and he has ye / with thy favor. I will not dispute / how sklender a thing
beautte is / which stands but only in men's opynyons. For she that is
fair in one man's sight / is foul in another. How frail / and unto how
many ieoperdies endangered / how fletynge / and how unstable a thing is
beauty / wha^ one agewe / one wart / or one hear may of the most goodly
make the most loathsome? And in men no body desires such grace of fayrnes:
but they think in a woman very comely: and yet shalt thou read in the wise
kings saying: favor is a disceitfull thing / and beauty is vain: But the
woman that dredeth god / she shall be preysed. Finally / seeing that ye be one
flesh / or rather one person both thou and thy husband / than can he never
be foul that has a fair wife. And if thou will not suppose neither the wife
nor the husband to be fair / virtue alone is both beauty and noblenes. I
will let pass here / how folisshe a thing hit is / that they call noblenes.
Whose opinion and estimation stands in the comen voice of people / which is
master of all errors. But be thou never so noble / if thou marye to one
unnoble / thou art made vnnobler than he: nor the wife can not be more noble
than her husband. For that thing can not be allowed in no kind of beastis.
The children have the name of the father through all the world / as of the
better: and than if thou be very noble / either must he be made very noble /
or thou unnoble. And in the Civil law the women have their dignite of their
husbands / and not of their fathers / in so much that those that were commyn
of most noble father / if they married unto one of low degree / they were not
called noble. And that appeared well in ye noble women of Rome / which drove
out of the chapel of chastity / that was ordained for noble women / one
Virginia / commen of noble pare^tes / because she was married unto a man of low
birth: and therefore they said she was none of them / but of the comen rate of
people: neither she denied that / nor was ashamed to be taken for one of the
low people / nor despised the commen people in comparison of the noblys / nor
abashed to be called Virginia Volu^nius wife. Also Cornelia / daughter unto
Scipio / when she was married unto an house / which was in deed great and
famous / and honorable: How be it / nothing able to be compared with her
fathers / being her self of the best blood in Rome / and one the most chief
of that blood / daughter of Scipio: which was the conqueror of Affrike / the
prince of the Senate / and all the people of Rome / and also of all the world
most excellent / though she had to her mother Emylia / comen of the blood of
the Emylians / the most honorable and famous / both in Rome / and all the
world: yet she having so great honor both of fathers side and of mothers /
had leauer ever be called Cornelia Gracchi / by her husbands name / tha^
Cornelia Scipionis. Wherefore some were discontent / which for honor used to
call her Cornelia Scipionis / by her fathers name. Thesia / sister unto the
elder Dionisius the tyrant of Syracuse / was married to one Philoxenus / which
wha^ he had gone about to do a displeasure unto Dionisius / and when he was
spyed was constrained to fie out of Sycille / this Thesia his wife was sent for
by the king her brother / and rebuked of him / because she did not discover
her husbands flyghte unto him. Why said she / wenest thou that I were so
vile and abiecte / that if I had known of his going / I would not a gone
with all and followed him / and been rather the wife of Philoxenus the out law
in any place in the world / than king Dionisius sister here at home in my
country: And all the Siracusyans had in great reverence this gaye and
virtuous mind of hers. And wha^ the tyra^s were banyshed / they both
worshipped her in her life / and honored after her death. Mary the wife of
Maximilian the emperor / which had by her father of inheritance all Flanders
and Pycatdye / and the people set naught by the simple and soft disposition of
Maximilian / and sewed for all their matters unto Mary his wife / yet would she
never determyne nothy^g without her husbands advise / whose will she rekened
ever for a law / though she might well enough have ruled and ordened all as
she list / with his good will: which used to suffer of his mylde stomach any
thing yt she list / unto his good and prudent wife / and that in her own
goods. So Mary by obeynge her husband / and regardyng him so well / brought
him in to great auctorite / and made the people more obedient unto them both /
as though their powers were increased and aided either by other. And these
duties be in the mind. Now must we brydell the tongue / which if the mind
be well brydeled it shall rule it well enough. For the cause why many women be
catle of tongue is because they can not rule their my^des. For ire occupies
them holle / and plucketh out of scaam / nor suffers any pte of them to rule
it self: and therefore have they neither measure nor reason in their chydyng
and scolding. For they be put beside all reason and discretion / when the fire
has catched all to gether and made his own: which soon increases in soft
timber and apt for fire: Whereof comes ragyng / both of stomach and tongue
without measure. Which I have often wo^dred on and that in very good and honest
women / in whom saving this one vice / there lacks neither chastity nor
goodness manyfolde and great virtues. Yet have I myssed in them moderation and
temperaunce of ire and language: in so much that I have been ashamed of it /
though none of it has pertayned to me / but been among those that have been
very strangers to me / at least if one Christen body ought to be a stranger
unto an other. Therefore as it is a hard virtue for a woman to temper her
tongue / so verily hit is the most goodly virtue that can be long to any.
Which thing she shall easly do / if she abide in her own power / nor suffer
her self to be carried away with her own fa^tasies / as it were with storms
of wether. And this let her often call to mind specially / and purpose while
she is safe and in her own power / that if she chance to fall at words with
her husband / she rebuke not nor dispreyse either his kynne / or person / or
co^ditio^s / or his life / which thing she woteth should grieve his stomach.
For if he be angered / with such a thing / he will both be worse to reconsyle
/ and after that he is agreed again / yet as often as that word comes unto
his remembrance / he will never look merrily on her / beside the displeasure
that it is to god. For our lord says in the gospel of Mattheu: who so says
unto his brother Racha / that is to say / braynles / shall be accusable unto the
counsel: and he that says fool / shall be dampnable unto the pyt of fire.
Now than consider what thou shalt have / that make yt great raylyng / not
only on thy brother / but also thy father / and as much as lies in the / on
the deputy of god and all thy kyn. And if thy husband lay any such thing
unto thy charge / be wise / that it abide not in thy remembrance / but suffer
it patiently: and when he is commen unto him self again / thou shalt obtain
great thank of him for thy sufferaunce / and shalt turn his furious mind
unto good: and shalt have him the more gentle afterward and easyer to deal
with. Terence / whose purpose was none other / but to express the conditions
of the world in his comedies / writes of a chaste and honest young woman in
this wife: She as becomes an honest woman / shamfast / sad / and demure /
suffered all the iniures and fautes of her husband / and kept close the
displesures. And for these causes / ye husbands my^de turned again unto his
wife / from whose love he abhorred. And that was the counsel of the wife
nurce in Seneke the poet / which she gave unto Octauia the wife of Nero /
saying: Vanquishe thy cruel husband rather with obedience. Nor let not a
woman cast in her husbands tethe any benyfyte done unto him by her / which is
an vnsyttyng and a displeasant thing / yea among those that be nothing a
kynne to gether: and he that casts his benifyte in an other man's tethe /
loses his thanks that he should have had. For he has stryken hit out of the
others haste. Moreover if thou consider well / there can be no benifyte done by
ye to thy^ husband / to whom thou art bou^de^ as much / as unto thy father
or thy self other. Nor any good woman will make much rehersall of her kynred
or gooddis / which thing will lightly weary her husband being never so
loving. The poet Iuuenal says / that he had leauer have a pour woman and of
low birth / than Cornelia the daughter of Scipio Affrican / (of whose virtues
we have spoken here before) if she be proud and stately of her fathers
noblenes: For he says in this wise:

I had leauer have a pour Venusyne
Than the Cornelia mother unto Gracchis
If thou bring with thy virtues fine
Proud lokes / and reken up triumphis.
Away with Anniball I pray the / in arms
Over commen / and Syphax vanquished /
And with holle Carthage all to gether flyte.
The sage man Plutarche commands / that in the beginning of marriage all
occasions of debate should be eschewed / when the love is yet not well knitte to
gether / and is yet tender and weak / and easy to break with any little
cause / as a vessel new made will a sonder with a small knock. Nor let her
not chide a bed. For where should they lay away their displeasure / if they
make ye place troublesome / and comberous with scoldyng / which is most mete
for love and concord / and as hit were / corrupts the medicine / that the
disease of the mind should be helped with?

How she should live between her husband and her self privately. The.vj.
Chaptre.
HIt were not unmeet for this place to rehearse how she ought to behave her in
priuite and secretly unto her husband / between him and her. First let her
understand / that they yt were wont to make sacrifice unto Juno / whom they
called the ruler and over fear of wedlock / never offered the gall in sacrifyce
that they made / but took it out of the beast / and cast it away behind the
alter / signifieng that there ought to be neither displeasure / nor any
bytternes among married couples. Also they were wont to couple Venus and
Mercury to gether in marriage / as a pleasure and mirth. For the wife should
couple and bind her husband unto her every day more and more / with her
gentle and pleasant conditions. For nothing does more draw and entyse unto
hit / than does pleasant conditions and sweet speech. A wise woman should have
in mind merry tales / and histories (how be it yet honest) wherewith she may
refreshe her husband / and make him merry / when he is weary. And also she shall
learn precepts of wisdom to exhort him unto virtue / or draw him from vice
with all / and some sage se^tences against the assautes and rages of both
fortunes / both to pluck down her husbands stomach / if he be proud of
prosperity and wealth: and comfort and heart him / if he be stryken in heaviness
with aduersite. So Placidia daughter unto Theodosius themperoure / when her
husband Athaulpus ye king of the Gothia^s / was in purpose to utterly distroy
Rome / and the name of Romans / with her sweet eloquence and pleasant behauour
/ brought him out of that ungracious purpose / and saved her country. And
again the wife shall make her husband a counsel of all her sorrows and
cares: so that they be mete to tell a wise man of. She shall take only for her
companyon / and talkyng fellow / cou^sellour / master / and lord / and utter
unto him all her thoughts / and rest in him. For these things make love and
co^corde. For lightly we love them / whom we tell our counsel unto / and as
it were unlade us of our thoughts / and in whom we trust much. And lightly
folks love them again / of whom they reken themself loved and trusted. A
wise woman shall as much as she may / search diligently whether her husband
have any ill susspectio^ there / wheder there be any sparks of a^ger / or hate /
or any resydues or steps of them left in his mind / if there be any such
thing / let her labor to get it out or hit grow greatter. For these things
increase lyghtlye with a little cause. Let her therefore get this out of her
husbands mind by gentle means / and content him again. For unknowing
sickness increase and distroye ye body sooner / than those that appear. Let her
not strive to pluck it out / nor handle it hard / lest she fasten it the more
sure in / wha^ she may better avoid it without any pain / that is to say /
without complaynt / and without gronyng. Nor let her not thy^ke that either god
or man is content with her / while her husband is displeased with her. Our
lord says in the gospel: If thou come to do thine offrynge at the alter /
and there remember that any displeasure be yet remayny^g between thy brother
and the / lay down thine offryng there / and go be agreed first with thy
brother / and after offer that unto god / that thou intendest. For thou call
for peace of god in vain / as long as thy friend is not pleased with the /
but much more / if thy husband be not. What so ever is spoken in the chamber
and the holy bed of wedlock / let her take good head to keep more secreate and
counsel / than the sacrifice of Ceres in Elewce was kept / or mysteries of
any other god or gods. For what madness is hit to babble out such things / as
ought to be kept so secret. The wise people of Athens / when they had war
with Phylyp king of Macedony / and had taken letters of his / sent unto his
wife Olempias / they would not suffer them to be opened and red / because they
rekened the secrets of wedlock to be / as they be in deed / holy / and to be
kept in priuite / nor to be conuenyent to commyne them abroad / or to be
known of other folks / than of the wife and her husband. And therefore they
sent the letters untouched unto Macedone unto ye queen. Wherefore they were
worthy to have their wives both to keep faith and counsel with them. Now if
they did that unto their enemy armed against them / how much more is it for
the to do it unto thy husband? Porcia wife unto Brutus proved her own
patience with a wound / whether she could keep counsel of great matters or
not. And wha^ she saw she could hyde the wound and keep secret / tha^ was
she so bold as to ask of her husband what he studied so carefully upon: And
when he had told her how they purposed to flee Caesar / she kept her as well
as any that was of the same counsel. Neither the wife ought only to love her
husband her self / but also to se that she make not other folks to hate him
/ or bry^g him i^ to any ieperdy by causyng him to be e^uyed through her
means. Nor let not her use her husband to be her page / and revenge all
iniures done unto her / except hit be the parell of chastity / which is the
most precious thing that a woman can have. If any body have spoken words of
displeasure or dishonesty unto her / or done a thy^g that may seem to grieve her
tender mind / let her not run straight to her husband and kendel his
stomach with fyrye words / such as anger is wont to cause. A good woman
shall take all such things patiently / and shall reken her self safe and
sure enough / as long as her chastity is holle and untouched: which if it be
poluted / there is nothing to be rekened pure. She shall use in chamber not
only chaste behauour / but also shamfastnes. And let her remember that she is a
wife / in whom Plutarche would have both great love and great demurenes coupled
and joined to gether. They say that the queen's of Perse were wo^te to keep
private and sober feastis with their husbands / but as for in wa^ton ba^kettes
came none but syngers / mynstrelles / and concubynes / wedlock was had in such
reverence. For as the noble prince was wont to say / a wife was a name of
dignite and not of bodily lust: so the husband is a name of couplyng and
affinite / as I have declared. Nor the husbands ought not to give them self
unto over much pleasure / nor to delight in any company but their wives / but
our purpose is not here to teach the husbands. How be it / it is not
convenient for them to be masters of wanto^nes and lechery unto their wives.
And let them ever remember this saying of Xystus the philosopher: He is an
adulterar with his wife / who so is over excedyng and over hot a lover. And
let him obey the apostle Paul / saying unto husbands / that they should have
their wife as vessels of generation in holiness / and not in unlawful
concupiscence or immoderate / as the paga^s do / that know not god. The spouse
in the canticles calls his spouse sister / to thentent to make his love more
measurable: but we will return again unto women. Let them not defoyle the
holy and honest bed of wedlock with fylthy and lecherous actis. The chaste
wife of Spartane / wha^ she was asked if she used to go unto her husband / nay
perde said she / but he unto me. For the chaste woman never provoked the lust
of her husband / nor used the bodylye pleasure / but for her husbands
pleasure. Trebellius Pollio wrytethe / that zenobia the queen of Palmyra / a
very well learned and a wise woman / was of so great chastity / that she would
not lie with her husband / without she had proved before / whether she were
with child or no. For when she had lain with him she would tarry her time / to
se whether she had conceived: and if she had not / than was she content to
suffer her husbands will again. Who would think / that this woman had any
lust or pleasure in her body? This was a woman worthy to be had in honor and
reverence / which had no more pleasure in her natural parts / tha^ in her
foot or her fy^ger. She had been worthy to have borne children with outen
man's company / which never desired it / but only for children: or else to
have brought them forth without pain / which gate them without pleasure. But
one of our christen women called Ethelffryda / a queen of England / did a
greatt act / which after she had borne one child / never lay more with her
husband. And yet one Edelthrudis / a queen of the same country / passed her:
which had had.ij. husbands / and made them both to keep perpetual chastity.
There were also other couples / that lived to gether without carnal dealyng /
as Henricus Bauarus / the prince of Rome / and Sinegunda his wife: Iulianus the
martyr / and Basilia his wife: and in the cite of Alexander Chrysa^thus / and
Daria his wife: and Amos with his wife. For these holy folks understood well
enough / that thing which is written of wise men / that the bodily pleasure is
unworthy this excellent nature of ours / which we have of the soul. And
therefore every body dispiseth it the more / and casts it away / the more
that he has of that excellentnes of the soul / and the nigher that he is to
god: and other heavenly minds neither will use this pleasure often / except it
be such as have but beastly / vile / and abiecte minds / and has taken much
of vile nature / and very little of that high and celestyall nature. You wives
/ when you put of your smokkes / put upon chamefastnes / and keep always both
day and night both in company of other men and of your husbands / both in the
light and in the dark / that most honest veil of nature. Let never god /
let never angels / let never your own conscience espy you bare of the cover
of shamfastnes. For there is nothing more foul and loathsome than you be / if
you be naked of that Cover. The wise and sad poet Hesiodus would not have women
to put of their smokkes in the night / because the nyghtes be the immortal
gods.

Of Ieolosy. The.vii. Chaptre.
CIcero calls ieolosy / after thopinion of the stowicke philosophers / a care
of a man's mind / lest an other should have as well as he / that thing /
which himself would obtain. Hit is called also a fear / lest an other man
should have that commen with him that thing / which he would have to be
seuerallye his own. What words so ever they expound hit with / verily hit is
a sore vexation and agony / and a veraye cruel tyranne / which as long as it
rayneth and raygeth in the husbands heart / let the wife never hope to have
pease. Hit were better for them both to be dead / than any of them to fall in
to ieolosye / but specially the man. What pains or turment can be comparedde:
both for him that is vexed with the inquietnes of ieolosye / and him / of whom
the fear is? Thereof ryseth gronyng / complaining / cryenge / with hate both
of him self and other / and perpetual suspection of harm / and chidyng /
braulyng / fyghtyng / yea and also murder. For we have both red and hard tell
of many / that have slain their wives / moved only with ieolosy: the which
affection does also rage wild beastis. For Aristotle writes / that the lion
will all to tear ye lyones / if he take her in aduoutry. And I my self / with
many other moo / have seen the Cock swanne kill his hen / because she
followed an other cock. Therefore let the woman labor with all her power /
lest this fantasies come upon her husband / or if it come upon him / to get
him out of it / and cause him to leave it. And that shall she do only by one
means / that is / if she neither say nor do / that her husband may take
suspecion of. Saint Paul / saint Hieronyme / Aristotle / and many other great
and wise men counsel very well / that folks neither do ill / nor any thing
that longs to ill. Parauenture thou will say / that this is an hard
thing. For who can rule other men's suspeciousnes. Yes / many ways. First
if thou live chastely / and that is the redyest way. For time ever brings
forth the truth / and time causes the false hode to fade and vanysshe away
/ and confermeth and strentheth the troth. If thou be good / and have a
ieolious husband / yet may thou hope that he will put away that unquietness
of mind. But and thou be naught / be sure that that fantasy shall never go
from him / but rather increase daily. Finally / if thou suffer thy husbands
ieolosy gyltles / thou art happy / if gylty / thou art unhappy. Therefore
shall thou both love thyn husband / and labor that he may perceive him self
loved: but beware that thou use no faynynge nor dissymulation: For than the
more craftily that he sees the dissemble / the more sore will he hate the. For
faynynge never lyghtlye comes to the point that it is purposed: but for the
more part clean contrary. I give women often warnyng / and often in deed they
need warnyng / and much more the men / that they disceyue not them self /
supposing to be no force / whether one do a thing in deed or some to do it.
For they be but foles and ignorante / that wene they shall alter the nature of
things with colorynge and faynynge. Let her show her self not only to love
no man so well as her husband / but also to love none other at all but him. If
she love any other / let it be but for her husbands sake: or if she can not
love her husbands fre^des / yet let her not hate them. For there be many men
that can be well content / and there to very glad / to have all other things
/ in common with their wives / except friends. And in the same mind be wives
to / as concerning their maids / and other women / that they love. When she is
forth a broad / let her use great demurenes / neither love gladly to keep
company / or common with other women's husbands / neither with women that have
a noughtye name / neither abide the sight of any baude: as for letters / let
her neither give nor receive / her husband unknowing. Let her speak but little
of other women's husbands / neither praise their fayrnes / or any good
property of their person / neither gladly give an ear unto any that prayseth
them / nor look much upon them / neither do any thy^g before them / that should
be occasion to any body to suspecte ill. These must I needs say / because that
I would she should not only eschew harm / but also every thing that bears
the color of harm. Now will I speak of the woman's ieolosye / which if she
have any / I will not greatly go about much remedy / to get it away / so hit
be not to much and to violent / and trouble peace of all ye house / and vex
her husband. For if it were such / than hit were good for to seek remedy.
First and foremost let the woman consider / that her husband is her lord /
nor that she may do by right all that he may. For the man is not so much
bound as the woman to keep chastity / at least ways by the laws of the
world / for by god is law both be bound in like. Let her considre that the
man lives more at liberty than the woman / and has more to care fore. For
she has nothing to se to but her honestye. Let her stop her ears unto
such as tell her ill of her husband / and think they do hit but to pyke a
thank. Hermyone / wife unto Cadmus the king of Thebis / when she had gone from
her husband moved by ieolosy / she complayneth and soroweth in the tragedy of
Euripides the poet / saying that much resort of women unto her had undone her
/ because she had given lystenynge and credence unto those sklanderars.
Therefore if a woman purpose to forsake her husband for his concubynes / or else
for to braule sore with him / let her call unto remembrance the words / that a
certain man spoke ones / wha^ he chased a fugityue servant that he had / and
he ran in to the back house: I am glad said he / to se the there as I would
have put the / and I had catched the: so let the wife think / that she could
do nothing that should more please her husbands concubyne / than if she run
from her house and her husband / or else be at debate with him. For than she
will think to have his favor the more / when she sees his wife cast hit of
with her frowardnes / beside ye speech of people / which thy^g is worse for a
woman / than to suffer any kind of pain with her husband. We read in stories
that young and new married women / when their husbands many times for the love
of hunting has layne out al night / they have suspected them with other women
/ and folowedde them in to the woddes and forestis / and there in the dark
have been killed with arrows and torn with dogs / in the stead of wild
beastis / and suffered great pain for their curious ieolosy. But how much
more curtesly and wisely did Tertia Emylia wife unto Affricane the first /
which when she saw that her husband had a fantasye unto one of her maids /
dissembled the matter / lest she should seem to condemn of incontine^cy the
vanquissher of the world / and the prince of her country / and also her self
of impacience / that could not suffer a wrong of her husband / which was the
nobliste man of the world in his time. But because no man should think / that
she kept any grutche in her heart / she married that same woman / that had been
her husbands concubyne / unto an honest man of her own servants / supposyng
that if folks departed out of this life / have any remembrance or feeling of
worldly matters / that deed should be a great pleasure unto her husbands
soul. This wise woman knew well enough that she was the wife and the lady of
the house / whether so ever her husband went. And if she should bear any
grutche that her husband should lie with other women that were but a fantasye
of bodily pleasure / and not of love. Moreover / if the wife should take
displeasure with her husband / she should but provoke him the more: and if she
suffer him / she shall the sooner reclame him / and specially wha^ he does
perceive and compare to gether her gentle manners and his concubynes
unreasonable pride: for so Terence a peynter and declarer of the world is
conditions writes in the comedye called Hecyra / that Panphilus was gotten
from Bacchis his concubyne / whom he loved so well / and brought a way his
mind unto his wife / after that he had ones considered and known well him
self / and Bacchis / and his wife / that was at home / estemynge both their
manners as they were in deed / how his wife was as an honest woman / ought to
be / sober / demure / and shamfast: and how she suffered all the harms and
wrongs that her husband did unto her / and kept her displeasure in close:
than his mind by lyttel and little over comen partly with pite / that he had
on his wife / partlye with wro^ges done by Bacchis / fell clean out from
Bacchis and turned all his love unto his wife / seeing she was of conditions
according to his appetite. Thus says Terence. Neither I will let pass the
deeds of that noble woman / which wha^ her husband was taken with love of an
other man's wife / and she saw him go daily unto her with ieoperdye of his
life / because of the woman's husband and her brethren / that lay still in
watch for him / said unto her husband in this manner: Sir I se you can not be
gotten away from ye love of that woman / neither I will require that of you / I
desire you only / that you love not with so great ieoperdye of your life: she
says she will be content to goo with you. Therefore bring her home unto pour
own castle / and I shall leave her all this the most goodlyest part of the
place / and go my self in to an other / and I promise you of my faith to
entreat her none other wise / tha^ mine own sister: if you find contrary /
drive me out of the house / and let her abide. So in conclusyon she persuaded
her husband: and upon a night he brought his concubyne in to his castle / sore
tremblyng and fearyng her lovers wife. But she received her most gentelly and
courteslye / and brought her in to her chamber / nor never called her but
sister / and sent unto ger twys aday / and commanded she should be entreated
more te^derly and dayntely tha^ her own self / without any token of hate /
either in word or deed. Than said she unto her husband: Now may you use
your love with less care and ieoperdye. So / the man of an holle year came not
at his wife / which was both fayrer and more noble of birth / and honest /
and in all points more goodly than his concubyne. What she thought in her
mind / only god knows: but as far as men could perceive / she took no
displeasure with ye matter at all / specially after she had rydde her
husband out of ieoperdye. Much was she in the church / and much in prayer /
and every man knew well enough her trouble / but no man knew that ever she
grutched or co^playned. With in a year / this man turned his mind holly unto
his wife / and began to hate his concubyne deadly / and at the last put her
away and set all his love upon his wife / in so much / that ever after he said
/ that al his mind / his life / and his heart was in her / and now he says
he will not live long after / if it should chance her to dye. I will not name
them / because they be both on live. These examples have I brought of them that
have an evident cause of ieolosy. For as for them that be not sure of any cause
/ and be unreasonable / and intolerable / and cause great vexacion / both unto
their self and unto their husbands / for an offense / that they wotte not
whether it be so or not / as many do / which either love inordinatly / or
follow their own fantasyes over much / they take light suspeciousnes and
feeble conjectures / for great and evident arguments. If her husband bourde
with a another woman / let not the wife straight suspecte / that he loves
her. A great part of this affection comes of believe / and ryseth ofter of
opinion and suspection tha^ matter in deed. Therefore let not the woman be taken
with every light suspection / which ought not to be moved or agreued though
she knew any thy^g in deed.

Of raymentes. The.viii. Chap.
ALso arayment in like wise as all other things ought to be referred unto the
husbands will / if he like simple arayment / let her be content to wear it.
For if she desire more goodly and costly / than it appears that she trymmeth
not her self so much for her husbands eyes as other men's: which is no
point of an honest woman. What should a woman do with gold or silver / that is
a Christen woman / and also whose husband delyteth not there in? Thou woman /
will thou not apply thy self unto Christis arayment at thy husbands
byddynges? which ought / if he would have it so / to wear the deuylles
habyte. Saint Ambrose speaks of payntynge in this manner. Here of says he /
comes those inflamynges of vices / to paynte their faces with colors / lest
men should myslyke them and with the adultery of their face they go about
adultery of their body. What a madness is hit to change the natural Image /
and take a picture / and whiles they fear their husbands judgment to utter
their own? For she gives first judgment of her self / that would be other
wise tha^ she was borne: and so while she gothe about to be lyked of other /
first of all she dislyketh her self. Saint Ambrose in these words shows
what his mind is / if the husband have not specially commanded his wife to
do so. Neither any wise man will command it. But if he do command / or if
she know that hit be his will / than for his mind and pleasure let her do
this. But than shall she say as saint Hester said / when she was apparelled
and tired with all ye deuylles pomp. Thou knoweste good lord (said she) my
necessite / and that I abhore this fygne of pride and of mine honor upon my
head on the days of my pomp / and I course hit as a cloute defiled with blood
/ neither use to wear hit on such days as I may be at rest. Therefore if a
woman be at her liberty to wear what apparel she list / let her remember
that there is no cause greatly desired wherefore she ought to desire to be
proudely and goodly apparelled / seeing she is married and has catched all ready
that / which other says they / hunte for with such nets. Saint Eypryan
the martyr byddeth married women take heed / that they do not flater and excuse
their own fantasyes / and lykynges in themself with their husbands / lest
when they lay their husbands for their excuse / they take them for fellows
and accessaries of their vice. I have showed mine opinion before already / as
concerning apparel: now hit is best to give an ear unto saint Peter and
Paul / which bad a christian wife wear simple arayme^t / and be more goodly
in holiness of living / than gold or precious stones. And indede an honest
woman has other more goodly atyreme^tes / which as the wise man Xistus says
/ stands in chaste demeanoure and honest bryngyng up of her children / as
Cornelia Gracchus wife was wont to say: and also in her husbands honor / or
worship. The wife of Philo the wife man / when she went forth upon a time
without a golden garla^de on her head / and other noble women did wear / one
asked her why she had none: she a^swered again / the husbands honor and
virtue is ornament enough unto the wife. Who did not more regard the wife of
Cato / which was no very rich man / than all the wives of a great meany of
Publica^nes / which flowed in goods* Also hit was more honor for Xantippe to
be wife unto pour Socrates / than either unto Scopa / or any other rich man
in those days. Democrates says / that the ornament of a woman is small
apparel and little spech / and she is the most honorable that has the best
husband: not withstandyng / as I would have a myfe to use no precious apparel
likewise no more do I allow fylthy and slobery arayment. Also some thing must
be done for the time / place / and common custom / but not excedyng / but
rather much less than they receive. Aristotle in his books of house kepy^g
would have a woman to use less rayme^t and apparel tha^ ye laws and customs
of ye cite do apoynt. For she ought to consider (says he that neither goodly
clothyng / nor excellent beauty / nor abundance of gold / shall cause a woman
so great worship / as shall sobernes in all thing / and study to live chaste
and honestly. Therefore ought she rather to regard reason / virtue / and
holiness / than vain iugementes and erroneous customs / which have been
brought up by some ungracious folks / and accepted and confermed by the
corrupt and folishe fantasyes of the common people. Wherefore some good and
virtuous wives ought with one asset to resist and go against such customs /
and by sklender and simple aparell do them self that is couenient / and show
example unto other what way they ought to take: and hit should be a greatt
preyse for them to put away an ill custom / than follow it. Nor there is no
despair / but some may bry^ge down yt again / which was brought up by some.
For the co^cent and agreement of good women should prevail as much in goodness
/ as the concent of ill women has preualed in noughtynes if they would ones
begin to strive to gether / who should pass other in honesty / measure and
chastity / and reken it a worship to get the victory in these things / and not
in the bostyng of riches: which thing does sone induce light minds in to
great envy / and strife / but few does envy that a^ other should be more
virtuous tha^ she / or more pacient / or low her husband better / but many do
envy / if another should have more apparel / chains / broches / ouches / or
rings / than she. O proud and folysshe beastis / even created unto vanite and
pomp / here upon ryseth strife and proceeds for the with such fervent minds
/ as Cato says very wisely in the story of Liuius / that the rich women would
have that / which none other should be able to come by. And on the other side
/ the pour women / lest they should be despised and naught set by / by yt
means they streyne them self above their power. And so when they be ashamed
of that / that they should not / and nothing ashamed of that / they should be /
they rob both their husbands and their children / to clothe them self with
/ and leave hungre and pouerte at home / that they may go forth them self
lade^ with sylke and gold. Wherefore they compel their husbands unto shamfull
crafts to get by / and myscheuous deeds / with their whynyng and gronyng /
lest their kynse women / alyance / or their neighbor should seem rycher or
more gloriously apparelled than they. And yet al these outrageous and
intolerable things moughte be suffered / if they did not sell away their
chastity to get there by that their husbands either will not give them / orels
for lack can not give. Some remedy should be found for these euilles /
either by the concente and agreement of rychemennes wynes / which with their
example should revoke other again unto better mind orels some law would be
made / such as yt law was in Rome called Oppius law / to ^ry^^^e and measure
women's costelynes. These Christen preachers / should follow the example of the
pagane Pythagoras / or rather pass him in such a goodly strife / of whom the
cronicler Iusty ne writes in this manner: Pythagoras taught women chastity and
obedyence unto their husbands / and often did tell them / that the mother of
virtues was sobre diet and hard fare: and he brought to pass with continual
disputyng and preaching unto them / that the wives laid away golden and
garnisshed clothes / and other ornaments of their state / and refused them as
instruments of ryote and superfluyte. For he affyrmed that the true
garnysshyng and ornaments of wives was chastity / and not clothing.

Of walkyng abroad. The.ix. Chap.
HIt is becommyng for married women to go less abroad tha^ maids / because
they have yt which ye maids should seem to seek. Therefore let them cast
all their mind to keep well him that they have gotten / and study to please
him only: The maker of the laws of the Lacedaemonians bad that the wives /
when they went for the abroad / should cover their faces / because it was not
convenient for them / either to look on other men / or to be looked upon of
other men / seeing they have at home alredye / whom all only they ought to
look upon / and beloked upon withal. Which custom the people of Perse land
/ and all thest quarter of the world / with most part of the greeks did use.
But I would not they should wrape their head / as now adays the custom is to do
in many cou^tres of Europe / that is to go unknown / and unseen of other
folks / but them self both to se and to know other. In the which doing /
I wondre not so much of the woman's delight / delight quod he? Nay I would say
the thick shamlesnes under that thine cover / as I do their husbands
folysshenes / that do not se how great an occasyon of viciousnes it is. They
will do no harm I wis say they: well / I would they had never done. And though
they would do none / yet it is not good to open such a wyndowe of liberty.
Therefore let the women's faces be bare of clothes / but closed and covered with
shamfastnes. For that couery^g was not so much ordened to cover the woman /
that no man should se her / as it was / that she should se no man. Fauna wife
unto Faunus / king of Thaborigines / lived many years / and yet did never man
se her / but Faunus him self. Therefore after her death / she was worshipped
for a gods / and named the good gods / and her sacrifice was so kept /
that no man might laufully come to hit / neither any image of male beast be
there / while it was a doing. Nor I say not this because I would have women
contynually shette up and kept in / but because I would have them go seldom
abroad / and belytle among men / which thing they shall best content their
husbands withal. what pleasure think you hit was unto king Tygranes /
which when he had bid Cirus king of Perse unto a banquet / and after the
banquet was done / much coi^casion there was of the comely person and fayrnes
of Cirus / tha^ Tygranes asked his wife / what she thought by Cyrus? Verily
said she / I can not tell: for so god love me / all the ba^ket while / I never
looked at any man / but you. A virtuous wife will neither gladlye here other men
/ nor of them / nor dispute of any man's person. For what has she a do with
other men's fayrnes / which ought to count all in like fair and foul /
saving her husband. Let her think him fayrer than any other / more proper
than any other: like as the mother does her only child. In the Canticles of
the Bible / the spouse thinks his spouse fairest of all women: and again /
she thinks him the fairest of all me^. Like wise Duellius had a great favor
unto his wives symplicite / I will tell hit in saint Hieronymes words.
Duellius says he / which had the first tryumphe at Rome for bat / tail on
the sea / married a goodly maid called Bilia / which was so virtuous and
chaste / that she was example unto all other in that same world: when it was
not only a vice / but also a wonder to se a woman naught. So upon a time this
Duellius / wha^ he was aged and weak and tremblyng / chaunsed to fall out and
chide with another man / in which words that other man rebuked him of his
stynkyng brethe: so he went home displeased there with / and there blamed his
wife / because she never had told him / that he might a found some remedy for
hit: I would have told you said she / but that I went every man's brethe
had smelled so. This noble and chaste woman was to be praised: for both
whether she did not know the fault of her husband / or suffered it patiently /
and because her husband did sooner learn his fault and hurt of his body by his
enemies ill words tha^ his wives lothyng. The same things men say / chau^sed
unto Hiero king of Stracuse. But those women can not say so / that kiss many
men before they have husbands / and many wha^ they have husbands. what
demurenes I would have kept abroad / it may be perceived well enough / by that
which I would have kept at home in her chamber / with her husband by night.
whereto should I speak of that rude and vncumly manner / which is used in many
countres / that men and their wives shall wasshe both to gether in one bane?
This custom is not ones to be named: for hit is rather beastlye than mete for
any reasonable folks. I would have a woman to here but few words / namely
where men talk / and speak less. And if she think she shall here or se any
vnclenlye thing / co^uey her self away quickly. King Hiero / whom I spoke of
here before / conde^pned ye poet Epicharmus in a great some of money / because
he had rehearsed an uncleanly matter in the queen's presence. Augustus Caesar gave
a commandment / that no woman should come and se wrastelers / because they
were wont to wrastell naked. Nor it was no wonder that he did so. For this
Caesar was he that made ye laws of chastity and adultery. Therefore I would not
have a woman to speak / except it be a thing that should do hurt to be kept
in. Neither here / or at least wise give no head unto such matters / as ptayne
not to the^creasyng of virtue. The poet Iuuenall rebukes such women as be
wise / what the people of Seres and Thrace do. and what sturrynge is all the
world over. Also Cato in his oration / that he made of women / would an honest
wife should be ignorant / what laws be made or anulled in her country / or
what is done among men of law in the court. And here upon rose this comen
saying of the Greeks: women's works ought to be webbes of cloche / and not
eloquent orations. And Aristotle says / it is less rebuke for a man to be
busye to know what is done in his kytchyn / than for the woman what is done
without her house. Therefore he byddeth / that she shall neither speak nor here
at all of any matters of the realm. Seneke writes / that his aunt for sixtene
year to gether / while her husband was president in Egypt / was never seen
forth of her house / nor never resceyued into her house any of that country:
nor never asked any thing of her husband / nor suffered any thing to be asked
of her self. Therefore says he / that same country / which is very bablyng /
and wyly to find fault with their rulers / in the which many a man has ruled
with out fault / how be it not without an ill name / yet they gave reverence
unto her / as a special example of holiness / and kept in all their raylyng
words / which is hard for him to do / that has a pleasure in ieoperdus
conseytes. And yet unto this day they wyshe for such a another as she: though
they have no hope to get her. It had been a great thing / if ye country had
lyked her but.xvj. days / but it was a greatter thing / that they knew her
not. These be Senekes words. For yt holy and wise woman understood well enough
/ that often accompanyeng with men should hinder some of her good name: as hit
does no good to fine clothe to be handled of many. There be some women that
bear them self high of other folks honor / as of their husbands brother /
kynsma^ / and some of a friend / with whom they have very small acquantance.
What a folly is this to handle thy self so / yt a another shall be made good and
worthy honor / for his own virtue / and thou made naught and unworthy
honor / with a another bodies virtue? And many there be / that so abuse their
kynsmennes power / that they make both them self / and them that have the
power hated by the means: as the wife of the brother of Vitellius the emperor
/ which took more upon her / because of her brother in laws principalite /
tha^ themperours wife her self did. The hedy domination of ye sisters of Hiero
King of Siracuse / moved the people unto insurrection: where with both the
king and all his children were distroyed. There was also in our days a
certain noble man / that had a wondrous proud wife / and hit chaunsed him to
be turned out of all his goods and possessions at ones / whom every man
thought was well served / because the woman used her self so proud and
arrogantlye upon her husbands power. Therefore you women that will meddle with
common matters of realms and cites / and wene to govern people and nations
with the braydes of your stomachs / you go about to hurl down towns before
you and you light upon an hard rock: where upon though you brouse and shake
countres very sore / yet they escape and you perysshe. For you know neither
measure nor order: and yet which is the worst point of all / you wene you
know very well / and will be ruled in nothing after them that be expert.
But you attempt to draw all thing after your fantasye without discretion.
Wene you it was for nothing / that wise men for bad you rule and governance of
countries: and that saint Paul byddeth you shall not speak in congregatyon and
gatherynge of people? All this same means / that you shall not meddle with
matters of realms or cities / your own house is a cite great inoughe for you:
as for forth abroad / neither know you / nor be you known. Thucydides would
not that a good woman should be as much as praised with the comen voice: and
much less dispraysed. But he would she should be clearly unknown / neither
the common fame to make any me^tio^ of her. It is no great sign of honesty for
a woman to be much known / talked / and so^ge of: and to be marked by some
special name in many men's mouths: as to be called fair / or coclede yed /
skwynt / brown / halte / fat / pale or lean. For these things in a good
woman ought to be unknown abroad / as we have showed in the book before. Not
withstandyng there be some that must needs be a broad / for their living / as
those that by and sell: which / if it were possible / I would not that women
should be put to those busynesses: and if it must needs be so / let old women
do them / or married women that be paste myddle age. But if young women must
needs do this / let them be curteise without flattering words / and shamfaste
without presumsion / and rather take loss in their marchaundise / than in
their honestye. I say this because of some / which do entyse buyers to them
with excedyng flatteryng words. But Plautus says / it is no point mete for
an honest wife / but for a harlotte / to flatter other men: whose dissaytes
with in a while when men know them / they escheme as warelye as the meremaydes
song. Shamfastnes shall get a great deal more gaynes / whom the byer shall
conjecture both by the face and conditions / will neither lie nor disceyue
them. A rich marchaunte has pleasure in pleasant words and merye conceytes:
But yet few will give money for them: and when it comes to the marchaundise
in ernest / no man will believe such wanton speech. But how so ever these
matters be / let a woman ever have this in mind and remembrance / that the
only treasure of a woman is honestye with shamefastnes. Now seeing I would
have an honest wife thus ordered at home / you may easily perceive / how I do
allow / that she should go to war and handle armor / which I would not she
should ones name. And would to god all christen men would lay them away. Now
that wydowe Judith is vanisshed away / which was but a shadow and
signyfication of things to come / and with her contynence and holiness cut of
the head of Holopherne / that is to say the devil. Now Delbo^ra / that judged
Israel / gives place unto the gospel of Christ: how be it she did not help
the people of god fyghtyng / so much by counsel and feats of war / as by
fasting / prayeng / and prophecieng: of the which.ij. women saint Ambrose /
after that he had entreated in the book of wydowes / turned his speech unto
christen women / saying: The church ouercometh not their adversaries power by
secular armor / but with spiritual armor: which be strong enough before god
to distroy the fences and the heghtes of spiritual noughtynes. The armor of
the church is faith / the armor of the church is prayer / which
overcomes the adversary. A woman ought not to show for the abroad any sign
of presumption / disdain / or dayntye stomach / neither by words /
countenance / nor pace: but all shall be simple / and right for the / demure /
sobre / and tempered / and spiced with shamfastnes. And because the light
minds of some will be lightly sterred with never so little a blaste of honor /
it is necessary to give them warnyng / to be more sad and wise / than to be
mouedde with so little a wind / or to be ignorant / how folisshe and how
little worth that thing is / which we call honor. What matter makes hit /
whether thou be called Cornelia / or masters Cornelia? O tender heart / that
will be sturred with one sound of a word. Thou fool / do not thou se /
that thou art no maistres for calling so? How do they that call women
queen's and Empressis / do they make them so / because they call them? The
angel Gabriell called his queen and lady but Mary by her name / and thou
disdayneste to be called by the name of one better than thy self. what an
ignorance art thou in of that thing / which thou desyrest? For men use to
call that woman their lady or maystres / that is their paramour. For she in
deed is a man's lady and tyrante over him / unto whom he serves humbly and
subiectly. Moreover what force is it / whether thou sit or walk first or
last? In some countres / the first has the preeminence / in some countres
the last / and in some the myddel. wherefore this thing is but made by menues
opinion / and not by nature. Therefore if thou will do after opinion / and
content it / when so ever thou art the formooste / think thy self in that
country / where the formoste be preferred. when thou art in the myddle /
think thy self there where the mydle has the honor. And when thou art the
last / suppose thou art among them that most esteem the last. And so where
so ever thou art / thou shalt think thy self well regarded. And again on
the other side / lest thou should wax to haute with thine honor / when thou
art in the most honorable rowme / suppose thy self to be among that people
/ where that place is the lowest. Now as for going out of the way / for
reverence to give an other rowme / that is nothing but as the more mighty
should suffer the weaker / or the holle favor ye lame / or the lusty and well
lykyng / the weak and sick / or the empty the laden / or the smyste the sloo.
And wenest thou there is any other cause / why me^ speak so gentilly unto women
/ and set so much by them / and speak them so fair / and have them in such
reverence / but because that lusty and strong nature does handle dayntly that
other / which is weak and feeble / where in never so little an offense would
soon enter / and be deape imprinted / like as thynne and britlell glasses will
catch harm lightly? Therefore you get no honor by your own merits / but of
other folks courtesy: nor you be not honored because you deserve it / but
because you sore desire hit. For when men se you be so gredy and desirous to
have honor / and that such a small thing deliteth you so much / men be
content to do you that pleasure / and call you maystresses / and laugh upon
you / and speak gentilly to you. For words be no great cost / they give you
ye way / because it is no great let of their journey / and in the mean season
yet they rest themself. They set you the highest / for they can sit well
enough bynethe yo: they give you the better appointed part of the house / fine
clothes / gold / silver / precious stones / so do they to their children /
because they shall not weep. For they teken you no wyser than children: nor no
more you be / as long as you be moved with such childisshe things. And to be
short / they let you have such things / as they se displease you so much
/ if you lack them. And hit is an honor and a praise for the men / because
they set naught by these things: but because they know you be of such
appetite / no man rekeneth you the more honorable / because you be honored of
the men / but rather rekeneneth them curtese and gentle / which do give
honor unto them / that they know be so loathe to lack it. I am a man my
self: not withstandyng / seeing I have taken upon me to teach you / eue^ for a
fatherly zele and charity that I bear toward you / I will neither hyde nor
dissemble any thing / that I shall think does pertayne unto your instruction
and lernyng. Therefore will I open unto you even our serretes. Therefore I would
ye should understand / that we do but laugh at you and mock you / with that
vain color of honor / and the more desirous that ye be of honor / ye more
we mock you / and talk of you in dirision / and give unto you abu^dantly that
pettisshenes / which you call honor. But we give hit not for naught. For you
give again unto us no little sport and delectatio^ with the folysshenes of
your opinions and fantasyes. Truly you understand not / where in very honor
does stand. It is becomyng to deserve honor / but not to couete hit. For hit
should follow and ensue / and not be hu^ted fore. Now it shall be a sign unto
you / that you deserve honor / when you be not agreued to be unregarded. And
that same thing that we call honor / is of so froward nature and disposicio^
/ that as philosophers write / a Crocodile does so / hit follows them that
flee / and flees from them that follow hit: and is sharp to them that be
gentle to it / and gentyl unto them that be sharp unto hit. Socrates says /
there is no way more ready unto honor / than by virtue: the which alonly
seeks for none honor / and yet fyndeth it. Saluste writes / that Cato
Vticensis had leauer be good than seem good. Therefore says he / the less
that he sought for honor / ye more it pursued upon him. Therefore the most
sure way unto very honor is virtue / which neither can lack honor / nor
takes indignation though it be despised. Flatterynges / glosynges / and fair
words / what woman so ever rekeneth them honor and preyse / is worthy for her
folly to have none other honor or praise. And yet there be some so mad /
that though they know them self but flattered / yet they wene they be
praised. What you wretches / know you not how far flattery differs from
praise? Wene you that is praise / which neither the person speaks with his
heart / and you know to / that it is false that he says: and that he speaks
not as he thinks: but either to mock you / or to disceyue you with all?
Believe no man of your own goodness better than your self. And she that
sercheth and knows her self well / fyndethe nothing in her self at al /
that is worthy any praise: But a mind / which thinks it self unworthy any
praise. If there be any goodness / it comes of god: and thank him therefore /
give him lauds and thank. But if there be any evil / it comes of our own
unhappiness. Wherefore the rebuke stands unto our self / and the praise
perteyneth unto a another. Now seeing that worldly honor is of so small price /
it is a point of a vile mind / to envy worldly things unto any other body.
And if it be shame to envy for honor / it is much more shame to have envy
at other for money / clothynges / or possessions / for yet is honor better
than all they. Neither it is convenient to have envy at other for their
beauty / or their welfare / or plentuous temyng: these be the gifts of god /
as al other goodness be / that folks have. Wherefore they that envy for these /
seem not to have e^uie at them / that have these things / but to blame god /
which so distributeth his benyfytes. And me thinks there is no more cause
why / they should be envied / that have these / than they that carye bagage on
a long journey. For what other things be the goods of this world / but a
troublesome caryage and gardeuyaunce in this life. Yea and worste of all / they
pluck down with their weight unto the earth / minds that be going toward
heaven. But if envy be eschewed / tha^ shall that vice lightly be put away /
which commonly ryseth of envy / that is suit / chiding / scolding / and
making them self busye about other folks matters / to spy and search what
they do / what they say / how and by what means they live. Which thing none
honest woman will do / but such as be shameless / and worthy all kind of
rebuke: except they do hit of charity / to help them and they lack. For she
ought to help the pour man / and socoure the orphane child. Happy is she /
if that be her mind: of whom the prophet speaks i^ the psalm of this wise:
Blessed is he / that takes understanding and knowledge upon a pour man: god
shall deliver him in the evil day: our lord shall save him and quickene him /
and make him happy upon earth: and shall not commit him to his ennemies
will. Our lord shall socoure him upon the bed of his sorrow: good lord thou
have serched up all his bed in the time of his infermite.

What the Wife ought to do at home. The.x. Chaptre.
IF the Wife have skylle to rule an house with those.ii. propreties / ye we
spoke of before / that is honesty of body / and great love toward her
husband / than shall all the marriage be more welthye and fortunate: for
without this third point / can be no increase of house: and without the other
two / wedlock can not stand: but it is rather a sore and a perpetual
tourment. A woman of Lacedemon / taken ones prisoner in war / and asked of
her conqueror what she could do: I can said she / rule an house. Aristotle
says / that in house keeping / the man's duty is to get / and the woman's to
keep. Wherefore nature seems to have made them fearful for the same purpose /
lest they should be wasters / and has given them continual thought and care
for lackyng. For if the woman be over free / the man shall never get so much
as she will waste in short time: and so their house must needs sone decay.
Hit is not becommynge for an honest wife to be a great spender. Nor they be
lightly no great sparers of their honesty / that be so large of their money /
as Salust says by Sempronia / which set more price by any other thing /
than she did by her worship or her money. For a man could not well perceive /
whether she regarded less her money or her good name. How be it / I would not
have the woman to be to great a nygarde of her goods / or to let her husband
to distribute his money unto holy use. In so much that what penye someuer
comes ones with in her coffer / should never find way out again: as though
it were locked in Labyrynth / or Dankes toure: as many women do / which have
no discression / how they should save and keep a thing. Therefore the Essens
would take no women with them unto that holy and religious life / whithe they
led: because the women could not away with that co^monalte of goods. For
what so ever a woman sees ones in her hands / she can not suffer it to go
away again. Therefore let her use her householde to sobrenes and measure. For
that is more the woman's duetye than the man's. But so yet / that she have
discression betwent measure and auaryce / and sobernes and nygardeshyppe. For
it is not all one to live soberly / and be hungre. Therefore let her se that her
house hold lack not neither meat nor clothe. In which point / I would she
should here Aristotle's opinion. There be says he.iii. things / work / meat /
and correction: meat without correction and work, makes them proud and
wanton: and work and correction without meat / is a cruel entreatyng / and
makes the servants weak and feeble. Therefore let the wife give her servants
/ work to do / and sufficient meat / as is a servants duty. But let her
order all thing after her husbands will and commandment: or at the least in
such wise as she thinks that her husband will be content: neither be rough
and hard with her meyny / but gentle and favorable: and as saint Hieronyme
says / more like a mother than a maystres: and rather obtain reverence of
them with mekenes / than rygorousnes. Where unto she may shortly come by the
ways of virtue. For as for chidyng / braulyng / rayllyng / scoldyng / and
fyghting / does neither cause auctorite nor reverence / but rather hyndreth
them. But wisdom / discretion / sad conditions / and grauite of words and
sentences / brings all thing better to pass / than hedynes and violence. For
we fear more them that be wise and discrete / than them that be angry and
hasty. And a quiet rule may do more than rygorous. For quietness is of more
auctorite than hasty breemnes. How be hit I would not wives should be
sluggyshe and slothful / but I counsel them to use reverent grauite / and
neither sytte so still as though they slepte / nor comaunde so folisshely / to
make them self naught set by / but to wake and take heed / and be sad without
cruelty / sharp without bytternes / diligent without rigorousnes. Netther
hate none of their householde / if hit be not a noughty person. And if a
servant have done long seruise in her house / let her take him none other
wise than as her brother / or her son. We love cattes and dogs / that have
been norysshed any while in our houses: than how much more faith fully ought
we to show that favor unto our eue^ christen. Also servants again on their
party must be warned / to remember the saying of saint Paul / that they do
their duty diligently / mekely / and buxomly / yea and merrily to / and
pleasa^tly: nor babble / nor murmoure again: neither show any displeasant
countenance / lest they lose the thank of their labor / both before god and
man. Also keep their hands pure from pyckynge and stealing. In the which
point all wild beastis be more kind than many folks. For what wild beast
is so outrageous / that will pluck away any thing of his profet / by whom he
has be nourisshed and brought up: and quite him with such a turn / of whom
he has had so many pleasures. How be it no body does so / but they that be of
vile stomachs / and even worthy to be bonds. Therefore seruyng maids shall
love and worship their masters and maystresses / none other wise / than
though they were their fathers and mothers. For the nouryssher and brynger up
is as a father. Let the serving maids neither say nor do any thing / whereof
the good wife of the house or her daughters may take any example of ill. For
many times gyuynge ill example is worse than the deed hit self. But now to
speak of the wives again. Obedience and service optayned by fair means / is
more faithful and pleasant / than that which is gotten with fear. For I
would all fear should be away / but not obedience. Let not ye maistres be over
pleasant of speech to her men servants / neither compenable and merry / nor use
much co^uersacion with them / nor bold none of them to play and dalye with
her. I would they should love her / but yet not love her so much as obey her.
If she would not be fearedde of them as a maystres / yet cause them to
reverence her as a mother. For servants covet much their liberty: and if a
lyttel be given them / they will take more. I will not bid the man so straytly
to be ware / that he make not his servants over homelye with him / as I will
the woman / which I would should not be much conuersante among her
servants / nor meddle much with them / neither rebuke and correct the me^ /
but leave that for her husband to do. Let her be all to gether among her
maids / which I would should be of honest demeanor / and chaste of body /
where unto ye maistres shall help much with her example: and also with
teaching and showing / and diligent over lokynge / that nothing be preuye unto
her how her maids live. Let her lay remedies against vice / as hit were
preserues against sickness. If she spy or suspecte any that do not order them
self well / nor can not remedy it by chydyng or correction / put her out of
her house / for ye poison will sone infecte all that is nigh about it. And the
suspecious people thy^keth ye maids like their maystresses. How often says
saint Hieronyme / that the maystresses be judged and known by the maidens? In
so much that there is a proverb among the greeks / that whelps have their
maistresses conditions. The young men in Terence conjecture the maystresses
honest living / by ye maids course and neglyge^t apparel. The poet Homer
makes mention / yt wise Ulysses after he came home / killed the serving
maids that had lain with the wowers / because they both shamed and rebuked
his house / and were thoccasions of ieoperdye unto the chastity of his wife
Penelope: but she her self did keep her occupied with those crafts that I
spoke of in ye first book / and kept her servants at their work: and so did
chaste Lucrece / whom ye kings sons found watchyng and workynge upon wolle
among her maids / which thing a wife shall do more diligently and busyly /
if any part of the fyndyng of her house be gotten there by. Solomon where he
prayseth an holy woman / says: She fought for wolle and flexe / and wrought
by the counsel of her hands. Theano Metapontina / when one asked her / what
wife was the best / she answered with a verse of Homer in this manner:

She that works on wolle and web /
And keeps well her husbands bed.
By that diligence (says the wise king) she is made like a marchandes ship
/ bringing her bread from far country. And lest he should seem to call her
a sluggarde / he says moreover: And she rose by night / and gave praise unto
her house hold / and unto her maids / not only work but also recreation of
their labor and refection: whereof when they have had sufficient / she deals
the rest in almose. She has opened her hand says he / to the nedy / and
raught her fy^gers unto ye pour. A holy woman ought not to set her mind so
sore on gatherynge of goods: but that she distribute unto pour folks / and
help them that have need: nor that nygardelye / but largely: remembrynge that
she gives hit for her own advantage: and shall receive much more and better
reward / both in this world / and in an other. The wise man says: She
shall not care for her house / for fear of cold snow: she shall not fear /
though she give a penny unto a pour man / not only nygardly / wryngynge it
through her fyngers: but also with open hand largely: she shall not fear: for
by her diligence and occupyeng of woll / her house shall lack nothing /
necessary for both winter and somer: and all her householde shall be arrayed in
lyned clothyng. For there is nothing better in a house / tha^ to be well fed
and clothed: not for pleasure / but for their necessite: nor dilicatly / but
profitably. How be it virtue is ill kept / which is moved and intised with
contrary examples nygh about. Therefore let the wife her self first of all /
show example of sober fare: and so shall she make her servants the most
easily to follow the same: orels her servants will think hit not reason to
require of them / that she will not do her self. And so shall she ever have
them murmuring and grutchynge to keep her commandment. Therefore let her keep
her self ever sober / not so much because of her servants / as for her own
sake. For what a filthy thing is drounkenes and glotony? The greattest
assaylers of chastity and shamfastnes / and enemies of honest name. For every
man will abhor a drounke^ woman and a great gloutto^ / as an unlucky sign.
Every man knows / that chastity stands in ieoperdie among excess of
meats. I would ye wife should be ignorant of nothing that is in her house /
but look upon all thing often times / that she may have them redye in memory:
lest when she shall have need of them / either she shall not know of them /
orels have much trouble in seky^g of them. Also consider in what condition and
state her house hold stands: how much she may spe^de: how much she may
keep: how she may clothe: and how she may feed. For the wise man says: She
has considered the ways of her house. This diligence shall increase much her
house hold store. I would she should be ever among her maids: whether they
be in her kychene dressing of meat / orels spynnynge / or weauyng / or sowyng
/ or brusshyng. For while the maistres is by / all things shall be better
done. And as the wise men said / Nothy^ng shall better feed an horse / or
better tylle the ground / than the master and the masters to have an eye to
their householde store. There is nothing that keeps an house louger or better
tha^ does a diligent eye of the good wife. And wha^ she has done this / let
her be ever busy with her own work / neither eat her bread idell. And tha^
does she obey god / which would not have us to eat our breadde without sweet
of our face. And than she follows the example and precepte of saint Paul /
which did not eat his bread idel among them / unto whom he showed the
mysteries of our lord / but labored and toyled day and night / as much as
he had leysour from the minysteryng of gods word / and wroughte still /
because he would put no body to charge / often rehersynge and saying / that he
was not worthy to eat yt refused labor. The wife shall let no man come in to
the house / except her husband command. Which thing also Aristotle
byddeth. And when her husband is forth adores / than keep her house much
more diligently shut. And yet as Plautus says / it is convenient for a good
woman to be all one / both in her husbands absence and presence. And because
the busynes and charge with in the house lies upon the woman's hand / I would
she should know medycines and salues for such diseasis as be comen / and
rain almost daily: and have those medicynes ever prepared ready in some
closette / wherewith she may help her husband / her little children / and her
house hold meyny / when any needs / that she need not often to send for the
physician / or by all thing of the potycaries. I would she should know
remedies for such diseasis as come often / as the cough / the murre / and
gnawynges in the bealy / the laxe / costyfnes / the worms / the heed ache /
pains in the eyes / for the agewe / bones out of joint / and such other
things / as chance daily by light occasions. More over / let her learn to
know / what manner diet is good or badde / what meats is wholesome to take /
what to eschew / and how long / and of what fassion. And this I would she
should learn / rather of the experience and use of sad and wise women / than of
the counsel of any physician / dwelling nigh about: and have them diligently
written in some little book / and not in the great volummes of phisycke. A
virtuous wife / when she has ryd her householde charge and busynes / shall
every day ones / if she may / or at ye least on the holy days / get her self
in to some secreate corner of her house / out of company: and there for a
while / lay a part out of her my^de all care and thought of her house: and there
with a quiet my^de gatheryng her wits and remembrance unto her / despise
these worldly things as tryffels / frail / and unsure: and that sone shall
vanysshe away / and because the length of our life is so short / and passes
so swiftely / that hit seems not to be led away but plucked away / neither
to depart / but fly away. After this / let her lift up her mind unto the
study and contemplatyon of heuenlye things / by some holy redynge: than
confess her sins unto almighty god / and desire mekely per done and peace of
him: and pray first for her self: and than / when she is in more favor with
god / for her husband: and than for her children: and after for all her house
hold: that our lord Jesus of his grace would inspire good mind in to them.
Saint Paul / the messanger of almighty god / where he informed and taught the
church of the Corinthyans / beginning says in this wise: If any man have a
wife that is an infidel / if she be content to tarry with him / let him not
put her away. And if any Christen woman have an husband an infidel / if he
be content to dwell with her / ler her not go from him. For the man / that is
an infidel / shall be blessed by his faithful wife: and the woman that is an
infidel / shall be blessed by her faithful husband. For what canste thou
tell woman / whether thou shalt be cause of thy husbands salvation? Or what
canste thou tell man / whether thou shalt be cause of thy wives salvation?
Which saying prayneth partly unto prayer. For as saint James says / the
continual prayer of a good man or a good woman may do much: and part unto the
example of living. Which thing saint Peter the apostle shows / where he
says: Like wise women / be you subgettes unto your husbands / that they that
will not believe the word / may be won without the word / by their wives
conversation / when they consider your demeanoure in holy fear. I have
read of many Christen women / which by their means have brought their
husbands unto holy and virtuous living: as Domitia / which amended her
husband Flauius Clemens / kynse man unto the emperor Domitian: and Clotildis
/ wife unto Clodouius the king of France: and Iuguldis / wife unto
Hermogillus the king of Gothia: and many other women moo / which have brought
their husbands to good order and virtue.

Of children and the charge and care about them. The.xi. Chap.
First of all if thou bear no children / take it with a pacient and a co^te^t
mind: and in manner rejoice / yt thou lackest yt incredible pain and busynes.
There is no place here to declare / what mysery she must suffer / while she is
great: what dolor and perell / when she laboreth. More over / what werynes and
care she has in the nourisshyng and bryngyng up of them / lest they should
waxeyll / or any mysfortune by chance them: what continual fear she has /
whyther they go: what they do / lest they do or take any harm. Verily I can
not express ye cause of this great desire / that women have to bear children.
Would thou be a mother? Whereto? That thou may replenysshe the world: as
who say / the world could not be filled / except thou bring forth a little
beast or two: orelles that god could not reyse children unto Abraham of these
same stones. Be never careful in the house of god / how hit shall be filled:
he will provide well enough for his house / that it shall not be empty. But
parauenture thou feareste the rebuke of bare^nes. Thou art a Christen woman.
Therefore understand / that now this saying is past / Cursed be that woman in
Israel that is barenne. Thou lyueste now under a law / where in thou seeste
virginyte preferred above marriage: and herest the saying of thy lord: woe be
unto women / that be great and bear children: and blessed be they / that be
baren: blessed be the wombes that bear not / and the breast is that give not
souke. How can thou tell / whether god will have the to be one of those
happy and blessed women? How much more shamfully did the woman of Flaunders /
which had be married almost fyfty year / and never had child / and after that
her husband was deed / married unto another man / layeng only for her cause /
to prove whether the fault was in her self or in her husband / that she had
no children. Wherefore she was worthy to bear a child with great pain and
werynes: and in her labor to be delivered of her child and her life both /
with extreme tourment. How be it I can not tell / whether she had any other
cause to marye again / at the least wise she laid that / which seemed most
honest in the cares of the folisshe people. Paraue^ture thou would feign se
children comen of thine own body: shall they be of any other fassyon trowest
thou / than other children be? and thou haste children of the cite / and also
all other Christian children / whom thou may bear motherly affection unto.
And think that they be all thyn. For so the law of mankind does exorte the /
and our faith commands. Where to have you so great a delyre of children you
women? For if the cares and sorrows / that children cause unto their mothers /
were painted you in a table / there is none of you so gredy of children / but
she would be as sore aferde of them as of death: and she that has any / would
hate them like cruel wild beast is / or venymous serpents. What joy / or
what pleasure can be in children? Whiles they be young / there is nothing but
tediousnes: and when they be elder / perpetual fear / what ways they will
take: if they be il / everlasting sorrow: and if they be good / there is
perpetual care / lest they should dye / or some harm bechaunce them: and lest
they should go away / or be chan^ged. What need me to bring in Ortauia /
sister unto Augustus / for an example? I would there were not so many examples
/ as there be / of such as have be made of welthy and fortunate mothers
miserable / and pyned away / and died for sorrow. More over / if thou have many
/ than haste thou greatter care / where the vnthriftynes of one shall wype away
all the joy that thou have of the rest. And this I mean by the sons. Now
to speak of the daughters / what a tourment of care is hit to keep them? And
in maryeng them / what pain shall she have? beside this / ye few fathers and
mothers sees good children of their own. For very goodness which is never
without wisdom / comes not but in discreate age. Plato calls him happy /
that may attain in his last age unto wisdom and good life. But when the
children be of that age / fathers and mothers be turned to douste. O unkind
woman / that doste not reknowledge how great a benyfite thou haste had of god
/ that either never did bear children / orels lost them before the time of
sorrow? Wherefore Euripides said full well:

She that lacks children
Is happy of that mysfortune.
Therefore thou that bear not / put not ye fault of thy barennes in thy
husband: for the fault is parauenture in thy self: which art comdempned to
be baren / either by nature or by the will of god. And greattest philosophers
agree in this opinyon / that women bear no children more long of them self
than of their husbands. For nature never brought forth but very few baren
men / and many women. And that upon great consyderation / because there is more
loss in the barennes of the man / than of the woman. For there comes more
increase in generation by the man / than by the woman. Wherefore woman / if the
barennes be in the / thou dotest ungraciously in vain: for there shall never
man get the with child. And so thou conceiuest many ungracious deeds in thy
mind: but thou shalt never conceive any fruit in thy womb. And many times by
the ryghtous provision of god / unknown unto us / there comes none issue in
marriage. For like as hit is ye gyfre of god / that good children be hade / so
is it his gift / that any children be had at all. Therefore to seek any other
remedy than by prayer / is not only super fluous / but also a cursed deed.
Therefore ask children of god / and that good children. For if thou have an ill
child / hit were better bear a snake / or a wolf. Therefore ask thou a
child as Anna / wife unto Helcane / did ask: Which by prayer / wepy^g / and
holy living optayned a son / a prophet and judge of Israel / called Samuel:
like as the other Anne / wife unto Ioachim / which trustyng holly in god /
bare Mary the queen of the world / unto man's salvation. Also Elisabeth /
wife unto zachary / which had been baren / brought forth saint John^ / the
messynger of our lord: Which gatte many a child unto Christ: above ye which
saint Johan, there was never man borne of woman. Our lord gave Isaac the image
of Christ / and ye begynner of.ij. great nations of people / unto Sara in her
old age: which was not discontent with her barrennes / in that time / when
barrennes was rekened a great shame. The angel of our lord showed unto the
wife of Manna / a good and a chaste woman / that Sampson should be borne of her
/ the judge and delyuerer of Israel. Such children do they obtain / that so
ask. For they that be conceived of sin and wickedness / can be naught else /
but ungraciousness. The words of the angel unto Sampsons mother be these. Thou
art baren and without children: how be it thou shalt conceive and bear a
son. Therefore se thou drink neither wine nor ale / nor eat any vnpure
thy^g. For thou shalt conceive and bear a son / whose heed no razec shall
touch: for he shall be blessed of god from his babes age / and from the womb of
his mother: and shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the
philystyns. These words put me in remembrance now / to give women with
child warnyng / that so long as they be great / they neither eat so much to
take surfeit of / nor drink to be drounke with. For many children have
afterward used ye same things / that their mothers delited in / wha^ they
were with child with them. Now for to declare / what diligence ought to be
given to children in the bringing up of them / were to long to be
comprehended in this book / if I should teach every thy^g at large. Whereof
many counnyng men / both of old time and late / have written much in books
made purposely for ye same matter. I will touch a few things / ye methy^ke
pertayne unto the duty of a wise house wife.

First of all / let the mother reken her children to be all her treasure.
There came upon a time a great rich woman unto Rome / out of the country of
Campanya / which was hosted and lodged with the noble woman Cornelia / wife of
Gracchus: there this rich woman showed out her great treasure unto Cornelia /
abundaunde of silver and gold / rich raymentes / and precious stones: Which
when Cornelia had preysed / than desired this woman of Campany / that she would
do so much again / as show her treasure: Cornelia answered / that she would
do so at night. Now were her children gone to schole / and were not yet comen
home. So at night / wha^ the children were come^ home / she showed them unto
this woman / and said: these be my chief treasure. Another time a certain
woman of Ionia / made great boste and show of glorious clothes / of great
price and goodly work / Cornelia said: this woman makes great bost of her
clothes / but my four sons, endued with all kind of virtue / be unto me in
stead of precious clothes / with costly work / and all treasure. Therefore in
keeping of this treasure / and increasyng it / there is no labor to be refused.
Love shall make all labor light and easy. Wherefore she shall nourisshe them
with her own milk: and obey the commandment of nature / which gyuyng.ij.
breastis with milk / unto every woman delivered of child / seems to cry and
bid every woman / that has borne child / to keep child as other living
creatures do. Also that wise and lyberall mother of all thing / Nature has
turned all that blood / which went unto ye nourisshement of the child /
while hit was in the mothers womb / after that the child is borne / she
sends hit up unto the breastis / turned into white milk / to nourisshe
the child with all: neither forsakes the tender babe / after that it is borne
/ but nourissheth hit with the same fode / where of she has made hit. But I
have spoken enough of this matter in the book before. After wards / if the
mother can skyll of lernyng / let her teach her little children her self /
that they may have all one / both for their mother / their nouryse / and
their teacher. And that they may love her also the more / and learn with better
courage / and more speed / by the means of the love / that their teacher has
toward them. As for her daughters / she shall beside the lernyng of ye book /
instruct them also with womennes crafts: as to handle wolle and flexe / to
spynne / to weaue / to sow / to rule and over se an house. Neither a virtuous
mother ought to refuse learning on the book / but now and than study and read
holy and wise me^nes books: and though she do it not for her own sake / at the
least wise for her children / that she may teach them / and make them good: As
Euridice / when she was of great age / set her self unto learning / and
study of philosophy / only to thentent / that she might teach her children:
and so she did. For the babe first hereth her mother / and first begins to
inform her speech after hers. For that age can do nothing it self / but
cou^terfet and follow other: and is counnyng in this thing only. She takes her
first conditions and information of mind / by such as she hereth / or sees
by her mother. Therefore it lies more in the mother / tha^ meu wene / to make
the conditions of the children. For she may make them whether she will / very
good / or very badde. Now how she shall make them good / I will give a few
short rules. Let her give her diligence / at least wise by cause of her
children / that she use no rude and blounte speech / lest that manner of spekyng
take such route in the tender minds of the children / and so grow and
increase together with their age / that they can not forget it. Children will
learn no speech better / nor more play^ly express / tha^ they will their
mothers. For they will counterfete both the virtue and the vice / if any be in
it. James / the king of Aragone / after that he had won my country Valence /
out of the hands of the Agarenes / which inhabited the city that time / he
drove out the people / and commanded men of Aragon / and women of Ilerda to go
dwell in hit. So the children that came of them both / with all their
posterite / kept their mothers language: which we speak there unto this day.
For the space of more than.ij. hundred and.l. year. Tyberius Gracchus / and
Gayus Gracchus / were counted the most eloquent me^ of Rome / and they learned
it of their mother Cornelia / whose epistols were red in the old world / full
of pure eloquence. Istrina the queen of Scythia / wife unto king Aripithis /
taught her son Syles ye greek tongue. Also Plato commands / that nurces shall
not use to tell unto children vain and tryflyng fables. This same thing is to
be charged unto the mothers tongue. For by the reason of such bryngyng up: some
/ after they be come to sadder age / have such childysshe and tender
stomachs* that they can not abide to here any thing of wisdom or sadness /
but delight all together in books of peuysshe fables / which neither be true /
nor lykelye. Therefore mothers shall have ready at hand pleasant histories and
honest tales / of the comendatio^ of virtue / and rebukynges of vice. And let
the child here those first: and when it can not yet tell what is good and what
is badde / it shall begin to love virtue and hate vice: and so grow up and
wax with those opinyons: and shall go about to be like unto them / whom he
has hard his mother commend: and unlike unto those / who she has
dispraysed. The mother shall rehearse unto them the lauds of virtue / and the
disprayse of vice / and repete often times / to drive them in to the childre^s
remembrance. I would she should have some holy sayenges and precepts of
living commenly in use / which hard diverse times / shall at ye last abide
in the childrens remembrance / though they give no head unto them. For
children rounne unto their mother / and ask her advise in all thing: they
inquite every thing of her: what some ever she answers / they believe and
regard and take hit even for the gospel. O mothers what an occasion be you
unto your children / to make them whether you will / good or badde? Than should
right and good opinions / and the pure faith of Christ be enfunded in to their
minds / to despise riches / power / honor / pomp / nobilite / and beauty /
and to reken them for vain and folisshe things: but justice / devotion /
boldenes / co^tynence / counnyng / mekenes mercy / and charity with mankind /
to reken these things goodly / and worthy to be regarded and used: and to
count them the true and sure goods. Neither to have in honor such men / in
whom those things be / that we spoke of before / but in whom these be. What
someuer shall be spoken of any man / or done wisely / wyttyly / or honestly /
let her praise it unto them. And what someuer any man has done leudely /
subtylly / falsely / shamfully / wickedlye / vngratiously / rebuke that sore.
When she enbraseth her child and kysseth it / and will pray hit some good
luck / let her not pray of this fassion: God make the rycher than ever was
Cresus / or Crassus: god make the more honorable / than ever was Pompeus or
Caesar: god make the more fortunate tha^ ever was Augustus. But let her pray on
this fassion: Christ give ye grace to be good and continent / and to despise
fortune of the world / to be virtuous / and follow his steppis to do after
saint Paul / and make the more just tha^ ever was Cato / holyer than Socrates
or Senecke / more counnyng than Plato or Aristotle / or more eloquent thanne
Demosthenes or Tullius. These let her reken for great things / and to be
desired. These let her seek and wisshe for / that would pray for good things.
Let ye mother never laugh at any word or deed of the child / done leudelye /
shamfully / noughtely / wantonly / or piercely / nor kiss it therefore. For
children will lightly use them self unto such things / as they se be
pleasant and delectable / unto their father and mother: nor will not love them
/ after they be comen to man's or womans estate. Therefore the mother shall
correct the child for such doing: and let it know / that it neither does
well / nor she is not co^te^t there with. And again on the other side / let her
enbrace and kiss it / when so ever it does any thing that is a sign of
goodness. The stoicke philosophers say / that there be certain fyeres or seeds
/ whether you will call them / bredde by nature in us / of ye same justice / in
the which that first father of mankind was made by almighty god: that littell
fire / if it might increase in us / it would bring us up unto the perfection
of virtue / and blessed lyuyuge. But it is drowned with corrupt opinions and
iugeme^tes. And when it begins to light and flame up a littell / it does
not only lack nourisshement / but also is quenched with contrary blastis of
wind. Fathers and mothers / nources / scholemaysters / kyns folks / friends /
acquayntance / and the commen people / which is a master of great error /
all these do that they can to pluck up those seeds / of virtue by the routes /
and to over whelme that littell fire / as soon as it begins to appear. But
all they regard riches much / and give honor unto nobilite / and reverence
unto honor / and seek for power / and praise beauty / and worship pomp / and
follow pleasures. But they trede poverty under fete / and mock simple my^des.
They suspecte devotion / and hate counnynge: and all kind of virtue they call
folly. And wha^ someuer they pray for any thing / they wysshe for those that I
spoke of before. But if any body ones name these other things / they abhor
them as unlucky signs. And therefore these lie under fete / and be dispysed.
Neither any man applies himself unto them: but those other things be in
regard and price: and all men rounneth unto them. For whereof I pray you
comes this / that we have so many leude fellows and fools / and so few good
and wise men? When that the good nature of mankind is more inclined of it own
self unto virtue / than unto vice. Therefore a good wife shall withstand these
corrupted opinions / with other better / and more mete for Christen folks: and
shall nourisshe up in her children that little fire / that I spoke of before:
and water those seeds with the drops of good teaching / that the fire may
rise up unto great light / and the seeds unto much and good corn. Let her not
break the strength both of their bodies / their wits / and virtue / with
wanto^ and daynty bryngyng up. I have seen very few men come to great proof of
either lernyng / wit / or virtue / that had be dayntly brought up. Neither
the bodies can come unto their due strength / wha^ they be febled with delicate
keeping. And so when mothers wene they save their children / they lose them:
and when they go about to keep them in health and strength / they folysshly
mynysshe both their health and their life. Let them love their children well /
as conuenyent is and spare not. For who would either anull or dispreyse the
law of nature? Or what a cruelty is hit / not to love them that thou have
borne? But yet let them hyde their love / lest ye children take boldenes there
upon / to do what they list. Nor let not love stop her to punisshe her
children for their vices / and to strength their bodies and wits with sad
bringing up. For you mothers be the cause of most part of ylnes among
folks: whereby you may se / how much your children are beholding unto you /
which induce noughty opinions in to them with your folly. For you have the
bryngyng up of them: and you allow their vnthriftynes. And when they be going
unto high virtue / and abhor the riches of the world / and the pomp of the
devil: you with your weeping / and sharp rebukynge / call them back again
in to the deuylles snares: because you had leauer se them rich tha^ good.
Agrippyna / mother unto the emperor Nero / when she had asked south sayers of
her son / whether he should be emperor / yea said they / but he shall kill
his mother: let him kill her said she / so that he may be emperor. And so he
both was emperor and killed her. But when it came to ye point / Agrippyna
would not gladly have been killed / and repented that her son had thempyre.
Finally you / through your cherishyng will neither let them take labor to
learn virtue: and have a pleasure to fill them full of vices with delicatenes.
Therefore many of you weep and wayle (for I speak not of all) and be well
punysshed and worthyly in this life / for your madness. When you be sorry to se
your children such as your self have made them. Nor you be loved of them
again / when they perceive them self vnloued of all other for your love.
There is a certain tale of a young man / which wha^ he was led to be put to
death / desired to speak with his mother: and when she came / laid his mouth
to her ear / and bote it of: And when ye people that were by rebuked him:
cally^g him not only a these / but also cursed / for so entreatynge his mother
/ he answered again: This is the reward for her bryn gynge up. For if she /
said he / had corrected me for stealing my fellows book out of the schole /
which was my first theft: tha^ had I not proceeded unto these mischeuous
deeds. But she cherysshed me / and kyssed me for my doing. Now where to should
I rehearse the madness of those mothers / that love better those children / that
be foul / crooked / leude / dullardes / sluggardes / drou^kerdes / unruly /
and folisshe / than those / that be fair / vpryght / counnyng / quick witted
/ inuentyue / sober / treatable / quiet and wise? Whether is this an error of
folks minds / or a punysshement of god / deserved for their syns / to make
them to love such things / as be worthy no love? Du^me beastis cherysshe ever
the fairest of their whelps / or birds / and lightly hit is a sign of good
proffe in them / when the da^mes make much of them. Also hu^ters know that
that shall be the best dog / which ye damme is most busye about / and for whom
she cares the most / and carries first in to her lytter. But in mankind that
is the most vile and the least worth / that the mother loves most tenderly.
If you will beloved in deed of your children / and specially in that age / when
they know what is true and holy love / tha^ make them not to love you over
much / when they know not yet what love is: but set more by a spised cake /
a hunnye comb / or a piece of sugare / than by both father and mother. No
mother loved her child better tha^ mine did me: neither any child did ever
less perceive him self loved of his mother than I. She never lyghtely laughed
upon me: she never cokered me: and yet wha^ I had been.iii. or.iiij. days out
of her house / that she wist not where / she was almost sore sick. And when I
was comen home / I could not perceive that ever she longed for me. Therefore
was there no body / that I more fled / or was more loathe to come nyghe / than my
mother / when I was a child. But after I came to young man's estate / there
was no body / whom I delited more to have in syghte. Whose memory now I have
in reverence / and as afte as she comes to my remembrance / I enbrace her
with in my mind and thought / when I can not with my body. I had a friend at
Paris / a very well learned man: Which among other great benefits of god /
rekened this for one: that his mother was dead / that sherysshed him so
wonderously: Which (said he) if she had lived / I had never come to Paris to
learn: But had sit still at home all my life / among dicyng / drabbes /
delycates / and pleasures / as I begounne. How could this man love his mother
/ that was so glad of her death? But a wise mother shall not wysshe for
pleasures unto her child / but virtue? Nor for riches / but for counnyng / and
good fame. And rather for an honest death / than for an uncomely life. The women
of Lacedemon / had leauer their sons should dye honestelye for the defense of
they* country / than fle to save their lives. And we read in histories / that
many of them have killed with their own hands / their sons / that were
cowardes and dastardes / pronouncyng these words:

This was never my son /
Nor borne in Lacedemone.
Sophia which had.iij. goodly daughters / named them with.iij. names of virtue
/ hope / faith / and charity / and was very glad to se them all dye for the
honor of Christ / and buried them her own self / not far from Rome / in
ye time of Hadryan the emperor. Let not the mothers be so dilligent in teaching
their children crafts to get good by / as to make them virtuous. Neither
shall bydde them take example of such as have gathered much goods in short
space: but rather of such as have comen unto great virtue and goodness. The
people of Megara is dispreysed / and not without a cause / for teaching their
children nygardshyppe and couetyse: and instead of honest children / made them
sparynge bond men. Wherefore they caused such things / as wese chaunseth now
adays / that with byddyng them so often / seek for good / get good / increase
their good / and gether good by all means / they caused their children to do
myschiefe and ungracious deeds. The which fault is a great part in the
fathers and mothers / which be cou^saylours / causers / and setters upon / and
as good reason was / when the children could find none other ways to come by
riches / they robbed their fathers and mothers. And if they saw that all was
so well and closely laid up / that they could not come by it / than begou^ne
they to hate their fathers and mothers / and wysshe for their dethes / and seek
means to rydde them away. And hit is plainly known / that many have poisoned
their fathers and mothers / because they thought to long / to tarry till they
dyed for age. Often times they rebuke their fathers and mothers of their own
vices / as though they had learned them by their example or negligence. For the
unthrifty young man / which had an unthrifty father / said of this fassyon: I
will impute mine vnthriftynes unto my father. For I was not brought up with
sad meanour / neither under the law of a well ordered house / which moughte
have instructed my manners better / and plucked me from those vices / that mine
age was inclyned to. But when that first age of children ought to be holden
under / and kept in by sad orderyng / lest it fall unto vice / through over
mothe liberty / from which it will be hard to pluck them again: and as the
wise man counsayleth / never have the rod of the boys back: specially the
daughters should be handled without any cherysshyng. For cherysshyng marreth ye
sons / but hit utterly distroyeth the daughters. And me^ be made worse with
over much liberty / but the women be made ungracious. For they be so set upon
pleasures and fantasyes / that except they be well brydled and kept under /
they rounne on heed in to a thousa^de myscheffes. Now how the daughters
ought to be brought up / I have showed in the book before. Therefore ye mother
shall read hit / both because there be many things pertaining unto married
women / and because hit is the mothers duty / to se that the daughters do that
we teach there. And when the mothers have provided as well as they ca^ by
words / that no foul / uncomely / or uncleanly thing / or ieoperdous / or
ungracious abide in the childs mind / than shall they provide most of all /
both by example and deeds / that the child se nothing / which can not he
counterfeted and followed without shame. For as I said before / yt age is even
almost like an ape / and does nothing of it self / but all by counterfetynge
of other. And though the fathers and mothers by their auctorite and love / and
also commandment / put the ill examples of other folks out of the chyldrens
minds / yet they can not rebuke that they do them self: or though they would
rebuke it / yet will not children be so much moved with that / yt they here /
as with that / that they se. Wherefore the poet Iuuenall says full well / that
thexamples of fathers and mothers / may do more / than a great deal of warnyng
and teaching / of a great sort of masters: for they shall do them more hurt
by thexample of one ill deed / tha^ they have done them good by much holy
counsaylyng. And therefore the before said poet counsayleth wifely in the.xiiii.
Satyr on this manner.

Let nothing / that is fylthy to speak or se /
Come nere those doors / wherein children be.
Away with songs of baudes / wenches light /
And skoffyng iauels / that walken all night.
Thou should give children great reverence /
If thou go about any inconuenyence.
Nor set at light a childs years and age:
But when thou fallest in to outrage:
Yet for thy little child which is in sight:
Refrain that foul act with all thy might.
Celius Plinius dispreiseth Numydia Ouadratilla / because she kept and
sherisshed players and testers / more than was conuement for a noble woman. Not
with standing he commends the elde womans wisdom in this point / because
she would not suffer her Neuewe Quadratus / to look upon her players / neither
with in her house / nor in the common playeng place. And wha^ someuer she would
here them / or was about to take her pastyme in playenge at the cheseis / she
used to commau^de her neuewe to go his way and study his book. The same before
said Plinius / gives great thanks by a letter unto Hyspula / his wives au^te
/ because she had brought up and instructed his wife with good learning /
which never saw any thing in her auntes house / but honest and virtuous: and
no doubt / much more diligence ought to be given about the daughters / that
nothing blotte their demucenes / thastite / or sadness / because these things
be required more perfect in a woman than a man. And the females in all kinds
of beastis be follow example most wittily / and ever more redely and more
peiferely the vices / which thing the male does also. Wherefore she will
lightly do that / which she sees her mother do / or any other woman that she
sees regarded of folks. Neither she can refrain her self / if she have
their example for auctorite. Wherefore in such countres / where the noble and
gentle women be badde / there be but few of the low degree and comunaltie
good. And than they that be brought up of ill women / be not lightly any other
them self. How be it ye daughter resembles not so much her mother / as her
ye has brought and norisshed her up. Wherefore many bastardes / which have be
brought up with their graunmothers on the fathers side / being virtuous women
/ have gone out of their mothers ky^de / and felowed the life and holiness of
their granmothers / that nourisshed them. Cato thelder / banysshed Gaius
Manlius out of the senate house / because he kyssed his own wife / his
daughter being by. For that ignorant age understands not / Wherefore every
thing is done / but it will represe^t the same actis / like as a glass
represents the fassions of bodies / set before it / but not in the same
condition. Which thing the most wise and holy man Eleazar understanding /
when he was commanded by yt statute of king Antiochus / to eat swynes flesh
/ and refused it / and was counseled by pagannes that were his friends / at
least wise to make countenance / as though he did eat hit / that he might
under yt color escape / as though he had obeyed the kings will / he made
answer that he had leauer dye / than do any thing that might give ill example
to young folks / and spoke unto them in these words. For it is not convenient
nor becommyng for mine age / to use any symulation / that young men may
suspecte Eleazer / which now is paste ixxx. yet is and ten of age / is
turned unto the life of alyantes and infidels: and so they by the means of my
symulation / and for a litell space of this corruptible life / shall be
disceyued: and by that means shall I get a shame and course unto mine old age.
For though I escape the punysshement of men / at this present time: yet shall I
not escape the hands of almighty god / neither quick nor dead. Wherefore I
will do as is be coming for mine age / dye boldly / and leave an example of
noble stomach unto young men / when I shall take an honest death with a ready
and bold mind / for the most holy and virtuous laws. As soon as this was
said / he was straight carried unto execution / and they that led him / which
were more favorable to him before / were than displeased / for the words that
he had spoken / which they thought yt he had said of p^sumtion / but wha^ he
was nygh beaten to death / he tried out and said: Lord thou that haste holy
knowledge / thou know plainly / that when I might have been delivered from
death / yet I suffer hard pains of my body: and I suffer them gladly with all
mine heart / for dread of the. And so he departed away / leaving a memorial
of his death / for an example of virtue and boldenes / not only unto young men
/ but unto all his nation. Therefore the sons should be informed and taught
with examble of their father. Neither there ought any thing to be showed unto
them / that may be turned lyghtely unto vice / lest they turn it more
lyghtely / both by the reason of their own ignorance / and by ye reason of
man's nature / which is inclyned unto the wors. Our lord punysshed Hely /
the judge and bishop of Israel / not because he gave any ill example unto his
sons Ophin and Phinees / but because he did not punysshe his ill and
ungracious sons. Therefore he perysshed with a fall out of his chair / and
the heritage of his benifice was given away unto another kynred. Now how
much more grievous vengeance will he take upon such fathers / as teach their
children either by counsel / or by their example / to live vngratiously: and
seeing that the punysshement of the sons which were adulterars / redounded
unto the father / because he did not prohibet them / as much as lay in him:
What shall he do to such fathers / that excite and move their children unto
lechery / pleasures / and ungracious acces / either with words / orels with
deeds? And on the other side / of the woman that accustonies her children unto
virtue / the master of the pagannes saint Paul / speaks in this manner? The
woman has gone out of the way by transgressyon / how be hit she shall be
saved by bringing for the of children / if she continewe in faith / charity /
and holiness with chastity.

Of twyse married women / and of stepmothers. The.xij. Chap.
SVche as marye again / after the death of their first husbands / beside all
that we have write here before / must be warned this thing / to take heed /
lest they displease their husbands / which they have / with over much
rehersyng of their first husbands. The condition of the world is such / that
ever folks reken things past better than things that be present: the cause
why is / because no felicite is so great / but it has much displeasure and
bytternes myngled with it: which so long as it is p^sent / greueth us fore:
but wha^ it is ones gone / it leaves no great feeling of it self behind it:
and for that cause we seem ye less troubled with sorrows paste / tha^ with
sorrows present. Also age rounneth on a pace / which may every day wors than
other suffer displeasure / and is more feeble to sustain casualties chaunsynge.
More over the remembrance of the fourther and more lustye age / and as it were
a comparyson of hit with the more paynfull age / causes great werynes of the
present state / and longing for that which is past. But Solomon would not
have such thoughts to come in to the mind of a wise man / for to reken the
years past better than the years present. Neither a wise woman ought to count
or reken her husband / which is dead / better tha^ him / which she has on
live. For they be often disceyued in this point / because / if any thing
dislyke them in their husband / whom they have / than call they to
remembrance only such points as pleased them in their first husbands. And
that thing they do ye more spiteously / if their present husband discontent
their mind in those things / wherein their first husbands did them pleasure /
than without all consyderation of other things / they compare their husbands
together only in that: and there upon ryseth pain / whynynge / and troublous
words / again their husbands. And whiles they bewail and complain the mys
of their dead husband / they keep another. As for stepmothers they have an ill
name / as malicious toward their husbands children: of the which thing there
be many examples in memory. Therefore women must be warned often to rule their
own braydes and fantasyes of mind: for there of comes the fountain and
beginning of all both ill and good. And if thou suffce thy braydes to rule the
/ they will bring upon the a great noumber of troubles / and myseryres / which
afterward thou shalt not lyghtely shake of. But if thou rule them / thanne
shalt thou live holly and fortunatly. And that thing thou shalt obtain / if
thou will study diligently / whiles thy mind is at rest and quietness / how
thou may behave thy self / when causes of motion and trouble come upon the.
Therefore stepmothers be not rough and unreasonable / saving such / whose
passions and braydes of mind plays the tyra^tes over them: and they do not
rule their braydes / but follow and serve them. For she that is led with
discretion / reason / and co^syderation / shall reke^ her self and her
husband all one. And therefore she shall count both his children and hers
comen to them both. For if that friendship make all thing comen among friends /
in so much that many have loved and fauoredde their fre^des children as their
own / how much more abundantly and perfetly ought wedlock to cause the same
/ which is the highest degree / not only of all frendshippes / but also of all
blood and kynred. Moreover / she ought to have compassyo^ of their tender and
weak age / in remembrance of her own. For if she have children / she shall
love others to remembrynge that the chance of the world is in difference /
and that her children shall find such favor of other folks / whether she
dye or live / as she has showed to other folks children. And in deed a good
woman will be unto her husbands children that / which she may here them call
her so often / that is mother. For what woman is so far out of all humanyte
and ge^tilnes / that will not be moved and mytygated with this word / mother /
of whom so ever hit is said. And specially of children / which can not
flatter / but speak so eue^ with their stomach / like as they would their own
mother / of whom they were borne? How sweet is the name of friendship? How
many displeasures and hateredes does it put away: Them / how much more
effectual ought the name of mother to be / which is full of incredible
charity? Thou most irefull woman / do thou not mollyfye / when thou herest
thy self named mother? Thou art more ragious than any wild beast / if that
name wyllnat stir the. For there is no beast so ragious and cruelle / but if
another young of hit own kind faune upon hit / hit will be by and by mylde
unto hit. And thy husbands children can not make the gentle and mylde with
sweet words. Thou art called mother / and show thy self an enemy. Thou
many times gatherest hate without cause / and vseste upon that weak and
immcent age. And when it were conuenyent / that all Christen me^ should be as
brethren to the in beniuole^ce and charity / thou hate those / that be
conjoined unto the in house and blood / and that be brethren unto thy
children. Hit is maruayle / that the soul of their mother does not pursue the
/ vex and trouble the. Do you understand / you stepmothers that be such /
that your unruly ire and hate comes but of the dreams of your own folly.
For why do not stepfathers hate their wives children in like manner? For there
is no stepfather / but heloueth his wives say as well as his own. I have read
of many stepfathers / that has given the inheritance of realms unto their
wives sons / even as they had been their own / as Augustus sefte thempyre of
Rome unto Tyberius / and Claudius unto Nero * And yet had Augustus childrens
children and children of them agaye: and Claudins had a son. Which thing
they did not for lack of knowledge / that they were not their own sons / but
because they perceived in reason and consideration / that there was no cause of
hate between stepfathers and steppesonnes / except their own condition did
cause it. For what offense has stepsonnes made unto their stepfathers /
except they have offended them because they were not their own sons. As for
yt thing lay in gods hands / and not in man's power. Yea but some would
say / ye stepfathers do not play and trifle with their stepso^nes / as their
mothers would. To make answer there unto / by that argument their natural
fathers do not love them. But whereto should I say any thing of the stepfathers
love / when there be some mothers so mad / that they wene their husbands love
not their own natural children / because they do not trifle and fool with
them all the day and all the night still / as them self does. Man can not
dote as the woman can. For that same strong stomach of man can hold and cover
love well enough / and rules it / and does not obey hit. But you stepmothers
/ why do not you ever kiss / comb / and pyke your stepchildren / as you do
your own: there is so great darkness of mysty fa^tasies i^ your my^des / yt
what so ever you love / you thy^ke every body should love yt same / and that no
man loves yt enough: and what so ever you hate / you think is worthy to be
hated of every man / and that every body loves that to much. And some there
be / which wha^ they hate their stepsonnes deadly / yet they swear they love
them: which be mad / and if they believe / that any man will believe them: And
yet they be more mad / if they wene to disceyue god. Do thou look after /
that Christ should here the / wha^ thou call him father / when thou
wrythyest away from the step children / calling the mother? Saint Johan
thappostle does not believe that any such does love the invisible god / that
hates his brother / whom he looks upon.

How she shall behave her self with her kynsfolkes and alyaunce. The.xiii.
Chap.
THe great learned man Nigidius Figulus says / the deryuation and signification
of sister is as though I would say / separate and going aside / because she
is separate and goes in to another house and kynred. Which thing seeing it is
so / yt woman that is married shall begin to be more seruyseable unto her
alyaunce / than to her kyns folks / and so hit is convenient for many causes.
Forced / because she is as it were skyfted and planted in to that kyn / unto
which she shall bear children / and the which she shall multtylye with her
temynge. Secondly / because she has the benyuole^ce and love of her own
kynsfolkes already. Therefore she must seek for the love of her alyaunce after
wards. Thyrdlye / that her children may have the more love of their fathers
kynted / when they shall be helped not only with the beniuolence of their
father / but also of their mother. And in short conclusion / hit shall be
cause of many pleasures / if thou be loved of thine alyaunce / and many
displeasures if thou be hated. And this was the thing that those men looked
after / which skyfted manage out of kynred in to other folks / that love and
frendshyp among peaple might spread the brother. Therefore it is convenient /
diligently to get the love of thine alyaunce / or if thou have it all ready / to
keep and hold it. Hit is said / yt mothers in laws bear a stepmothers hate
unto their daughters in laws. And again / daughters in laws bear no great
love and charity toward their mothers in law. Therefore Terence after the
common custom and opinyon of people / says: All mother in laws hate their
daughter in laws. And these was a merry woman / which when she saw her mother
in laws image made in sugare / she said / hit was bitter. Plutarche / and
saint Hieronyme taking of his auctorite / where he writes agay^st Iouinian /
tells / that it was an old custom in Lepers / a cite of Affcyke / yt a new
married wife / on the next day after her marriage / should come unto her mother
in law / and pray her to lend her a port: and she should say she had none:
to thenre^t that the young wife might know / by and by after her marriage / the
stepmotherly hate of her mother in law / and be less grieved afterward / if
any thing bechanced that she would not. But wha^ I consider the cause of this
enemyte / me think both their enuies very folysshe. For the man stands as
hit were in the mids between his mother and his wife: and so either of them
hates other / as an expulser of her self. The mother is discontent / that all
her sons love should be turned unto her daughter in law: and the wife can
not suffce any to beloved / but her self. And there of ryfeth hate / envy /
and braulyng / as it were be twene two dogs / if a man stryke and sherysshe
the one ye other being bye. Pythagoras scholars in old time / and those that
were of his sect / did not reken friendship mynysshed / the mo that come unto
it: but to be ye more increased and stre^gthed: so the mother ought not to
think her self a mother ever the less / if her son marye a wife: nor the
wife ought to count her self a wife the less / if she have a mother in law:
but rather either of them ought to reconsile the man unto the other / if any
discord chance between them. Thou folishe mother in law / would thou not
have thy son to love his wife / which is a companyon and friend inseparable?
Coudeste thou have suffered not to have been loved of thine own husband? What
greatter mysery can thou wisshe unto thy son / than for to dwell with his
wife with displeasure? And thou folysshe daughter in law / woldeste not thou
have thy husband to love his mother? do not thou love thy mother? Thou
shall be loved of thy husband: as his fellow and dear mate: and thy husband
shall love his mother / as unto whom he is dounde / for his life his norisshyng
/ and his bryngyng up: and therefore he owes great love and kyndnes. The
daughter in law / knowing that her husband and she is all one / shall reken
her husbands mother her own / and shall love her and reverence her no less
than her natural mother / but be more seruiseable unto her / that she may
bind her the more to love her. She shall not be displeased / if her husband
love his mother / but rather and she be a good and a virtuous woman / if she se
him not behave him self unto his mother according like / she shall exhort
him and desire him to behave him self as a son ought unto his mother. There is
no mother in law so out of reason / but she will be the better content / if
she know her daughter in law chaste / and loving to her husband. Agrippina /
nece unto Augustus the emperor by his daughter Iulia / which was married unto
Germanicus / neuew unto Liuia the^presse / by her son Drusus / she was hated
of Liuia / both as a daughter i^ law / and as a stepdoughter / and was of her
own nature both sharp and shrewed enough: but she was so chaste of body /
and so loving unto her husband / that with those two virtues she altered ye
fyerce mind of her mother in law Liuia / and turned hit to good. The
daughters in law ought to nourisshe and sustain their mothers in law in
their necessite / none other wise / thanne if they were their own mothers.
Ruth / a Moabite borne / left her country and all her kynne / for her mother
in law / because she would not leave the old miserable woman in sorrow and
heaviness. Therefore she both comforted her with words / and nourisshed and
found her with her labor / and in all conditions fulfilled the room of a
daughter: neither that same great charity of Ruth lacked reward: For by the
counsel and help of her mother in law she gate Booz unto her husband / a
great rich man / and bare Isai the prophet / and was graundemother to king
David / of whose stock our lord Christ was borne.

How she shall live with her son or her daughter married / and how with her
sonnne in law and daughter in law. The.xiiij. Chap.
AS it is convenient for the wife to apply her self unto her husbands
discretion and will in all other things: so when any of her children shall be
married / and that both Aristotle in the second book of house keeping / teaches
/ and reason byddeth / that the holle auctorite over the children should be
given to the fathers. So by the laws of Rome / children were not under the
mothers rule / but the fathers: and that so long as he lived / though they
were married / and of great age / except they were at their own liberty. Now
how great power ought fathers to have over their own children / wha^ god
would ye Joseph should have some auctorite over Christ? Changell of our lord
/ what time he showed unto Iosephe in his dream / that that / which was in
the womb of Mary / was not conceived by man's generation / but by the power
and work of the holy ghost: She shall said he / bear a son / and thou
shalt call his name Jesus. He said not / she shall bear the a son / as
thuse is to say to the own fathers. For women bear children unto their
husbands: and yet he said / thou shall call him. Whereby he signyfied the power
and auctorite of him / which was his father apparent / when he had said unto
ye virgin / His name shall be called Jesus. A wise woman shall not pursue her
daughter in law / nor wene yt she wynneth love with hatyng her / neither of her
nor of her son. If she love her / and give her good counsel / and teach
her: And if she do before her such things / as may be example unto her
daughter in law / both of chastity and so bernes: And if she make no discord
between the married couples / but if any chance between them by reason of other
/ avoid it / and reconsyle them again with all her might: Finally / if she
bear a motherly affection toward her daughter in law / she shall lyghtely
bring to pass / that both her son shall be more bound unto her / and
shall obtain great love and reverence of her daughter in law. For how much
more shall he love her / of whom he has been borne / and by whom he has his
wife / both more chaste and more sober / and better agreynge with him / whereby
he shall be bound unto her not only for that benyfite / that she is his mother
/ but also because she has be ye instructrice of his wife / and causer of a
great part of his felicite? And the daughter in law on her party shall bear
none other mind unto her mother in law / than if she were her own mother /
by whom she has ^othe gotten more knowledge / and is made better / and has her
husband more pleasant and louy^g unto her. And in a sharp and a rygorous
mother in law all thing chau^seth contrary. As for yt daught^ yt is married /
the mother shall not desire to have so much her own / as wha^ she was a maid
/ but remember / yt than she is skyfted in to another house and kynred / to
e^crease yt stock: but she may counsel her that yt is good / or put her in
remembrance / when she is married / of such cou^sayles as she gave her / wha^
she was unmarried: but she shall not mel with her in such points / as she
thy^keth will displease her son in law. She shall not lead her to churches
/ nor bring her home / nor speak to her / if she think it be again her son
in laws will. Neither let any folysshe woman say to me on this manner: what /
may I not speak to mine own daughter? She is thy daughter in deed / but now
she is not thy woman. For what so ever right thou had to her / thou have
given it over to thy son in law. Therefore and thou love thy daughter / and
would se her happy / that is to say live in co^corde with her husband /
exhort her always / and give her counsel to obey her husband in every point
/ nor let her ones speak with the without he will give her leave. For who so
ever will have more liberty with a man's wife / tha^ ye husband will suffer is
an adulterer. And who so ever touches any thing of an other man's against the
owners will / is a thief. She shall love her son in law none other wise tha^
her own son: but yet she shall reverence hy^ more than her own son. For a
woman ought not to think / that she may be as homely over her son in law / as
her own son: but she shall desire his welfare as much as her own son / and
give him as good counsel and exhortation: but yet in such manner / that she
may seem rather to exhort and require him / than bid and command him.

Of a wife well worn in age. The.xv. Chaptre.
A wife well shot in age / shall do as philosophers say the bird of Egypt
does / which when hit is old / purges all the fylthy humors of hit body
with spices of Araby / and sends forth of hit mouth a wondrous sweet
breath: so a woman / when she is past the pleasure of the body / and has done
with bearyng and bryngyng up of children / than shall she savor and brethe all
heavenly / she shall neither say nor do any thing / that is not full of holiness
/ and that may be example for younger folks to take heed of. Tha^ as Gorgy as
the Rethorycian says / her name shall begin to spryng and be known / when
her person is unknown: than her life / holyly passed before / shall begin to
appear: than in deed a virtuous woman shall rule her husband by obeysaunce /
and shall bring to pass / that her husband shall have her i^ great auctorite
/ which before times has lived ever under her husbands rule. Archyppa / wife
unto Themistocles / by diligent obedience unto her husband / optayned of him
such love / that he again / when he was the most wise and most noble man /
yet followed he his wives mind / almost in every thing: and there of came this
fasfio^ of argument / which in bordes was comen among the greeks: what
someuer this child will / they meant Theophantus Themystocles son / whom the
mother loved tenderly / tha^ argued they thus: What someuer this child will /
the mother will: What so ever ye mother will / Themistocles will: and what so
ever Themistocles will / all the cite of Athens will: and what so ever the cite
of Athens will all greece will. Our lord commanded Abraham / to take heed unto
Saras words / because she was aged / and past the lust of the body. Wherefore
she would not counsel him any childishe thy^g / or that he need to be ashamed
of / by the reason of her wanton body. Therefore when a wife comes unto this
estate / and all her children married / and her self tydde out of wordly
busynes / than let her look to the ground with her body / yeldyng it unto the
ground / but with her mind behold the heaven / whither her mind should
flytte / and lift up all her sensis / her thought / and all her mind unto god
/ and prepare and apply her self holly to her journey / nor think nothing /
but that per tayneth unto her journey / which drawethe toward. But let her
be wise lest in stead of holiness / she fall in superstion / by the reason of
ignorance. Let her be much in holy works: how be it / yet trust more upon
the mercy and the goodness of god / nor trust not on her self / as though by
the reason of her works / she might come thither / as she intends / rather
than by the benyfite and gift of god. And whiles her heart is lustyer than her
body / leave some of her bodily labor / and labor more with her mind. Let
her pray more and more intentyuely: let her think often of god / and more
ferue^tly / fastles / and weary her self less with walkyng about unto
churches. Hit is no need to mynisshe her aged body / and forsake her
norysshyng. Let her do good unto other / by gyuy^g them good counsel. Let her
do them good also with example of her life / of the which commodite a great
part shall return unto her self.

Here ends the second book.
The third book of the instruction of a Christen woman.
Of the mourning of wydowes. The first Chaptre.
A Good Woman when her husband is deed / ought to know / that she has ye
greatteste loss and damage / that can bechaunce her in the world: and that
there is taken from her the heart of mutual and tender love toward her: and that
she has lost not only the one half of her own life (as learned men were
wont to say / when they had lost them / whom they loved derely) but her
self also to be taken from herself all to gether / and perisshed. Of this
cause may come honest weeping / sorrow / and mourning / with good occasion /
and waylynge not to blame. Hit is the greattest token that can be of an hard
heart and an unchaste mind / a woman not to weep for the death of her husband.
How be it there be.ij. kinds of women / which in mourny^g for their
husbands / in contrary ways do both a mys: That is both they that mourn
to much / and those that mourn to lyttel. I have seen some women no more
moved with the death of their husbands / than it had been but one of light
aqueyntance / that had dyed: which was an evident sign of but cold love
unto their husbands. Which thy^g is so foul / that none can be more
abhomynable / nor more cursed. And if a man ask them / why they do so / or
rebuke them / they answer again / the nature of the country so requires.
And ye same excusis lay they for them / that use to put ye cause of their
vices in some planet / or qualitees of the air or earth / where they dwell.
But the nature of the country is cause of no vicis. For than the country
ought to be punysshed / and not ye offensours. We take no vice of the heaven /
or air / but of our own manners. For under every sky is both good living and
ill. Nor there is no country so wretched in the world / that it ne has some
good people there in: nor none so good / but hit has some naught. I have said
here before / that I have seen some / nothing moved with the death of their
husbands. Like wise / I have seen some / that would with a right good will have
quitte their husbands lyfes with their own. Wherefore there is no reason / why
they should lay their fautes in the condition of the Region. For in the
country / that is called Getica / ye air is cold / and yet say the Pomponius
Mela / that the very women lack no stomach to dye on the bodies of their
husbands / and have a special desire to be buried with them. And because chat
the custom is there to mary many women unto one man / there is great stryuyng
among them / which shall have ye praise there in / of them that shall give
the judgment. The victory is given to the most virtuous: and hit is a great
pleasure to them yt may obtain hit. Like wise great learned men write / that
women use to do in Ynde. Also in old time the women of Almayne / from whens
the Flandryns took their original and first beginning / married never but of
maids: and so made an end of all hope and desire of marriage at ones. For they
took one husband as one body and soul / and never desired / nor thought of
marriage after him: as though they loved the matrimony it self / and not the
husbands. Whereby now thou may se / that virtues and manners be changed with
abundance / riches / and pleasures: and the evil fire of riches quenches the
good fire of charity. All the law of Christ sounds noue other thing / but
charity / love / and heat. For our lord says: I am comen to cast fire in to
the earth / and go about nothing so much as to make it to bourne. But when
we couple the rich devil to pour Christ / and unto sobre virtue / revel
and dronkenes / unto chaste sadness desolute and wanton pleasures / pagante and
hethennes unto Christianite / and the devil to god: than god disdaynyng such
fellowship takes his gifts from us / and leaves us the gifts of the devil.
Not withstandyng / it may so chance / that there be in wome^s minds such
constauncy and stedfastnes / that they may comfort them self: and though
they be overcome and opressed / may by wisdom yet recover again. That would
I greatly preyse in a man / but in such a frail kind / hit is no good token
to have so passing great wisdom. I have hard of great wise men / that have
taken very heuyly the death of but light friends / and wept for them
habundantly. Solon / which made the laws of the people of Athens / one of
the.vij. wise men / commanded his own buryall to be kept with wepy^g and
waylynge / that his friends might show / how much they loved him. Also after
that Lucrecia was slain in Rome / when Iunius Brutus / which was reuengeor of
her death and rape / done by the kings son / had driven the kings out of
Rome / and war was made against the king: In the first setting together /
this Brutus was kylde / and ye wives of the cite mourned a twelve month the
death of him / that had be the defender of their chastity. And yet mourned they
/ but an other woman's husband / and because he defended an other womans
chastity. Tha how much more ought thou to mourn the death of him / that is
the defender of thine own chastity / sauer and keeper of thy body / father and
tutour of thy children / welthe of thy house / householde / and thy goods /
yea and more to / thy governor and lord? And thou would weep in deed / if
thou should not depart rycher from him / than thou came to him. But now
the joy of money / takes away all the grefe of thy sorrow. Thou would weep
for his death / if thou had loved him / when he was on live. But now thou
art not sorye for his departing / whom thou set nothing by / wha^ thou
had him. Also many be glad / that their husbands begone / as who were ryd
out of yocke and bondage: and they rejoice that they be out of domynion and
bond / and have recoueredde their liberty: but they be of a folysshe opinion.
For the ship is not at liberte / that lacks a governor / but rather
destitute: neither a child that lacks his tutoure / but rather wandrynge
without order and reason. Nor a woman / when her husband is gone: For tha^ she
is in deed (as she is called) a wydowe / that is to say / desarte and desolate.
Than is she in deed tossed at alue^tures / as a ship / lackynke a master: and is
carried without discression and co^syderatio^ / as a child when his over seer
is out of the way. Here parauenture some would say / He was such an husband
/ that better were to be without him / tha^ to have him. But so would never
good woman say / nor ill keep it in. For if he were of the beloved as the laws
of god do command / he should be / that is to say / as he were thy self:
thou would be as sorye that he should dye / as thy self. Unto an il woman /
except her husband let her have her Itberte to all vices / that her mind
lies to / he is in tolerable. But unto a good woman / no husband can be so
ill / that she ne had leauer have his life than his death. But what should I
speak much of this matter? I have showed enough in ye book a fore / that she
is neither worthy ye name of a good woman nor wife / that can not love her
husband with all her heart / as her self. O circumspecte nature / or rather
god / the most wise master of all good manners. There is no kind of virtue /
but he has created some living thing / that uses it / for to reprehende and
reprove those that dispice that virtue: as bees by their craft reprove ye
leudnes of them / that can nothing do: And ye faithfulness of dogs damneth the
vntrustynes of falls people: sheep condemn frauds and gyles with their
symplenes: stockedoues and turtuls give example of true and faithful love / in
marriage. For those birds / as Aristole says / live content with one male nor
take none other. The turtle dove / when her male is dead / neither drynketh
lyquore / nor sytteth on the grene tree ne comes among none of her fellows
playenge and sportyng together. These chaste and holy loves means Solomon /
wha^ he calls his spouse to him / saying: The voice of a turtle dove is hard
in our realm: And co^pareth his spouse some times to a turtell / and some time
to a stock douue. Also they that can have no measure in their weeping and
mournyng / be as far to blame on the other side. For when they be newly wounded
with the chance / they confound and fill all the place full of cryeng / and
tear their hear / beat their breastis / and skratche their chekes / and
knock their heddes to the walls / and their bodies to the ground / and draw
forth long the time of their mourning / as in Secill / Asia / Greece / and
Rome: in so much / that the senate was feign to make statutes and laws /
which was called the laws of the twelve tables / for to modyfie and appease
the mournyng. And therefore ye apostle also / when he wrote to this people / was
compelled to comfort them / saying: Brethren / I would ye should have
knowledge of those that sleep / that ye be not sorry and pe^syfe / like other
people that have no faith. For if we believe that Jesus is dead / and reuyued
again: so shall god like wise bring again with him all that be dead by him.
Now a wydowe / let her bewail her husband with hearty affection / and not
cry out / nor vex not her self with dasshyng of her hands / neither
beatynge of her body: but let her so mourn / that she remember sobernes and
measure / that other may understand her sorrow / without her own hosty^g and
vtterau^ce. And after that the first bro^te of her sorrow is past and swaged /
than let her begin to study for consolation. Now here will I not bring
forth precepts out of the long volumes of philosophers. For my purpose is to
instruct a Christen woman with Christis philosophy: in co^paryson of whom /
all man's wy sedome is but folly. My mind is to seche a remedy. Let us
remember ye saying of the apostle / that they which sleep with Jesus / shall be
brought of god with Jesus again. Wherefore we ought to be of good comfort. And
she that is a wise woman / let her remember that all men be borne / and live in
this law and condition / to pay their duete unto nature / as their creditoure
/ when so ever she asks it / of some sooner / of some later: how be it all be
coupled with in the common lot and rate / to be borne / and live / and dye: but
our souls be immortal / and this life is but a departing in to a no there
eternal life and blessed / to them that have passed well and virtuously this
temporal and tra^sitory life. The which thing the Christen faith makes
easy enough / not by our desarte and merit / but of his goodness / the which
with his death losed us from the ba^des of death: and death of this life is but
as a sayly^g out of the sea in to ye hauyn. They that dye / go before / and we
shall sone come after: and when we be departed and losed out of this bony /
shall lead our life in heaven unto that time / yt every man shall receive his
own body again: how be hit not so coumberous and heuye as it is now / but
lightly covered and arayde: with it we shall have blessed and ever lasting
life. This is the true and sure christyan consolation / wha^ they that be a
live think and trust / that their fre^des / which are dead / be not separate
from them / but only sent before in to ye place / where with in short space
after they shall mete to gether full merrily / if they will do their diligence /
that they may by the exercise of virtues come thither / as they believe yt they
be gone. These things ought christian prestis to show and tell unto young
wydowes / and comfort their heavy minds with these consolations / and not as
many do drink to them in the funeral feast / and bid them be of good chere /
saying / they shall not lack a new husband / and that he is provided of one
for her all ready / and such other things / as they cast out at ba^kettes and
feastis / wha^ they be well wette with drink.

Of the buryeng of her husband. The.ij. Chaptre.
ALso among many other things / that we use after the example of ye paga^s /
this is one to keep the burial with great sole^nite. For the pagans and
gentiles believed / that if ye body were unburied / the soul should have great
pain in hell / and that the royalty and ceremonies of buryenge should be an
honor both to them and their successors. Not withstanding / there were some
of them / that counted these but fa^tasies and vanitees. For Virgyll in the
person of Anchises / whom he induces for an era^ple of wisdom / says / that
ye loss of sepulture is but a small thy^g. And Lucane in this manner says:

Nature in her quiet lap does all thing receive. He is covered with the sky / yt
has none other grave.

Also wise philosophers / as Diogines / Theodorus / Senec / and Cicero / but in
especial Socrates / did prove by great reasons / that it forsed not where the
carcas became and rotted. Marcus Amilius / which was the chief of the senate
of Rome / commanded his sons alyttell before he departed forth of the world
/ to carry him out on a bear apoy^ted without any shetes or purple / nor should
spe^de upon any other solemnitees beside past.x.s. for he said / the corses of
noblemen were commended by their own noblenes / and not by cost of money.
Valerius Publicola / and Agrippa Menemius / ye one being banissher of the
kings / and restorer of the common liberty / the other broker and arbytrator
of the common peace / and many other mo excellent men / did utterly dispice the
royalte of sepulture: in so much that wha^ they had been in great auctorite
and riches / yet they lafte not behy^de them so much as to hyre an over sear
of ye funeral with. And if they had counted so great goodness in burieng / as
the people supposed / they would sure have seen there unto. Now I will speak
of our martyrs of the Christyan faith / which cared not / where their deed
bodies lay / so yt the souls fared well. For Christ / what time he shall
restore the souls to ye bodies / shall easily find in his house / which he
knows well enough / the least ashes of the body. Saint Augustyne in the book
that he named ye Cite of god / in the first says: All these busynes / as
keeping of the corce / and order of the sepulture / and royalties of the
funeral / be rather the consolations of them that live / than any ease to ye
deed. For if solemn buryeng might help an iuyll man any thing / than should
pour buryeng orels none at all / hyndre a good man: but we se far contrary /
nor ye great royalte of sepulture did not ease the pain of the rich man /
spoken of in the gospel: nor hit was no rebuke to the lazer man / that his
body lay on the earth abiecte and naught set by. For after ward the rich man
was punysshed in hell for his ill living / and the lazer was refresshed in the
lap of Abraham / and had his reward for his life innoce^tly and virtuously
spente. Neither I would not yt sepulture should be put away. For holy fathers
/ as Abraham / Isac / and Jacob / and Iosephe / when they dyed / commanded
much of their buryeng. And Tobias was preysed of ye angel of god / because he
had burted deed people. But all the orname^tes of sepultures ought to go to the
profet of them that be deed / and not to them that live. For he that is deed
must make his rekeny^ge to god only / which reioyseth of ye merits of them
that be deed / done before in their lives / and of the clean and pure minds of
them that be alive. There is no show of riches nor pride pleasant to him / but
holle trust and hope in him / and charity with thyn eue^ Christen. For if thou
give almys / thou shalt have almys: and if thou be merciful / thou shalt
receive mercy. Therefore make friends to thy self and to thy lovers / that are
deed / with thy worldly treasure / that thou may find in the other life
them that shall receive the in to eternal herborowe. For our lord in the
gospel gives paradise to them / that gives the works of mercy: and denies
hit to them / that deny the works of mercy. Also he teaches the ways of
gyuyng alms / that thou give none of thy goods to them that be of great
habylyte / and may quyte the / or do a better turn for ye again: but give
to pour folks and beggars / that be not able to do as much for the again:
and so thou shalt have great reward of god. Thanne how much is hit better
to cloth pour strangers / than thy rich kynsfolkes / and pour lay men / than
rich prestis: and that that is spe^ded on wax and costly sepultures / to be
bestowed on pour wydowes / and fatherles children / and such as lack? And
much surer and more plentuous advantage shall comme hereof. And in the day of
thy weping / thou shalt remember them that ever weep / being opressed with
necessite: their tears shall follow thyn: their mirthe shall chere the. Thy
friend that is deed shall find them atournees and advocates / most pleasant
to the judge eteruall / to plead his matter / and be as dilligent in his peril
as in their own. Now it appears well enough / what I judge of those wydowes
/ that disceyue their creditours of their payment / to bring forth their
husbands royally / orels do not accomplysshe and perform the will and
bequestis of ye deed man / which thing ought to be done specially. I need not
to declare here / how much men be bound to the payeng of their dettes / nor
how much the fulfyllyng of testame^tes ought to be regarded. For ye true and
durable honor of the corce stands in men's hearts / and not in the pomp of
sepulture / or tombs of marble and metal / costly wrought. For men say well
by the buryeng of a good man / be it never so pour: and pray for him / and
curse sumptuous tombs / and that the more spitously / if the money be ill
gotten / that it was made with.

Of the myndyng of her husband. The.iij. Chaptre.
LEt a wydowe remember / and have still before her eyes in her mind / that our
souls do not perisshe together with the body / but be losed of the bonds of
our corporal grocenes / and be lyghtned from the burden of the body / and that
death is nothing / but a separation of ye soul from the body / and that the
soul departs not so from the body in to an other life / that it clearly
gives over our matters here in this world / and they have been often times
hard of them that were on live / and they know much of our actis and fore
times by the showing of angels / that go between. Wherefore a good wydowe ought
to suppose / that her husband is not utterly dead / but lives / both with
life of his soul / which is the very life / and beside with her remembrance.
For our friends live with us / though they be absente from us or dead / if
the lively image of them be imprinted in our hearts / with often thynkyng upon
them / and daily renewed / and their life ever wax fresshe in our minds. And
if we forgette them / than they dye toward us. The brethren of Valeria
Messalina / that was Sulpicius wife / asked her after her husbands death
(because she was yet in the flowers of her youth / and helthfull of body / and
thereto goodly of beauty) whether she would marye again: Nay verily said she:
for Sulpicius is still alive to me. And this was ye saying of a pagane / not
assured of the eternal life. Than what should a christen woman do? Let her
keep the rememraunce of her husband with reverence / and not with weeping: and
let her take for a solemn and a great oath / to swire by her husbands soul
/ and let her live and do so / as she shall think to please her husband /
being now no man but a spirit purified / and a divine thing. Also let her
take him for her keeper and spy / not only of her deeds / but also of her
conscience. Let her handell so her house and householde / and so bring up her
children / that her husband may be glad / and think that he is happy to leave
such a wife behy^de him. And let her not behave her self so / that his soul
have cause to be angry with her / and take vengeance on her ungraciousness.
Cyrus the elder king of Perse / when he dyed as Xenophon writes / commanded
his sons to keep his memory with devotion and pureness / for cause of the
honor of the god immortal / and the worship and the immortalite of his soul.
Let ye wydowe make an end of wepy^g / lest we should seem to mourn for our
folks / that are departed / as though we counted them clean deed / and not
absent.

Of the chastity and honesty of a wydowe. The.iiij. Chaptre.
IN gyuyng instruction to a christen woman / whom may a man do better after /
than saint Paul / that said / he was all thing to al men? to thentent that he
might win them to Christ: also puts in his own laudie and praise the
busyues of all churches: so he / writy^ng to the Corinthies / says on this
manner: Let syngle folks apply them self to the busynes of our lord / how
they may please him: and let married folks take heed of worldly matters / how
they may please and content their spouses. For hit is convenient / that the
wife be all at her husbands will / and that a syngle woman give her self
hollye to Jesus Christ / which is spouse of all good and virtuous woman.
Therefore tha^ let pass all that try^myng and arayeng of her body / which when
her husband lived / might seem to be done for his pleasure: but when he is
deed / all her life and all her apparel must be disposed and ordered after
his will / that is successor unto her husband / that is immortal god unto
mortal man. Therefore must only the mind be pyked and made gaye: for that only
is it that Christ marieth / and in the which Christ rests and deliteth.
But those that inte^de to mary / tire and tryme up them self / and that that I
have said before of maids / may be applied to this place: yet much less is
becomynge for a wydowe to garnisshe up and paynte her self: which should not
only seek for no bargayne / but rather refuse them offered: neither take any
offers / but fore against her will / and compelled to the second marriage / if
she be a good woman. How be hit in a maid goodly arayment may be more
suffered / but in a wydowe it is to be disco^me^ded. For what body would not
abhorte her / that after her first husbands death / shows her self to
long after an other / and casts away her spouse Christ / and marieth the
devil first / and fynst man / being both wydowe / wife / and adulterar? But
they have both a more easy state and condition / and more over better / that
show their wydo wheed in their clot hynge / and behauyng of their body and
manners. For they that be never so ungracious / yet have a favor to them that
be good and honest: and by such tokens as they se in them / cast / if they
should marie with them / and chance to die before them / what manner of wydowe
they should leave behind them. For Iensure you / there is no husband / that
would not have his death mourned of his wife / and be him self desired of her
/ and myssed: and seeing that we have such precepts for married folks / both
of philosophers / and the apostles / what should we think that their judgment
was of wydowes? By whom the apostle Paul writes to Timothy on this manner: A
very wydowe and desolate woman trusts in god / and is in prayer day and night
/ and she that is delicate and easefull / is deed / ye being on live. Therefore
bid them keep them from blame. For they seem to live in the sight of those that
se them eat and drink / and go / and speak / and do other works of life.
But and one could perse with his sight in to them / or enter with in ye
secrets of their minds and thoughts / he should se that pour sinful soul
/ how it is put from god / and spoiled and deprived of his life. Thus saint
Paul says / Thus saint Hieronyme / Thus saint Ambrose / Thus saint Augustyne
/ Thus al saints and holy men / with one voice and opinion say / That weeping
/ and mournyng / solytarines / and fasting / be the most precious doures and
orname^tes of a wydowe. Moreover / what feast is / what plays and daunces a
wydowe should use / saint Paul does show / when he byddeth her be in prayer
day and night: and so when her mortal husband is deed / she might be at more
lyberte with the immortal / and more by leisure / and ofter talk with him /
and more pleasantlye / yea and to say more plainly / a wydowe ought to pray
more inte^tyfely and ofter / and fast longer / and be much at mass and
preaching / and read more effectually / and occupy her self in ye
conte^plation of those things / that may mende her living and manners. Anna /
the daughter of Phanuell / commen of the tribe of Aser / which lived with her
husband seven year after her marriage / and when she had been wydowe fourscore
year and four / our lord Christ found her in the temple / out of the which
she had never departed / but ever in fasting and prayer day and night. And in
deed I would have greatter virtue and perfection in a wydowe / than in a wife.
For ye wife must apply her self to the will of her mortal husband / to whom
she is married / but ye wydowe has taken Christ to her husband immortal.
Wherefore it is reason / that all thing be more excellent and according for
such a spouse / and words more sad and sober. For the communycation of
every body is lightly a glass and a myrrour of the mind / and conditions of
them. For hit is an old proverb: Suthe as the life is / such is the
communication. And foul and unclean speech hurts the mind. Ill speech
corrupts good conditions / as saint Paul says. After the words of ye poet
Menander / I would that a wydowe should not only speak such words / as might
show her self chaste and honest / but also that might instrucre the herars
with lernyng / and amend them with example of her living. For mankind has
speech to couple wisdom and virtue to gether: and though it seem to do no
more but utter the thought of the mind / yet does it cause both learning and
virtue. And though a woman be losed out of the ba^des of worldly matrimony /
let her yet not thy^ke that she may do what her lust. For often times wydowes
do show / what they have been in marriage / and under the liberty of
wydoweheed / open and show that which they kept in before for fear of their
husbands. As birds / when they be out of their cagis / by and by turn to
their old conditions: Like wise many women show out at ones the vices that
they dissembled (so as they could while that their husbands lived) after that
the lettes that they had of their husbands be taken away. For than shall hit
be known / what nature or condition a woman is of / when she may do what she
will. And as saint Hieronyme says / she is chaste in deed / that may do iuell
and she list / and will not. Therefore a woman had need to work more warely /
when both the disprayse of vices and ye praise of virtue is imputed to her
self. For as long as her husband lived / he had a great part of both. In
the wydowheed Christ her spouse will lightly help her that will live
vertuouslye. And if we do any thing well / we ought to thank him therefore: and
if we do ill / it is to be referred to our self. And as a man has all his
joy in his wife / if she be good / in like wise no man can believe how
pleasant and amiable she is to Christ / that plays the wydowe in deed / that
is to say / the which being desolate in this life / has all her hope and
trust / and all her joy and delight in Christ. And such saint Paul
commands to the bysshoppes to have in regard: for by their prayer the
church optayneth many things of Christ. For such a one deserved to se
Christ first in the temple / and to prophecy of him to them that were
present. Such a wydowe is praised by the mouth of god / and is commended to
us in this commandment in the.C.xxx. psalm / where our lord says: I shall
bless this wydowe. And in ye prophet Esai: Thou shalt not hurt a wydowe / or
a child that is under age. For if thou hurt them / they shall cry to me /
and I shall here their cryenge / and shall be displeased / and strycke ye with my
sword / and your wynes shall be wydowes / and your children fatherles.

How they shall use themself at home. The.v. Chaptre.
Not withstanding that holy men would wydowes should be often in the church /
and still in prayer / yet they did not utterly forbid them worldly busynes. For
saint Paul says of wydowes / writing unto Tymothe: If any widow have
chidren / or childre^s children / let her first learn to handle her own house
virtuously / and do for her progenitors again. Let the wydowe teach this /
let the children learn this / that is to behave them self lowly and louyngly
to their fathers and mothers / graundfathers and graundmothers. For we se hit
chaunseth often times / that they that be brought up with a wydowe / by the
means of her over much sufferaunce and cherysshynge / be stobborne and
inobedient to them / whom they should obey: in so much that in some countries
/ and inespeciall in mine / hit is used in a common proverb / to call them
wydowes kocneis / that be ill brought up children / and that be self wild and
unthrifty young men. Therefore I would counsel a young woman / being a wydowe
/ to put the bryngyng up of her children unto some good and sad man. For she is
so blinded with the love of them / that she thinks she deals hardly with
them / when she makes of them most How be it some has be great wise women /
and has brought up their children both very well and wisely: As Cornelia / yt
brought up Gracchus her son: and Veturia / which brought up Martius Coriliane:
in so much / that what noble act so ever he did in the common welthe / either
at home or from home / he was ever incited with this thing / that he might do
so / that it might be alowable to his mother / yt had brought him up. But how
children should be brought up? I have taught in the book before. Therefore let
the wydowe look there / whatsoever makes for this purpose. And as for their
householde / ye appostle aforesaid / wrytethe of hit. If any wydowe do not se
to her own friends specially / she denies her faith / and is worse than an
infidel. Yet lest she be to homely / to put her self in press / in company
of her servants / namely if she be yo^ge / let her here what saint Hieronyme
says / writing unto Saluina. Chastity says he / in women is a brytyll thing /
and like a goodly flower wyddereth and dries with a little wether / and a
small blaste: and namely if the age be apt to vice / and the aucthorite of the
husband lacking / whose spirit is the defender of the wife. What should a
wydowe do among a great noumbre of men servants / which I would not she
should set at naught / as bondmen / but abasshe and regard as me^. How be it
/ if she have a great house / yt requires much man's service / let her make
some well aged man ruler / that is sad and discrete / and of good conditions /
whose honesty shall be his maistres worship. For I have known many that have
shut up their doors / and have not comen abroad / and yet have had an ill
name with their own servants / whom over gorgious aperell of ye servant has
caused to be suspected / orels ye welfare and good lykyng of his body / or age
apt for pleasure / or pride / or high my^de / by the reason yt he knew he was
loved of his maystres: which love / though hit be well hyd / yet many times
hit appears / when he dispiseth his fellows / as they were his bondmen. These
be the words of saint Hieronyme: unto the which I add this more over / That
best is for a wydowe to mynysshe her householde / in especial of me^ / and to
take unto her some well aged woman / wise and virtuous / with whom she may
lead her life: and ask counsel of her in such matters as pertayne to
women. And if she be aged her self / let her take to her some old man / that
is some kynsman of hers / or of her alyaunce / whom she may trust unto. And
finally / let her ever use the counsel of that man / that she knows has
good wit / and would her profet / and is trusty. The old Romans would /
that the women should ever be under the rule of their fathers / and brethren /
and husbands / and kynsme^. Let her dwell rather with her mother in law / or
her husbands alyaunce and kynsfolkes / thanne with her own / both for the
remembrance of her husband / for whose sake hit may appear / that she loves
better his kyn and his blood / than her own. And in as much as she is
translated in to that kynred / unto the which she has borne children / or at
the least wise should have done. More over / ye discipline of chastity is
rekened more strayte among alyance / tha^ kynsfolkes: because there is less
cherisshyng and liberty. But a virtuous woman will not be so much moved with
all these things / as with the remembrance and love of her husband. For so
Antonia / daughter unto Marcus Antonius the judge / wife unto Drusus / led
all her life with her mother in law. Like wise Liuia left her house and her
country to dwell with her mother i^lawe Noemy. Except there be with her mother
in law some nyce and wanton young men / yt may cause a blotte in her good
name / or put her chastity in ieoperdye: or except the women that be her
alyans / be not of all the best fame: for than it is more wisdom to go to
her own kynsfolkes.

How they shall behave them self forth. The.vj. Chapter.
OTher whiles they shall have causes to go abroad. Therefore let them go
covered / and show in deed / what their name means. For ye name of a wydowe
in Greek and Latin / is as much to say / as desolate and destitute. Wherefore
there is much difference between one going alone / and companied with men. And
seeing that so great sadness of behauour and arayment is required in a wife /
than what ought to be co^sydered in a wydowe? She ought to show example unto
other / both of chastity / sobernes / and honestye. And seeing that they ought
to give example to other / how can it do well / that they should go forth
appoy^ted in ye armor of the devil / both to show the pomp and vanite of
their own mind / and set the snares of Satanas in stead of the example of
Christ? Wherefore saint Ambrose says full well / that with mournyng garments /
and sad and demure lokes / wanton and nyce lokes be kept under / and unlawful
lusts quenched. The surest is not to go much abroad: and wha^ she goth / to
be companied with some good and sad woman. Let her seche to no churches / where
as is reforte / but where as no body is / and where none occasions is of
trespassyng / and good quietness and occasyon of prayeng. Let her not keep much
company with freris and prestis. For the devil is craftye / and by long use
has learned by what craft every body may be over comyne. And if he have
oportunyte / he will sone bring his purpose to pass: for he has none other
thing to occupy him self with. If a wydowe would ask any counsel / let
her chose some aged man / that is paste the lust of the world / nor is
infected with any vices nor is set upon covetousness / nor will set his my^de on
flatery for hope of va^tage of lucre of money / and that is well learned / by
much experience has gathered great wisdom / that he neither keep her mind
strayter tha^ need is / nor let her have over much the bridle of liberty /
nor does count nothing more precious nor dear than troth and virtue: let
her / what so ever she douteth show to him / and be aknowe^ to none other
body. Saint Hieronyme writes to Eustachium / and gives her such manner
counsel. If thou doubt any thing of scripture / or be ignorant in it / ask
of him that is commendable of lyuy^g / and for his age excusable nor has any
evil name / and that may say / I have disposed the to one man to yield a
chaste virgin unto Christ. And if there be none that can expound and declare
thy doutes / it is better to be ignorant safely / tha^ to know with ieoperdye.
For in courts and i^ resort of me^ / and gatheryng of people / a wydowe
should not meddle. In ye which places there is great ieoperdy of those things
/ that a wydowe ought to set most by. And a wydowe / ye is chaste / honest /
of good fame / and virtuous ought to do so / yt she may do good / not only to
her self / but also to other folks. A broad / and before many men's eyes and
handlynges / shainfastnes by little and little gothe away / and honesty and
chastity comes in ieoperdye: and though they be not over comen / yet they be
sore assailed. And as for the ouerco^myng every man will say / not as the thing
is in deed / but as he lusts. More over / the cares of this world cowle the
love and desire of heavenly things: and as our lord says in the gospel / The
sede falls among thorns / that is choked with thoughts and busynes of this
present life: neither is suffered to grow up to good corn: And like wise as a
see / that the wind has lain sore upon / is yet tossed and troubled / after
that the wind is laid / and ye tempest gone: so man's mind lately come^ out
of busynes of ye world / yet casts i^ his my^de and study ye same things /
and pa^teth after his labor: nor can not aft his trouble come straight to it
self. And wha^ the my^de is troubled / what manner of prayers can be said?
verily as you may se / careful and unquiet sauorynge of the mire and dyrte of
this peuysshe world: like as when a river or fou^tayne is troubled a man can
draw no water but full of mudde. The quietness of mind is that that lyfteth us
up highest unto ye speech of god / as it did mary Maudsene / which all man's
and worldely busynes given over / satte at the feet of our lord diligently
herynge his word. Therefore is she commended by the testymony of Christ / that
she had chose^ the best party / ye which should not be taken from her. But
here would some say / My lands be in peril / I am sued. Unto that / here the
saying of saint Ambrose. Do not complain / yt thou art alone: For chastity
requires solytarines: and a chaste woman desires secretnes. But you have
matters and busynes / and fear ye attourne of thyn adversary / plea dyng
before ye judge. But our lord entreats for ye saying: Give judgment for the
fatherles child / and justify the wydowe. But yet thou would keep thy^
heritage. The heritage of chastity is far gretter: ye which a wydowe ought
better to keep tha^ a wife. And if thy servant offend / forgive him. For it is
better ye you forbear an others fault / than utter thyn own. Thus says saint
Ambrose. Also I would you should understand / ye my mind is to have her
matter the most tendered of the judges / that has but feeble attournes / or
none at all. For than shall the judges take on them the room of attourneis /
when they withstand often times mighty defenders and advocates. For naturally
we hate them that have great power and riches / and help them that have
little / and go about to put down them that exalte them self / and to help
up them / that be humble and lowely. Also it is ordained of nature / that in
men's opinions / as ye wise man says / in all manner of stryfes the greatter
shall seem to do ye wrong / yea though he have it done to him / because he
may do more. And the same that I have said of judges / understand me to have
spoken of attourneis. Unto whom / al ye wydowes matter shall be more credible /
whom they se over shamfast to defend her own quarrel: and her matter shall be
so much more recommended unto them / the less that she recommendeth it. And
her cause shall be more like to be good / whom me^ thy^ke so good and virtuous /
that she will neither ask nor hold that is not her own. So a good woman
shall not bring with her to the court arguments of pleaders in ye law / but
the auctorite of record. And she that is bablyng / and busye / and troublous /
must needs wereye men / and make them to loathe her / and hyndreth her of ye
socour that I spoke of. And this I have said by good judges and advocates / or
at ye least such as she knows not to be ill. For some be so nyce and wanton
/ that they will sell their counsel and iugementes for their unthrifty
pleasure of their body. Upon whom doutles the common good order and manner would
take punysshement / saving that the laws / as ye wise man said / be like the
coppe webbes / that take all littell beastis / and let the great alone. But a
good wydowe / if she know ye they be such / as she may well enough by their
name that they have of the people / she shall eschew them and fle / not only
with the loss of her goods / but also ieoperdie of her self / if need were.
And the same I would she should do by all that be wanton and vicious. Now of
runnyng about to other men's houses / saint Paul has a precepte / that those
wydowes ought to be abiecte / as mysfamous / that rounne ydell from house to
house: and not only idell / but also be babblars and full of words / where as
is not convenient. For there be some / which when they think their self they
have done all their own busynes / than without shame they meddle with other
folks business / and give counsel / as though they were great sages / and
exhort and give precepts / rebuke and correct / pyke fautes / and be
wondrous quick of sight from home / and at home blind enough.

Of second marriages. The.vij. Chaptre.
NOr to condemn and reprove utterly second marriages / it were a point of
heresye. How be it that better is to absteyne tha^ marye again / is not only
counsayled by Christyane pureness / that is to say by divine wisdom / but
also by pagans / yt is to say / by worldly wisdom. Cornelius Tacitus / as I
have rehearsed / says / ye women of Almayne were not wont to marie but of
maids: and though they were wydowes in their youth / yet would they not
marye again / and specially the noble women. Valeria / sister un to Messala /
and Portia the yo^ger daughter of Cato / when there was praised unto her / for
her good nes / a woman that had betwyse married / Portia answered / An happy and
a chaste dame would never marye oftener than ones. Cornelia / the mother of
Caius and Titus Gracchus / when she was moved with great promises by Ptolome ye
king of Egypt / to marye again / she refused / and had leauer be called
Cornelia Gracchus wife / than the queen of Egipte. Also second mariagis were
rebuked in plays and enterludes / and verses of poets in this manner: Often
maryeng can not be without occasion of reprehe^sio^: And a woman yt marieth
many / can not please many. Not wtsta^dyng wydowes lay many causes / wherefore
they say they must marie agay^e: of whom saint Hieronyme speaks in this manner
/ writy^g unto ye holy woman Furia. Yo^ge widows / of whom there has many
gone bacwarde after ye devil / after yt they have had their pleasure by maryeng
in Christ / be wo^te to say / My goods spille^ daily / ye heritage of mine
auncetry perissheth / my servants speak stubbournely and p^sumtuously / my
maid will not do my commandment / who shall go before me forth? Who shall
answer for my house re^te? Who shall teach my yo^ge sons? Who shall bring
up my yo^ge daughters? And so they lay yt for a cause to marye fore / which
should rather let them from it. For she bry^geth upon her children an enemy /
and not a norisher: not a father / but a tyra^ne. And she inflamed with vicious
lust / forgets her own womb: and she yt late before sat mourny^g among her
children / that perceive not their own loss and harms / now is pyked up a
new wife. Where to layest thou ye cause in thine enheryta^ce / and pride of thy
servants? confess thyn own viciousnes. For none of you takes a husband
but to ye intent yt she will lie with him / nor except her lust prick her. What
a ragiousnes is it / to set thy chastity common like an harlotte / yt you may
gether riches? And for a vile / and a thy^g yt shall sone pass away / to fyle
thy chastity / yt is a thy^g most precious and euerlasty^g. If you have children
already / what nedest you to marie? If you have none / why do you not fear ye
bare^nes / yt thou have proved before: and aue^terest upon a^ uncertain thy^g /
and forgost thyn honesty and chastity / yt you wast sure of. Now you have
writy^g of spousage made ye / yt within short while after / thou may be
compelled to write a testament. The husband shall feyne him self sick / and
shall do on live and in good health / yt he would have to do wha^ you shall die.
And if it chance yt thou have children by thy second husband / tha^ ryseth
strife and debate at home with i^ thy house. Thou shalt not be at liberty to
love thine own children equally / neither to look indifferently upon them / yt
you haste borne: you shall reach them meat secretly: he will e^uie him yt is deed
/ and except you hate thyn own children / you shall seem to love their father
yet. And if he have children by a another wife / tha^ shall players and gesters
rail and gest upon ye / as a cruel stepdame. If thy stepson be sick / or his
heed ache / you shalt be diffamed for a witch: and if you give him not meat /
you shall be accused of cruelte: and if you give any / you shall be called a
poysoner. What I pray yt / has second marriages so pleasant / yt ca^ be able
to reco^pe^ce these euylles? Thus says saint Hieronyme. As for the preyse of
co^tyne^ce and chastity / and cou^sailyng from second marriages / what ca^ I be
able to say after ye eloque^t fositayne of saint Hieronyme / or yt sweet
dilicates of saint Ambrose speech? Therefore who so desires to know any thing
of those matters / let him look it of them. For it longs not to my purpose /
to recite al their sayenges here. For I do not i^te^de to write exortatio^s
unto any ky^de of living / but to give rules / how they may live. Never ye
less / I would counsel a good woman to continue in holy wydowhed / namely if
she have children: which thing is ye intent and fruit of matrimonye. But and
she dout / lest she can not avoid ye pricks of nature with yt life / let her
give an ear unto saint Paul thayo stel / writy^g unto ye Corinthies i^ this
wife: I say to unmarried women and wydowes / it were good for them / if they
kept them self as I am: but yet if they ca^ not suffer / let them marie. For
it is best to marie tha^ bourne. And ye same apostle writes unto Timothe thus:
Put away yo^ge wydowes / for when they have abused them self at large / than
would they mary to Christ / and are condemned because they have refused their
first promise / and walk idle from house to house / neither only idle / but
tryfly^g and bablyng / praty^g and talkyng / such things as be comes not.
Therefore I would yt ye yo^ger should marie / and bry^g forth children / and rule
their house / and give their enmy none occasion to say il by them. For there be
some / which straight after their conversion have followed Satanas. Yet let them
beware / yt they do it not by and by aft their husbands death. For yt is a
toke^ yt they loved not them for whose deperting they have so sone left
sorowyng / mournyng / and al desire of them. And if they must provide ought for
their house or children / let them se to hit before the busynes of marriage and
dominion of a new husband. And let them get such husbands as be
according for wydowes to be married unto / nor young men / wanton / hot / and
full of play / ignorante / and riotous / that can neither rule their house /
nor their wife / ne their self neither: but take an husband some thing past
mydle age / sober / sad / and of good wit / expert with great use of the
world: which with his wisdom may keep all the house in good order: which by
his discretion may so temper and govern all thing / that there may be always
at home sober myrthe and obedience / without frowardnes / and ye house hold
kept in their labor and ductye / without pain / and all thing clear and
holle. And let them were and know / that these contents him / whose
pleasure only they shall all more esteem / thanne the holle countries beside

Here ends the book called thinstruction of a Christen woman / which who so
shall read / shall have much / both knowledge / pleasure / and fruit by it.
