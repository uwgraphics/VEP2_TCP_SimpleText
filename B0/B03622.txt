Fancies Favorite: OR, The Mirror of the Times.
Being a young Ladies commendation of a young Gallant, which has a long time
showed her much love; which by his civil carriage, and long patience in waiting
on her, at last conquered her, who was once resolved to lead a single life, and
therefore he termed her the Phoenix of the Times.

To the Tune of, Fancies Phoenix.




COme, come, away you Maidens fair
this Song to you I will indite,
It Is of a Young Man I Will declare.
who in his praise I needs must write:
The City if I search about,
I scarce shall find his fellow out.
He has been constant now to me,
The mirror of the times is he.
I must confess, I once did mind,
a single life to live and dye;
But such rare parts in him I find,
his civil Suit I cannot deny,
But am resolved to set him free,
And grant him love and liberty:
So civil he has been to me, etc.
I once did think I never should
so much as know what love should be,
Nor did I dream he ever could
with patience so have conquered me:
His comely gesture I did spy
Made me delight in's company.
That all may say that does him see, etc.
Did you ever see that glorious Star
that ushers in the morning bright,
How he exceeds all other far
by casting forth his sparkling light,
So all do say as much by he,
That ever did keep his company.
His carriage does his gesture show,
he is admired where-e'r he go.
He bashful is, yet bold also,
and shows it with a gallant grace,
All vaporing Blades he scorns to know,
yet scorns he for to hide his face,
He Will take no wrong, nor quarrels breed,
but stick to's friend in time of need:
He Is civil, yet he will merry be, etc.
If any where you should him spy,
in Maids or Women's company,
No wanton looks comes from his eye,
at any time as you ever shall see,
He Will court, he will kiss, he will sing or play,
but it shall be in a modest way,
For Men or Women's company, etc.


But stay, my Pen does run too fast,
in setting forth his gallantrie,
For Fear I lose him at the last,
then cause you will have to laugh at me,
When some do hear of him they may
persuade his love from me away:
But if they gain his love from me,
None constant then I think there be.
But his name I have not told,
nor will not yet, you may be sure
Till of him I can get faster hold,
there is no one here shall it procure.
You Maidens all that hear my Song,
I would not have you for him long.
But if you do, persuaded be,
You may find some as good as he.
A Phoenix he has termed me,
because I thought to lie alone,
But if that such a Bird there be,
out of this Climate sure she is flown,
Our Land is cold, and therefore I,
resolve no Phoenix for to die.
But though I don't his Phoenix prove,
Yet I will be his Turtle Dove.
There Is many maiden that does say,
a single life is best at ease,
How often I peay will you say nay,
if once a Young man does you please,
I must confess sometimes you will prove,
most coy to him you most do love.
What by experience I find true,
Pray blame not me to tell it you.
Let me advise you Maidens fair,
not to be coy, nor proud at all,
For those that count themselves most rare
most times does get the greatest fall:
You seldom see a scornful maid,
but at the last she is betrayed:
Be courteous, yet be virtuous still,
And let not young men have their will.
Choose not a Husband for estate,
unless you fancy him beside,
You may repent when it is too late,
it is for a life time you are tied:
No Ranter take, if you be wise,
nor yet none of the new precise:
The one will rant and spend thy means,
The other closely may love queans.
But now my Song grows to an end,
I must be gone, my love does stay,
Last night I did unto him send
to meet me at a place to day;
Where we intend so to agree,
in what Church we will Married be:
Then Phoenix like we'll live and dye
In the pure flames of Chastity.
One Love, one Faith, we do express,
and therefore we one name will have,
Our love so great is I confess,
we likewise do desire one grave;
To his desire I will incline,
his ashes shall be joined with mine,
So Phoenix like we mean to lie,
And Turtle like we'll live and dye.
