portrait of Queen Elizabeth I holding scepter and orb

Lo here the pearl,
Whom God and man does love:
Lo here on earth,
the only star of light:
Lo here the Queen,
Whom no mishap can move:
To change her mind,
from virtues chief delight:
Lo here the heart,
that so has honored God:
That for her love,
We fell not of his rod:
Pray for her health,
such as good subjects be:
(Oh Princely Dame,)
there is none like to thee.
