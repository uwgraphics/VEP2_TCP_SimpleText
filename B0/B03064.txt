make good only 7000. li. of those Talleys which are due from His Majesty to
Sir Thomas Dawes; Which if the Honorable House shall think fit to do, either
out of the Revenue, or some other way, the Lady Dawes will have no cause to
complain for relinquishing her Joyntures, Master John Dawes discharge the Lands
from his Statute, and the Creditors be enabled to sell the said Lands again to
any purchaser, which diverse of them must be enforced to do (though to their
great loss) to satisfy those moneys which they took up at 8. li. per Centum,
to supply the then urgent affairs of the Commonwealth.
