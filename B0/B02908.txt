decorative border with skull and crossbones, skeletons, etc.
ON THE DEATH OF SIR DAVID FALCONER OF NEWTON, Lord President of the Council
and Session.
NOt to disparage other Hero's praise,
Whose Temples have been wreathed with Themis Bays:
In this our Age we truly may averr,
None lived more loved, then worthy Falconer.
The Bar declared him Learned and Eloquent,
The Bench a Grave Judicious President.
His Parents, Children, and good Lady, prove
His great Obedience, Piety, and Love.
His Life (ah! short) was from his tender Youth;
All Diligence, Integrity, and Truth.
Nothing could him from equity withdraw.
Law's a dumb Judge, he was a speaking Law,
And could no more from that just Rule decline,
Than Sol can stray from the Ecliptic Line.
R. D.
