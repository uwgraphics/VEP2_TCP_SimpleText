Cuckoldom Alamode, or A Comical Relation, of an Eminent Tallow-Chandler, who
sneaked off last Week with an Ale-Drapers Wife, near Gray's Inn. With the
Tallow-Chandlers Wife's Lamentation for the loss of her Husband, and the
Ale-Drapers sorrow for the absence of his Wife.
To which is added, the Leicestershire Cobbler's misfortune, or a Hue and Cry
after a lost Maiden Head, in Bell-Yard, near Sheare-Lane, with other pleasant
Particulars.
AN Eminent Tallow-Chandler, (it being a slippery Trade) lived very lately near
Red-Lyon Square, why though he had a Handsome Wife of his own, would needs be
handling of other Folks, Folk, and among the rest, a Young Woman near
Gray's Inn, but it being near the I a vyers apparments, I think it my Duty to
clear up the matter so far as to tell my Readers she was none of their Wives,
(though some of them are wanton enough) but a certain Ale-Drapers Wife, whose
Charming features so far he witen'd the Headstrong Tallow-Chandler, that he
could not be contented to go half Snacks with the Ale-Draper, but was so
unreasonable, as to play at Sweep Stakes with him, and in order to bring his
unlawful project to Effect, he for several Weeks last post, frequented the
Derb, Merchants House, who being one of those contented Christian, who lays
claim to Heaven by their Wives Transgressions; gave the Tallow-Chandler all the
Freedom Imaginable; who Improved the opportunity to that degree, that he
prevailed with his Wife to leave her Husbands Tapp, and wholly take her self to
his Candle Mould: The Innocent Husband, though he was partly Sencible the
Tallow-Chandler Traded with his Wife by Retail, yet he did not Dream in the
least, he would take her by the Lump; but though it is too true, yet contrary to
the Proverb, we have made bold to make a Jest on it, and you may take my word
for it, (if you will not be at the pains to go to see) that they went both away
together last Week and neither of 'em empty Handed. The Tallow-Chandler (as I
am Informed,) having took a considerable ^umm of Money with him, and the
Ale-Drapers Wife has Ea^^d her Husband of a great many of hi^ best movables,
except his own Tool which she did not like, leaving her Husband, who was before
a mild and contented Man; (but now a Horn Mad Cuckold) fretting and raving in
such a sad and deplorable manner, that 'ewould grieve a Bodies Heart to hear
his Sighs and Lamentations, though to do him justice, it is not so much for the
loss of his Wife, as the discovery of His Horns, which till then he kept
Incognito, and that which agravates his misfortune, he hears that they are on
their way to Ireland, so that he is like to bid adieu to his light Heel'd Wife.
And the Tallow-Chandlers Wife to her wanton and Lascivious Husband, he having
left her several small Children.

The Leicestershire Cobbler's misfortune.
A Certain Cobbler, alias Translator of Shoots, of the First and Second
Edition, keeping a large Bulk, near Bell Yard, by Sheer Lane; and having often
been a deridder and scoffer at other Men's misfortunes, especially Female
Encumbrances; had the evil Fortune himself to fall into the like Inconveniency,
for lately Trading between the two Hams, for an Invisible thing called a Maiden
Head, and having by the use of his Awl, and other Dexterous and Natural
Ingenuity deprived the right owner of it; and being not able to make
restitution; the careless looser Mrs. Abigal-Wagtail, who now lives at the
Stool of Repentance, came last Week to his renowned Stall, where she produced
the Fruits of his Labor as a Testimony against him affirming that he was the
Man who rifled her Copyhold, and consequently had Robbed her of that Treasure,
which he was not able to restore; the Cobbler at first was in great
consternation, looking as White as a Clout; to see such unwelcome vissiters but
seeing there was no way to avoid keeping the Battling: He told his Neighbors
that it was in vain to deny the matter since she produced his Hand and Seal to
the Contract; and thereupon was forced to give Security to the Parish for the
maintenance thereof.

Thus many Men, they laugh at others Crimes,
Though they themselves, Committ such many times,
Mocking is Catching, now the Cobbler sees,
For his past Pleasure; he must Pay his Fees,

Printed For William Hurd, near the Strand.
