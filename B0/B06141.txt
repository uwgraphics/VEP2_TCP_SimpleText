To the Right Honorable Sir Patient Ward, Knight. Lord Mayor of the City of
LONDON, and to the Right Worshipful, the Aldermen his Brethren,
The Humble Petition of Us whose Names are here Subscribed, and of many other
Citizens and Inhabitants of the City of London; his Majesty's Loyal Subjects.
Shows,
THat your Petitioners being deeply sensible of the many Instances which they
have had the Honor to receive, of his Majesty's Princely Goodness and Bounty;
and more particularly, in His Royal Assurances of a full Resolution to have
Frequent Parliaments; and both In, and Out of Parliament touse his utmost
Endeavors to extirpate Popery; to redress all the Grievances of his Good
Subjects; and in all things to Govern according to the Laws of the Kingdom:
Which his Sacred Majesty has been Graciously pleased, with a most Express
Solemnity, to promise, and to publish unto the World in his Late Princely
Declaration.

In the Contemplation of a Goodness so ample, and so effectual, that there is
nothing further wanting toward the Composing of Men's Minds; the creating of a
Right Understanding betwixt his Majesty and his Liege-People; and (under Gods
Providence) toward the Establishment of a Distracted Nation in Agreement,
Peace, and Plenty; saving only the Dutiful Return of Veneration and Obedience,
from the Subject, in acknowledgement of the Fatherly Tenderness of so Indulgent
a Sovereign.

Your Humble Petitioners cannot but in Reverence, and Gratitude, Declare, that
We are Unanimously Resolved to lay our Lives and Fortunes at His Majesty's
Feet, in Defense of his Sacred Person, against all Opposition whatsoever; and
in the Maintenance of the Established Religion, and the Government both of
Church and State, as it is settled by Law; pursuant to the Tenor of his
Majesty's Royal Declaration, and the Duty of all Loyal Subjects.

May it Therefore please your Lordship, and this Honorable Court, to present
This our Humble Aadress, Declaration, and Resolution, to his most Gracious
Majesty, in such manner as unto You shall seem meet;

And Your Petitioners (as in Duty bound) shall ever Pray.
