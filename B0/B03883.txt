The Merry MAN'S Resolution Or, A LONDON Frollick.
He goes a wooing yet the matters so,
He cares not much whether he speeds or no,
Cause City Wives and Wenches are so common
He thinks it hard to find an honest Woman
Ben't angry with this fellow, I protest,
That many a true word has been spoke in jest.
By degrees he lays a wager money's scant,
Until five Shillings out, then ends his Rant.
T. J.
I Will hold thee five Shillings.




IF young Men and Maidens
will listen a while,
I Will sing you a Sonnet
will make you to smile,
Then come my own Dearest
and be not so coy,
Whatever thou fear
i will get thee a boy.
I Will hold thee a sixpence
it is silver complete.
If thou art but willing
I can do the feat.
Then be not so scornful
but loving and kind,
If thou will but kiss me
i will tell thee my mind,
For I am a Gallant
that is versed in the trade,
I know what belongs to
Wife Widow and Maid,
I Will hold thee a shilling
as round as a Ring,
Those Lasses that kiss well,
loves the the other thing.
Then Dear let me feel if
thy flesh it be warm,
For I vow and protest I
will do thee no harm,
But huddle and cuddle,
we will toy and we will kiss,
What hurt honest Neighbors
can come of all this,
I Will hold you three six-pences
in ready Coin,
Most Girls when they are pleased
with young Men will join.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
BUt when they are sullin
never matter't a pin,
But rouxe'um and touz'um
'twill please um again:
And when you have done it,
this story is true,
If you do but kiss um
they will straight ways kiss you.
I Will hold you two shillings,
lay with me that can,
The fairest in the Nation
will lie with a Man.
Then why should young Females
Continue so nice,
When Ladies of pleasure
do count it no vice
To be kind to their Neighbors
as well as the rest,
For kissing and courting
is still in request,
I Will hold two and sixpence
that is just half a crown
Highest Girls in all Europe,
Are easiest blown down.
To talk of complections
too tedious it were,
Or to know their conditions
by the color of hair;
Yet this i will assure you,
either Black, Red or Brown
When they are in the humor
they will freely lie down.
I Will hold you three shillings
who against me dare lay
That women delight much
with young men to play.
There Is Mary and Betty,
with Nancy and Jone,
They Will lie with a Tinker
ere they will lie alone.
There Is Peg, Dol and Bridget
Rebecca and Kate,
They laugh when they hear on it
but long till they hav't
I Will hold three and sixpence
Maids love Men the best,
When they come a woeing
in earnest not jest.
Fine Susan and Sarah,
brave Lasses indeed,
Yet they will ly with a Broom-man
if they stand in need,
Likewise pretty Parnel,
and simpering Sisse
When young Men embrace them
how kindly they kiss
I Will hold you four shillings
the nicest that be,
At one time or other
makes use of a P --
Then dear be contented
for thou shall have one,
And shall be prevented
of lying alone.
For I Am stout and lusty
and fit for delight,
I Will hug thee and kiss thee
ten times in an night
I Will hold four and sixpence
I Will hold thee no less,
I Will bore a hole through thy coat
even by guess.
For I am an Archer,
Well skilled in that art
Though I shoot at young Damsels
they nere feel it smart
I Will hold thee five shillings,
i will hold thee no more,
I Will bore a hole through thy smock
even before.
This Song throughout England
on purpose I send,
To make young Men merry,
and there is an end.
Finis.
