Ars moriendi,

Here begins a little treatise shortly compyled, and called Ars moriendi /
that is to say the craft to dye, For the health of man's soul.



When any of lykelyhode shall dye / than is most necessary to have a special
friend: the which will hertelye help and pray for him / and there with
counceyll the sick / for the well of his soul / and moreoucr to se that al
other so do about him / or else quyckefy for to make him depart. Than is to
be remembered the great benefaytes of god done for him unto the time / and
specially of the passion of our Lord / and than is to be read some story of
saints / or the.vii. Psalms with the letany / or our Lady psalter i^ part or
hole with other. And ever the image of the crucyfyxe is to be had in his sight
with other. And holy water is often times to be cast upon and about him for a
voydynge of evil spyrytes / the which tha^ be full ready to take their
advantage of the foul if they may. And than and ever make him cry for mercy
and grace and for the help of our blyssed lady and of other saints in whom
before he had a synguler trust and love / and there upon to make his prayers if
he may.

When dcthe comes or any grievous pains or other great syckenes / than prayer
or devotion asswageth / wherefore it is wysdom for one to pray before any
syckenes come / and also when one may i^ his syckenes if he will not be
deceived.

So he is happy and may be glad / that in such a time of most need has a
faithful friend and that will say beside the / prayers before reherced and
cause other to say devoutly in remembrance of the charity of Jesus christ and
of his passion / and for to have the rather his mercy and help three Pater
nosters and three Aues with a credo: and therewith to exhort him by a priest /
or for need by another i^ the manner as it follows.

BRother or sufter remember well that god says by his Prophet and Eua^gelyst.
Glyssed be tho that dye and depart in our lord / that is to say / from the
world and his pleasures and dye in the true faith of the church and
repentance for his sins. Sir ye have great cause to be glad for to depart
from this wretched world and vale of all myserye / and think that ye needs
must depart / and desire hertely to be with Jesus christ our maker / redemer /
lord god for he shall give to you now your enherytaunce that he did bye for
you with his precious passion and blood / wherefore this time of your departing
shall be better to you than the time of your birth / for now all syckenes
sorrow and trouble shall depart now from you for ever. Therefore be not
agreued with your syckenes / and take it not with grutchynge but take it rather
with all gladness.

Se at all times that ye be stable in your faith and believe and say your Credo
if that ye may / or else desire another hertefy to do it for you / here before
us openly. And arm you with the sign of the Cross as a cry sten man for your
defense against yor ghostly enemies / in the which doing god will be greatly
pleased / and the rather take you for one of his folk by proteccyon and grace
and ay his child of salvation. Have ever a good and true believe / and no
thing may be impossyble unto you. And ever be ware that ye fall not in
dyspayre / for that greatly woll displease god / and can not be remedyed. And
remember the sins that was done a fore time / shall never hurt you as to
dampnacyon / if they please you not now and that ye be sorry for them. Saint
Jerome says / if one should take his syckenes / or his death with grutchyng it
is a token that he loves not god suffycyently / all is ryghtwyse that we
suffer. Desire with saint Austyn of our Lord here to be cut with trybulact
on / and to be brenned with syckenes and sorrow / so they may be saved here
after for ever. Now meke your self and be sorry that ye have been so unkind to
please / and to keep his commandments and presume not as of your self any
goodness / and say with all mekenes thus. Good lord Ihesu christ I knowledge
that I have sinned grievously and by thy grace / I will gladly amend me if I
should live have mercy now of me for thy bitter passion. Than ask him these
qusty one following before his death.

BE ye glad that ye shall dye in cryste^ believe. Let him answer / ye know if
ye have not so well lived as ye should / ye have will to amend if that ye
should live / ye / believe ye that Jesus christ gods sone of heaven was borne
of the blyssed vyrgyn Marye / ye / believe ye also that Jesus christ dyed upon
the cross to bye man's soul on good frydaye / ye / do ye thank god therefore
/ ye.

Believe ye that ye may not be saved but by his passion and death / ye / as long
as the soul in is your body / thank god of this death and have a sure trust
by it and his passion to be saved / and cou^ceyll him to say if that he may
these words following of great virtue.

I Put christ's passion betwyxte me and mine evil works / and betwyxte me and
his wrath. Now lord god be merciful to me a sinner. The peace of our lord
Jesus christ and the virtue of his passion with the sign of the holy cross
and the vndefoyled vyrgynyte of the blyssed Mary his mother / and the blyssynge
of all saints and the proteccyon of all holy aungelles with the help and
prayer of al saints be betwyxt me and al mine enemies now and in the hour of
my death and departing.

Also these verses following be of great virtue in the time of death / and to be
said of the sick if he may or of another for him

Dirupisti domine vincula mea / tibi sacrificabo hostia^ laudis: et nomen dn^i
inuocabo. Deus propitius esto mihi peccatori. laus sit tibi pro amara passione
tua.

Also to our lady.
Maria plena gratie matter misericordie tunos ab hofte protege and hora mortis
suscipe.

And at last.
In manus tuas domine co^mendo spititum meum. etc.

Here follows a short and sweet reme^ brau^ce of the sacrament of the awter
or that it be received of the sick person or any other before their coming.
WElcome blyssed Jesus my lord god and savior to whom is appropryed all mercy
and pity. Remember good lord / how frail my nature and substance is / and
have mercy and pity on me great sinner after thy great mercyes / and for thy
bitter passion / for I knowledge and believe faith fully as a christian child of
thine / that thou here in form of bread is the same my lord god that of thy
goodness came down from heaven and was borne and took the nature of the blyssed
vyrgyn Mary / and dyed for me and tose the third day and after ascended in to
heaven / and there reygneth with the father and the holy ghost all saints for
ever imor tall / the which for our great health fraylte and daily tra^sgressyon
have ordained this thy blyssed body in this wise to be taken of me and of other
wyllyng to be saved I know well that I am far unworthy to be called thy
child or servant / for the great multitude of my sins / how be it thou
may make me tyght full and able / the which only of sinners have made great
saints i^ heaven. By thy great power and might / grant me now to take the
mekely in all fere and in waylynge for my sins and with spyrytuall gladness.
Come now good lord in to my heart and cleanse it all of sin / enter in to my
soul and make it hole / and therewith sanctyfye me within and without / and be
my defense for body and soul rebukynge and put tynge aside all mine enemies
far fro the presence of thy power / that I than so defended by the / may have
a fre and sure passage to the kingdom where I shall not se the in I know well
that I have greuyd the merciful lord / and broken thy commandments / in
the which thou only ought to be worshypped. The second say this. Good lord
I have a good purpose and desire with thy help to be right ware hereafter /
that I fall not in to sin / and I entende to flee the occasyone after the
possybylyte of my power. The third is this. Gracyous lord I have good will to
make an hole Confession of all my sins / when place and time co^uenyent may
be had according to thy commandments and all holy church. These.iii.
verytes or treuthes who soever says with heart vnfeynyngly in what place that
ever he be / he may be sure that he is in the state of salvation / and that he
shall have euerlaftyng life / though he had done all the sins of the world.
And if he decessed without any confession for lack of a preeft / as slepynge
or sudden death / he should be saved suffrynge before hard pains in purgatory
/ wherefore it is good counceyll / that every cryften man ones or twyes on the
day / erly orlate / or else at leest on holy days examyne his conscience and
remember if that he may with all his heart vnfaynyngly these said.iii.
treuthes / and if he can so do / he may be sure that he is i^ the state of
grace / and if he may not / but is in will to sin again the occasyons of
mortal sin / and so drowned in sin will not arise / such one may be sure
that the pope may not assoyse him / not for thy good it is that such one use
much prayer and give alms and do good deeds after their power / that god
the rather may lyghten their hertes / and the sooner turn to goodness. Amen.

Here after follows the.xii. degrees of Humylyte.
Cast thy sight downewarde and show meekness both in thy heart and body.
Beware of high speech and clamours and se that thy words be few well set and
reasonable. Be not light for to laughe / but use ever sadness. Be still and
keep scylence to need require that answer must be had. Keep well the co^myn
rule as the holy place has used. Think the most vylest of all other and so
pronounce thy self. Knowledge the unworthy and not profitable to any thing and
so believe in deed. Make often confession of thy sins and that with great
contrycyon. Keep paryence in thyn obedyence / at thy pains and trouble. To all
people be thou not subgect for thy maysterssake. Thyn own will forsake it /
andlone it in no wise. And ever keep the from sin / for fere of him above.
The.vii. degrees of obedyence.
The first / is to do that is commanded of thy sovereign without grutchynge.
The second / is to make none excepcyon neither of the time neither of the deed
that is to be done. The third / is to be glad and chereful in thy heart to do
such deeds commanded without any compulcion setting aside at beestly
condycyons. The.iiii. to be quycke in such deed doing leuynge at other
occupacyons for that time or any manner of excuse. The.v. is to do such things
with all thy might and power thinking that thy reward shall be great.
The.vi. is to do them also with all meekness both in spyryte and gesture.
The.vii. is to continue such obedyence to the end of thy life / ever
following thy master Jesus chtyste that was made obedyent for thy sin unto
death.
The.vii. degrees of pacyence.
The.vii. degrees of pacye^ce thou may behold here. To evil done to the or
aduersyte make no resystence. Do not evil for evil ne give no evil answer.
Love thyn enemy and do good for evil or him in recompense. Grutche not
against aduersyte / but take it as sweet ensence. Account it for best medycyne
/ and but glad in thy pain. Thank god therefore and look for more with all
benyuolence. And when thou haste no grutchynge in these than may thou be
feign.
The.xv. degrees of charity.
These make perfyke charity after Poules epystole. Be pacyent co^tynuell for
any aduersyte. Lyberall to the nedy / and do good for evil.
