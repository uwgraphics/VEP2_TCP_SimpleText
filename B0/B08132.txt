NEW DIRECTIONS OF EXPERIENCE TO THE COMMONS COMPLAINT BY THE Encouragement of
the Kings most excellent Majesty, as may appear, for the planting of Timber
and Firewood. WITH A NEAR ESTIMATION what millions of Acres the kingdom does
contain; what Acres is waste ground, whereon little profit for this purpose
will arise. WHAT MILLIONS HAS BIN Woods, and Bushy grounds, what Acres are
Woods, and in how many Acres so much Timber will be contained, as will
maintain the Kingdom for all uses for ever. AND HOW AS GREAT STORE OF
Firewood may be raised, as may plentifully mainetaine the Kingdom for all
purposes, without loss of ground; so as within thirty years all Spring-woods
may be converted to Tillage and Pasture.

WHEREAS Arthur Standish (Gentleman) has taken much pains, and been at great
charges in composing and publishing in a book, some proiects for the increasing
of Woods, the decay whereof in this Realm is universally complained of: And
therefore We would be glad that any invention might further the restoring
thereof: We have therefore been pleased to give allowance to this Book, and
to the Printing thereof. And if the same shall be willingly received of the
Gentlemen, and others of ability, who have grounds fitting for his proiects, it
shall much content Us, doubting not, but that such as shall think good to make
use of the Book, will deal worthily with him for his pains. And We are also
pleased for the better encouragement of the said Standish, hereby to declare,
that Our pleasure is, that no Person or Persons whatsoever, shall Print any of
the said Books, but for and to the use of the said Standish, and none others.

New Directions for the planting of Wood, by Arthur Standish.
WHEREAS It pleased the Kings most Excellent Majesty, forth of his Princely
respect, for the better repairing of the ruin of this Kingdom, for the good
of every particular person: the public good of the Commonwealth, and the
preserving and maintaining of the same for all posterity, to give alowance to
the Printing and publishing of the Book, that I presented unto his Majesty,
principally concerning the planting and preserving of wood, as has and does
appear to all men, whereby I am the better animated by his Majesty, and many
other good men, to persevere in so needful and more then necessary business,
and to apply my whole endeavor, to seek out all possible means that may be
found to effect the same: with the least charge and loss of ground, the better
to encourage all his loving Subjects thereunto: by means whereof, together
with the daily conference that I have with many of the better sort; and often,
for this purpose with Husbandmen, and workmen; who (for the most part) have
best experience in this business, being loath to write more then by mine own
eie-sight I know to be true. Further, seeking to know the opinions and
experience of many understanding and good Commonwealths men, to several ends;
and having conference with some skillful Surueyors of Land, and such as take
upon them to know the number of Acres, that are contained in this Kingdom:
Thus, observing what I hear or see, tending to any public good, especially
for this business, I attain to a near estimation what Acres the Kingdom
does contain, what acres will plentifully supply all wants, and maintain the
Kingdom for ever, being planted and preserved, as follows: and how as great
store of Firewood may be raised, being maintained, as may plentifully
maintain the Kingdom for all purposes, as well for the making of iron, and all
other mettalls that the Kingdom does afford for ever; so far from the loss
or hurt to land, as it may rather greatly better and improve it: First, it is
generally decreed by all Surueyours, that the whole kingdom contains nine
and twenty millions, five hundred sixty eight thousand acres, or near
thereabouts: whereof it is supposed that there is four millions, and all the
odd thousands waste, that yields little or no profit at all; and that there
has been within a hundred years last past, four millions of woods and bushy
grounds, that yielded little profit, but wood and bushes, over and above
Parkes, Forests, and Chases.

Forth of which twenty nine millions, and the odd thousands, the wastes being
deducted, which in effect is five millions, the remainder is five and twenty
millions: whereon wood, has, does, or would grow, if it were planted and
preserved: First, for this purpose, take forth of every thousand acres, forty
four acres, enclose and plant the same according to the directions following:
Wheresoever it lies, plant four acres of every forty four in rows, so as
there may be contained in a hundred thousand acres, so much timber as will
plentifully serve the Kingdom for all uses, every tree to be ten yards distant
one from an other one way, and three the other, which can be no loss to such
as shall plant, neither for their own uses, nor for such as want ground to
plant on; in respect that such as want, must be constrained to buy of such as
have to sell, which is so far from the loss of any, as it will be for their
greatest profit; for after twenty years the forty acres will yield much more
profit, either in corn or grass then the four and forty did before, over
and above the benefit of the timber; and in the mean time, little or no
loss. The like planting for firewood might be made in rows, as shall
appear, but it is altogether needelesse; for the very hedges, being planted
and made as after follows, will yield Firewood plentifully for all uses, as
by experience shall appear, so as within thirty years it may be more then
needful to have any Copies or Spring-woods at all, but that all Wood-land may
be converted to Tillage or Pasture, to the particular good of the Owners and
Common wealth. Further, showing in particular, what public good may arise
thereby. In the mean time, it were very convenient, that the stocking up of
woods were prevented, except they were stocked up into rows, for it is
generally conceived, that within a very few years, there will be little or no
wood left for any use, the stocking and stubbing is so great, notwithstanding
the Laws provided, by the worthy King of famous memory Henry the eight, for
the preserving of wood; which laws have been from time to time continued, and
are still in force, and have been most earnestly called upon by the Kings
Majesty ever since his coming to this kingdom, especially at every high
Court of Parliament, where he has not only required the continuance thereof,
but also most earnestly given it in charge (especially at the last Parliament)
that some course might be taken for the planting and preserving of woods, which
assuredly (as I have heard) was intended at the last sitting in Parliament, the
which cannot be unknown to such as daily stock and stubbe up woods: neither
respecting the displeasure of his Majesty, nor the breach of the Laws in that
case provided. In every country wood is daily stubbed up, especially within
twenty miles of London, where wood is precious, and too dear for the poorer
sort; by means thereof, they are constrained to break hedges, to the great
decaying of wood, and to the grieuance of every man that has woods and hedges,
and to their great charge, which I find generally complained of, and daily
more and more will be complained of: for (say the poor) Though they want
victuals, that is too dear for them to get by their honest labor, yet will
they not perish for want of fire, so long as it is to be gotten. The best
remedy for the same, is, a general Plantation, whereby no one man may feel
the loss that some few do, that plant; for as they plant the one day, the
poor pluck or cut them up the next day, if not the same night. Which, if all
men should be constrained to plant, it would be as it is in Worcester shire
with fruit, where the plenty is so great, as the stealing of some few is never
missed: Even so would it be by the general planting of wood, and in time be
grown so cheap, as the poor would rather choose to buy then steal it.

Also the making of iron and glass, has been, and is the greatest decay of
wood; notwithstanding, iron was never so ill, nor never so dear as it is at
this instant, by the half, before so great store was made in this kingdom;
and by all likelihood is likely to grow dearer: the reasons why it is so dear,
are especially two; the one in respect that wood is so worn out, as many are
constrained to give over the making thereof: which want may be supplied by the
means following, namely, out of hedges by lop-wood, which will approuedly make
as good char-cole for all uses, as any other wood, which may be continued so
long as it shall please GOD the Kingdom shall endure: the other is in respect,
that before so great store of iron was made in this Kingdom, the Merchants
bought Cloth of the Clothiers, which beyond the Seas they exchanged for iron;
which was better iron, and better cheap then the English iron: the want of
which exchange, together with the transporting of Wool beyond the Seas, the
worthy trade of clothing is so decayed, as many poor people that were set on
work by the abler sort of Clothiers, are constrained to beg, that before lived
well by their labor: Also there are millions of people that live in great
fear, that they in a short time may fall into the like necessity, which are
the Carpenters, the Shippe-wrights, the Plough and Cart-makers, the Ioyners,
the Cowpers, and the Coach-maker. Whereupon it is generally conceived by all
men of judgment, that enter into consideration of the premises, that without
a speedy general Planting and Preserving, both of Timber and Firewood be,
the Kingdom by no means can be maintained another Age; which with small cost
and labor (to willing minds) in good time, may be preserved and maintained,
as plentifully as ever heretofore: as shall be proved to the glory of God,
content of his Majesty, their own selves, posterity, and Commonwealth.

Concerning the Planting and Preserving of Timber, all men with whom I have
conuersed, are of one mind, that a better direction then herein is set down
cannot be devised, which is, by planting groves of a Roode, or half a Roode
of ground in a Grove, in pasture grounds (or as follows,) especially in
Rows, whereby much more timber may be raised in less ground as shall appear;
which being performed, there will be timber enough for all purposes, with the
surplusses of Timber that may be planted and preserved in Forests, Chases,
Parks, Commons, or common Pasture, and much the better it will continue, if it
be so provided, that none shall fell or other-waies make away any tree or
trees, but to be enjoined to plant and preserve so many as shall be felld, or
otherways made away. Thus may Timber be raised two several ways; the one in
Groves, the other in Rows: for Groves, such as have but one hundred acres, and
so for such as have more, to enclose for every hundred acres, one several Rood
in some corner of a Close, which is already enclosed, for the ing of
chrsauages, where half of the Fence is already made, and is to be maintained
notwithstanding this device; or rather in the midst of a Close, although the
charge be something the more, where the cattle may not only have shadow in
Summer, but also shelter in Winter, every way the better. To improve the close
and cattle, the plot of ground for this purpose of one roode, would be in
length ten pole, in breadth four: in which length there is contained fifty
five yards, and in breadth twenty two yards. In which plot of ground there may
be planted five rows of trees for Timber, and in every row there must be
dug up fourteen plots of a yard square, which should be dug up two
several times, between Midsummer and Michaelmasse; and again, when the
means following are to be set, according to the nature of the soil, and the
directions following; every plot to be four yards distant every way one from
an other; so there may be contained in a Rood of ground threescore and ten
trees. And in every of these plots so dug, there may be set nine, a foot
one from another, (either Akornes, Chessenuts, Beech-maste, Keys of Ash,
Roots or Chips of Elm) being so set, and come up, the ground would be weeded
twice, or thrice the first and second year, if occasion serve, and after four
or five years, when it may be discerned which of the^ is likest to be the best
trees, there would be but four left, the other would be drawn up and planted
elsewhere at the Owners pleasure. And after sixeteene or twenty years three
of the other may be felld, and made away for some uses; and only one, being
the very best, to remain; from which all the leaves would be plucked off by
hand within a foot of the top, in the beginning of June, so long as a man can
reach them, and afterward cut off with a knife, or light forest bill, made
for that purpose. The reason why I wish the planting of Groves to be in so many
seueralls, is, that when a Grove is felld, it should be all felld: for the
felling of trees in woods at several times, has been a great decay to wood.
And further, by experience it may be proved, that seldom good timber grows
of old stocks; by reason whereof, I could wish that trees should rather be
stocked up, then felld, that the ground might be planted again. The second way
for planting in rows is as hereafter follows.

For the planting in Barren, Champaine, or Gorssie grounds, either for Timber
or Firewood.
IF in all Champaine Countries, where land is barren, and fuel so scant, that
they are constrained to burn the straw, and manure, which should be employed
to the manuring of land; the want thereof is the utter undoing of many a
Husbandman, who tilleth much land, sows much seed, and reapeth much loss,
for want of manure. If therefore (I say) not only of my self, but also in the
opinions of many understanding men, inhabiting in such countries, that if some
part of their barest grounds that lies so far from the town whereunto it does
belong, that seldom, or never it is manured: by reason whereof it often lies
ley, and yields no profit: if for this purpose, there were eleven acres of
that land, as it lies together, and that one acre of the eleven were planted
with wood in rows, and after that rate for more or less, according to the
number of the Acres that are in the possession of the Lords of Land, and their
Tenants in every town; which acre may thus be planted: (first it is to be
understood, that a statute acre does contain in length 220. yards, and in
breadth, two and twenty. First make a good Fence, according to the directions
following, and then begin at a side of the eleven acres, and measure ten
yards in breadth, and in every eleventh yard dig up five and fifty plots of
ground of a yard square; and so in every eleventh yard from side to side: Every
plot to be three yards between one an other in the rows, over and above the
square yard for firewood; for Timber but two yards between the square yards,
so as there may be three score and fourteen plots in every row, and so
planted and observed, as before is declared. Whereby there may be contained in
one acre, one thousand six hundred and odd trees for timber: In four acres
of the thousand, six thousand and four score, every tree to grow one from
another ten yards one way, and three the other; and for firewood, one
thousand one hundred and ten. There may be also contained in one entire acre,
one thousand two hundred and ten trees for timber, every one to have four
yards of ground to thrive on.

These Directions may be observed by such as are desirous to plant spacious
grounds, so far from the loss of ground, as the ground thereby may be much
improoued, especially if the ground be barren, by letting it lie ley four or
five years after it is planted; which lying will better the ground, so as it
may be plowed between the rows, and sown with corn, and for two or three
years have good croppes: in which time the plants will be so grown up, as it
may be a sheepe-pasture, till the wood be past taking hurt by cattle: in which
time the shadow of the trees, and the rotting of leaves, and the manure of the
sheep will better the ground, so as it will be good meadow, pasture, or corn
ground, at the Owners pleasure, for his best profit. This were a very
profitable course to be observed in sheepe-walkes, on Downs, where hedge-wood
is scant, as commonly it is in such barren grounds. The best way to enclose, is
(if it be in swarthy grounds) to set the aforesaid means as a foote-set of
thorns without any ditch, and to raise the Fence of either side by walls of
Soddes, as is to be seen between Lincoln and the Horse-race, or as commonly
sheep pens are made in Downs and Heaths: If no swarth, by a double ditch,
and set the means on the top of a bank, being made a yard broad on the top,
so as a hedge of a foot high of either side will serve to defend it; and by a
like planting in all gorssie grounds, where gorsse grows so naturally that
the Owners of the grounds can by no means destroy it: great store of timber or
firewood may be raised, with the other profits, and the soil much improued:
for after the trees be past taking hurt by cattle, the gorsse between the
rows may be stocked up, so as the ten yards of ground between the rows may
be sown with corn, and being limed when it is tilled, the lime, together
with the shadow of the trees, will approuedly so destroy the gorsse, as the
ground will be recovered to be corn, meadow, or pasture. In like sort, all
broomy ground may be improued. Some that have gorssie grounds, have objected,
that if their gorsse should be destroyed, they should be damnified thereby, in
regard they have no better fuel. To such I have given good satisfaction, that
it is not intended, that the gorsse should be destroyed, before the wood be
past taking hurt by cattle, when the wood will yield better fuel, and better
store.

How to improve barren ground.
THE best remedy for barren grounds, either for sandy or clay, for fruit trees,
or any kind of wood, to make them grow speedily, and without moss, is for
sandy land, to make a hole, so big, as it will hold the quantity of three
bushells of good earth, and a bushel of vnslecked lime; then put into the hole
a third part of the lime, and upon that lime, lay a third part of the earth,
and upon that earth, another part of the lime, and upon that lime a third part
of earth, and so the rest: and in like sort sand and lime for clay land, and so
lay more or less, as occasion serves. Thus mingle them together, and let it
lie a quarter of a year before it is to be used; and when you remove a young
tree, or set a stock to graffe on, lay under, and about the root a bushel of
the lime and earth well mingled together, and power thereon a paile full of
water, which water will wash the earth close to every root. And to any kind of
Peach or Plumb-stone half a pecke; and for Chessenuts, Akornes, or any other
kind of seeds of wood, use this mingled earth in discretion, and approouedly
thus being used, they will grow more in one year then in any other ground in
two, though the soil be good: and it is a special good manuring for corn,
the nature of lime is to make clay-land lighter, and sand-land stiffer, as
partly may appear in buildings, that lime and sand do make mortar, when it is
dry, as hard as stones.

For the planting of Timber Trees, or Firewood, in Forests, Chases, Parkes,
Commons, and common Pastures.
EXperience has, and may teach all men to know, for it is to be seen with the
eyes of all men, that in all ages, bushes have been, are, and will be (if they
be preserved) in all grounds, the mother and nurse of trees, so that all men
may take notice thereby, that by the digging up of a hole a foot square, and
three or four fingers deep, in the midst of any tuft of bushes, gorsse,
furs, or whins, as some term them, or in hollinbushes, and therein to set 3.
of the mast of oak, chessenuts, beech, keys of ash, the roots, or chips of
elm, or rather roots or sykamore seeds which will grow as fast as any other
wood, the body good for little, but for to make trenchers, or drinking-cups,
and for those uses, better then any other wood growing in this kingdom, as
before is set down: any of these, according to the nature of the soil, wherein
these are to be planted: out of which three it is not to be doubted, but one of
them at the least, will grow and prosper, the bushes being preserved about them,
till the plants be past taking hurt by cattle. This may be performed with a
small charge, for a man may set a hundred in a day at the least, by experience
I speak it, which can not cost above twelve pence (a thousand for ten
shillings.)

Many there are that like well of this planting of wood, and many do observe
it, that before were desirous to raise wood, by taking up of young trees where
they did grow and prosper; which are weary of that kind of planting, by reason
that for the most part, half of them do not grow, which moves many to
observe these directions: And some there are that say they like these
directions well; but say they, it is against the nature of this Age to tarry so
long for profit. To which I answer, That if the Ancestors of noblemen,
gentlemen, and others, had had so little respect to their posterity, as we have
in this Age; there are some noblemen, and many others, that would have been
constrained to have sold a great part of the land their Ancestors left them,
to supply the wants which they have supplied by their woods; and it will fall
so out ere it be long, that such must sell land, for wood their Ancestors will
leave them none to sell: And to content such, and all others, I have added by
experience directions for this present Age, as follows toward the latter end
of this Book.

For the planting of Firewood about Parkes.
HOw all Parkes may be fenced by firewood, so as after ten or twelve years
it will be stronger then any pale; and after forty years stronger then any
wall, and longer lasting by many degrees: and being once made, never to be made
again, with the charge and profit that may arise thereby. Say for this
purpose, that there is a park to be fenced of four miles pale-walke, which
miles contain in length thirty two furlongs of Statute-measure, every furlong
contains forty poles, every pole five yards and a half: Admit there were no
ditch at all about the pale, nor wood (as commonly there is) and that all were
to be ditched and fenced anew, with a ditch of five foot wide at the top, a
foot and a half broad in the bottom, and three foot deep, and that this
ditch, with the getting and setting of the means aforesaid, for the planting
of timber, should cost twelve pence a pole; the total of the charge three
score and three pounds at the most: for it is certain, that much of this may
be saved: for in many places the ditch cannot be so chargeable; for about many
parks in some places, there need no ditch at all, and in some places, a less
ditch will serve. Neither can the hedging be chargeable in two respects; the
one, by reason that about many Parkes, there are many thorns growing, which
being felld to make the fence once, will afterward so grow up, as they will
defend the wood so set without any further charge; and about many parkes there
is as much wood growing as will defray the charge: so as to some the effecting
of this business, will be little or no charge at all. The earth of this new
ditch must be cast to the pale-ward, so as the bank may be a yard broad on the
top: fence there needs none, but long bushes so put between the pales above
the railes, as they may reach and hang over the bank into the ditch.

This being done, for such soiles as by experience Maste and Seeds will best
like of, as may best appear by the wood thereon growing, the Maste would be
gathered as it falls from the tree, and not beaten down before it be ripe.
The Ash keys may be gathered about Alhollontide: being thus gotten and
gathered in, they would be kept neither too wet nor too dry, till they be set,
according to the directions following. The roots of Elm are to be gotten by
baring old Elmes at the root, between Alhollontide and Candlemasse, when the
sap of trees is in the roots, from whence there may be taken, without hurt
to the Elm, many young roots of the bigness of a little finger, and a foot
long. And as of Elm, so of Wiche, being a wood as apt to grow speedily as any
other, which are to be cut from the old roots. These young roots would be set
as a foot-set of thorns within a foot of the pale, so as the thorns may hang
over them; set in the ground, and one inch out of the ground: so likewise in
the sides of banks, as quick-sets, they are to be set in 2. rows, 3. fingers
broad between the rows, and so set as they may not stand directly one against
another. The maste and seeds would also be so set in two rows, three fingers
between every row, three fingers deep, and four in a foot in either row.
The boughs of Elm, Willows, or Sallow, would be lopped from the trees
between mid-March and the midst of April, when the sap is in them, and
before the leaves put forth; they would be of three or four years growth, of
the freshest, sappiest, and knottiew. Thus being lopped from the trees, they
would be cut in length of a foot long, colt-footed at either end, the boughs
and twigges being cut off close to the body: they would be laid in trenches in
two rows, three fingers deep, with the knotty side upward, and three fingers
between the rows a hand breadth one from an other, and covered with earth,
which is neither weedy nor grassie. These boughs would be laid the same day
that they are lopped, or the next day after at the farthest, or set in the
ground as sets a foot deep.

This being done, they will within six or seven years be grown so high, as
the plants may be bended, and laid as a plashed hedge, but not cut at the
roots: the reason is, that being so young the plants will easily bend, which
way a man will have them, and when they are to be laid, the row that is to be
laid, would be shread close to the body, and topped so high as when they are
laid, the top may lie seven foot wide from the root, and so high as a beast
may not reach the tops: And when the row is in laying, if they grow thicker
then a foot asunder, some may be cut up for bindings, to bind them down that
are laid, for thicker then a foot asunder is needelesse for them to be laid.
The other row would be yearly shread, and kept with small tops, the lesser to
hurt the Fence so laid, and some of them are to be bound into the fence so
laid, to stand three or four years for stakes, so as those that are thus
bound down after two or three years, will continue so, and lie as railes; and
if cattle be kept from the browsing of them but a year: the boughs will
spring forth of the knots, so as the Fence will be both thick and strong, and
much the stronger, by the help of the other row, which after the fence of it
self is grown strong, may be felled and employed to other uses. This in
common reason (as I said before) cannot but in ten or twelve years be a
stronger Fence then any pale, and in a short time stronger then any wall, and
longer lasting, without further charge. And this for experience, in part, may
be seen in all wood-land countries, especially in Fences about Woods, where it
is to be seen, that for want of thorns in many places all kind of woods are
plashed, and thus laid, which in some places have lain so long, as they are
grown so great, that they are incorporated one into another; notwithstanding
likes very well, and yields much firewood by lopping off the tops and
boughs that are grown forth of them so lying.

And as in this, so in other things, by experience I write of that which mine
eyes have seen in many places for two or three poles together, where there
have been five or six heads growing out of one tree so laid. And for the
better proof hereof, I have also seen, as I have rode by the way, in an
Orchard (in little Waltham in Essex, four miles at the most from Chelmsford,)
an Apple tree that was blown down many years since, which lies close to the
ground, the root having some small hold in the ground, which has put forth of
the body so lying, five trees at the least, which are so nourished as they
bear fruit. I have also seen in a town within two miles of Stone in Stafford
shire, in a ground of master Ratliffes, a Peare-tree that was likewise blown
down, bigger then a fadome about, that stood in a hedge, which tree lies a
yard from the ground, being stayed so by two boughs that stick in the ground,
which has so taken root, as thereby, with the help especially of some part
of the root, that it has also put forth, and nourishes five trees as big
as the calfe of a man's leg, which grow a yard one from another; whereby it
may the better appear, that this kind of Fencing may be performed, not
only with wood, but also with Apple and Peare-trees, if need required, with
such as like thereof, to the good of themselves and commonwealth.

Another kind of fencing there is, that many do like better of, then the
laying of the wood, as is aforesaid, which by experience may be performed by
letting the plants grow, and never to lay them, but yearly to shread the twigs
of the one row, that after is to be felld, so as they may be kept with small
tops, the less to hurt those that are to remain for the Fence, which row
that is to stand for the Fence, would be topped at sixeteene or twenty years
growth, fifteen or sixteen foot high from the ground, and again after eight
years, and then for the better increasing of firewood they would be so
lopped, as there may be as well three heads of a tree, as one, and every head
to yield as much wood, as if there were but one head of the tree: if when the
worke-man does top a tree, he would top it where the tree puts forth most
boughs, within three inches above the knottiest place of the tree, not too
flat, as many worke-men do, but sloping, the less to take water for the
rotting of the tree: at which second lopping, all the boughs would be lopped
off close to the head of the tree, but only three of the greatest; the one
that grows directly up, to be topped half a yard above the head of a tree;
the other two would be of those that grow outward, from either side of the
tree from the rowe-ward, the less to hurt the row by dropping: which two
would be lopped four foot off from the body of the tree, by which means, as
well from this, as from the other kind of fencing, there may be lopped from a
Park of four miles pale, yearly, after one and twenty years, two furlongs
of sixeteene years growing; and as in every pole there was sixteen let to
grow, so there are sixteen to be yearly lopped, which being husbanded, as
aforesaid, would yield eight and forty heads, whereas if they should have but
one head a piece (as they have three) could not yield less then three loades
of wood in a pole of sixteen years growing; worth to be sold two shillings
six pence the load, arises to ten pounds a year. The timber for paling
and workmanship yearly saved, which can not be less worth then six pounds,
(which timber is more then needful to he saved) besides the profit of the
browse for Decre) maste for hogs, and bark for the tanning of leather, which
would arise to be much worth, if the wood might grow until it be twenty or
four and twenty years old, which then would also yield many good sparres
for the building of outhouses and cottages, with good store of work for poor
laboring men, by lopping and faggoting the wood. This direction were very
profitable to be used about spring-woods when they fell their wood, and make
their hedges, so as it may be made once for ever to great profit. What reason
any man has to omit this, I leave to be censured by the discreet Reader.

For the increase of Firewood, by the Lopping of trees.
FOr the better increasing of wood by lopping of trees, experience will teach
all men to know, that will observe it, as he rides on the way in every
Country, especially in Cheshire, near unto the Wiches, (where salt is made,
and much wood is spent by the boiling thereof,) that every tree will as well
yield five or six heads, as one, if workmen, when they loppe trees, would
observe the directions before set down, for the topping and lopping of trees
about parks, and in hedges.

For the increasing of firewood in hedge-rowes, between decayed trees, the
best remedy is, that when such trees decay, and have lop-wood on them, of the
age of ten or twelve years, within a week of the first day of August, or
within a week after, when the sap is in the tops of the trees, to set a
discreet workman into the trees, and there with a sharp knife to cut off
close to the head of the trees, all the bark a hand broad that grows upon
the principal boughs that be likest to make trees, so clean that he leaves
not the breadth of a hair, but rather cut part of the wood then leave any of
the bark: This being done, presently get good clay, and let one work it to
the breadth and thickness of a tile, and so long, or longer, as it may well
lap about the bough so pared, then lay thereon some fat earth two or three
fingers thick, and lay the same clay and earth upon the bark of the bough
next to the plot so pared; and with moss and bands bind these same on, like
unto a graffe, and so let it rest, and about Alhollontide, then make holes in
the ground where you would have them to grow, and presently saw off with a
hand-saw the boughs so clayed, between the clay and the plot so pared, and so
do it as the earth be not shaken off, carry them, and set them half a yard
deep, fill up the holes with limed earth half a yard broad about the plant
and tread it well; if the ground be barren, make the holes so much the wider,
and fill them: Being so set, stake them, and bind them as other Sets, and
assuredly they will grow and prosper better then other Sets, or transplanted
trees: If they be set between trees, loppe the old trees before you set them,
that they be not ouer-topped, nor dropped by them: these being either elm,
willow, or sallow. As for other wood, I have seen no experience (but of some
boughs of Apple and Peare-trees, which being thus used, have borne fruit the
same year they were set,) I can find no reason to the contrary, but that
other woods may grow and prosper as well as these. This is the most speedy way
to beget woods.

All these Directions being observed, there may be in good time, more timber,
firewood, corn and catell contained in this kingdom, then has been at any
time these threescore years, and yet no woods at all: so that the soil of
all woods in time may be converted to tillage, meadow, or pasture, to the
profit of the Kings majesty, all Posterity, and the Commonwealth. The
kingdom thereby may be the better defended from foreign enemies by the
Navigations, the banks of the Seas, and ebbing and flowing rivers defended,
stays maintained; all which cannot be maintained but by wood, without which
defense a great part of the kingdom is in danger to be ouer-flowen and
ruinated: some proofs thereof were to be seen this year one thousand six
hundred and thirteen, near Blackewall, where was a Breach that has and will
cost two thousand pounds to recover it: And this winter, to the utter undoing
of many an able man, in many places of this kingdom: the charge of stays and
banks in many ebbing and flowing rivers, is chargeable to many, especially in
the river of Owes, where the maintaining of stays and banks costeth the
Bishop of Durham at the least a hundred marks a year, and is very chargeable
to sir Thomas Mettam; and all that have grounds there, that are charged
thereby, according to the proportion of their grounds. The decay of these
banks may in one tide drown much land, and many towns: which the observing
of these directions, and some other following, will prevent.

The wood that may be raised about parkes, and the hedges within this kingdom,
would raise many profits to the commonwealth, as the making of iron, and all
other kind of mettalls which the kingdom affoordeth, together with the
burning of lime for the manuring of land, and buildings, and burning of brick
and tile for building, with many other profits to the kingdom.

For the increasing of wood in the Springs of wood.
Whereas in springs I find many waste places grown over with grass, by
reason whereof, men covet to put in Calves and Horses, which are great spoils
to woods. The only way to furnish such places, especially in barren grounds,
which may best be spared for wood, until such time that the other woods be
grown up, is either when the Spring is five or six years grown, or when it
is felld, to dig up certain square yards, according to the spaciousness of
the ground, three yards between every plot, and therein to set, or lay in
trenches the aforesaid means, as is before set down; and when they are
grown up five or six years to plash them close by the ground, and lay them
in Trenches every way from the root three fingers deep, and to cover them
with earth, and so of all other wood that grows of old roots, so as there
may not be a waste place nor any thorns left to grow, but proouing wood.

As for other grounds that are worth twenty shillings an Acre yearly, (which
is too good for wood to grow on) but that the decay of wood is too great, I
could wish that it were stocked into rows, either for timber, or to top and
lop it for firewood.

And whereas it is required by the law, that there should be a certain number
of trees preserved for timber, which is by few men performed, the reason is,
that the dropping and shadow of them will destroy the underwood, which is most
true: my advice is, that rather the number of timber trees might be preserved
in some corner of the Spring, where they may be preserved from many dangers
which they are subject to, as they are left in the Springs.

Concerning the planting of wood in hedges already made with thorns.
SOme do object, that the planting of wood in them will so destroy the thorns
by the dropping and ouershadowing of them, as there will be no good fence kept.
To such I answer, that if they would the next year after that they cause a
hedge to be plashed, and the ditch thereunto belonging scoured, and some small
quantity of the earth cast up to the roots of the hedge; for too much earth so
cast to the roots of the hedge decay the hedge, and that they would set in the
same earth such means as is before set down, and so use them, they might at
any time after twenty years, have both good store of wood and thorns, and also
have a stronger fence then any thorns can make. The charge of the setting and
getting of the means in common reason can no way cost two shillings a furlong,
for two men will set at the least two furlongs a day, the one man to make holes
to set them in, and the other to put in the means, and cover it. The profit
that may arise thereby is before set down for the profit of parkes.

Concerning such as hereafter may enclose.
IS to enclose with the aforesaid means, and not with thorns, whereby with
less charge and labor they may raise a fence stronger and longer lasting,
with greater profit, by the setting of the aforesaid means, on the top of the
banks, as is set down for Parkes, which (by experience) will grow more
speedily then thorns, and make a better fence, (as is proved) that will with
a good Gate, Lock, and Key, keep all Cattle safe from stealing, and from
breaking into any other grounds then the owner would have them, safe from
trespassing to his neighbor, or his neighbors to him; whereby much corn may
be saved, trespassing prevented (which too often raises envy, and suites in
Law.) The browse of the wood in winter will greatly relieve cattle, and save
fodder: And being wood that will yield maste, the maste will be very
beneficial to the particular Owner, and Commonwealth.

Directions for such as are desirous to stock up woods, for the improouing of
the Soil.
BY converting of the same to corn, meadow, or pasture, and to have as much, or
rather more profit by the woods, then they had before; is, first, to leave a
yard in breadth round about the sides, for the maintaining of the fence, which
may be made once for all, by observing the aforesaid directions: Then begin
at a side next to the wood so left, and stock up all the wood whatsoever, so
as the ground may be plowed ten yards in breadth, and in the eleventh yard
stock up all but fifty five of the best trees, which trees would (as near as
may be) be so left, that they may grow four yards distant one from another,
from end to end, as trees planted in an orchard: and so stock up from side to
side, and from end to end, leaving the like distance, so as there may be ten
yards distance one way, and four an other from tree to tree: by which means,
in every two rows, there may be left an hundred and ten trees out of every
Acre, how great or little soever the ground be: which being topped, and after
twelve years lopped, with many heads (as they may be by the directions already
set down, or rather for a greater profit, left vnlopped till the wood be of
twenty years growth) the profit thereof, by the greatness of the wood, and the
bark, with the profit of the wood that may arise about the fence (being made
as before is directed) will far exceed the profit of the underwood growing
of all the ground before.

But as the case stands, and as is more like to stand, by the want of timber,
if all the trees were left for timber, and never topped nor lopped, would, in
time, arise to the greater profit; especially if they were every third year
shread in March, when the sap is rising up, and the wood worth the
shreadding, which sap would so grow, as it would cover the knottes, by which
means the trees will grow taper-like, with so small tops, as the ground
between the rows may be plowed three years, and may be laid to grass for
nine years; so may you have from time to time three years good corn, and
nine years good grass, and never to decay the land, but rather to improve it.
The trees being thus kept with small tops, can neither hurt corn or grass,
by dropping or shadow.

Some do object and say, that if all Spring-woods were so stocked, how should
hurdles be gotten for the folding of sheep? To which I answer with experience,
where wood is not lopped too young, some of the greatest boughs being lopped
and barked, and then laid in water a month, they will be so rated, and grow
so hard, as worms can no way hurt them: and being so used, will make far
better and stronger hurdles, then any young rods whatsoever, as may appear in
many Countries of this kingdom where wood is so scant, as they are of
necessity constrained to use willow boughs for spars and laths for many houses,
and to use them about ploughs, carts, and harrowes.

Others do object, that the grass in such woody grounds will be so sour as
cattle will not like of it. To that I answer, that if the rows be planted East
and Weast, or so stocked, as the ground between the rows may have the
morning, noon and evening Sun, the pasture will be as sweet as any other: the
corn will as well like of it as of any other ground, and will as well dry
when it is cut, or if the cattle be put into such grounds before they taste
of a sweeter grass, they will like as well of that grass as of any other. And
for the better proof thereof: Who ever saw grass lost for the eating, in any
forest, chase or park, where trees grow thick, notwithstanding the cattle
in such grounds, (if they be not eaten too bare) like very well, by reason of
the shadow in Summer, and shelter in Winter.

A further experience may be taken, to encourage all men hereunto, from about
thousands of towns in this kingdom, where are to be seen little closes, of
two, three, four or five acres of ground, as have so much timber or firewood
growing about them, as if it were at this instant to be sold, would give more
money then the fee-simple of the land. Whereupon it follows, very fittingly
for this purpose, to show what good may arise to the particular owners of
ground, by observing these directions set down in sundry places for these
purposes, and how the kingdom may be improoued, only by wood planted about
Parkes, and in Hedges made, and hereafter to be made of wood, so far from
the loss of any, as it may be to the general good of all men, even to the
very poorest, whose relief I greatly desire.

And for my further experience, I saw about Christmas last, a close of sandy
Land of four Acres, taken in the midst of a field belonging to Downam in
Norffolke, about forty years ago, and set round about when it was taken in,
with young sets, (as it was confessed to me by the Owner thereof) of Ash,
roots of Elm, and Thorns, and the most part of the stakes of the Hedge, were
of Willow and Sallow, which Stakes and Settes of Wood did so take root, as
upon my credit there is growing about the said close five hundred fifty and
odd trees, of the aforesaid wood, whereof the Owner confessed unto me that
he did every year loppe five and fifty of ten years growing, the which
wood he could yearly sell for forty shillings, and the four Acres of ground
he could not let for above six and twenty shillings and eight pence yearly:
So that I do find by experience, that the most sure way to perform this
planting, is to make nurseries, which may be kept from Mice by trappes.

And that the simplest may the better understand it, admit for this purpose,
that a man have six score Acres of ground in his own occupation, and that it
were equally divided into twelve Closes, and that but half the Fences about
those twelve Closes did belong unto them, by reason that they are joining to
other men's Closes, (as commonly all enclosed grounds are) there remains to
every of those Closes, an end, and a side, at the least, of the Fence, which
contain two furlongs, which is foure-score poles to a Close; all which hedges
being planted, according to the directions set down for hedges, there will
arise about these twelve Closes four and twenty furlongs, whereby the Owner of
those Closes, may after thirty years, loppe yearly the wood about one Close,
being two furlongs, or one furlong of four and twenty years growth; which is
the greater profit by much, by reason that the wood being grown so great, it
would yield sparres for the building of barnes, stables, cottages, and such
like straw-thatched houses, with good store of Bark for the tanning of
leather, with a greater plenty of Maste, then being lopped younger, it would
yield, with many other profits to the Owner thereof, and to the good of the
Commonwealth.

The Maste that may arise by this general planting, will save more corn (in
those years that it takes) then the wit of man can imagine it to be worth. A
late experience thereof may be taken from the year of our Lord one thousand
six hundred and eleven, by the Maste that the small quantity of wood that is
left, yielded that year: which Maste fed so many hogs that year, as it
greatly eased the prises of corn, and other victuals. For the better proof
thereof, it is certain, upon confident report of several honest men, that
there was saved (by Maste) in some one town in Leichestershire, forty quarters
of beans and pease; and in some towns more, and in some less: which hogs
were driven into Shropshire to Maste, which in former Ages was a common course,
before woods were destroyed, for the champaine Countries, to feed their hogs
in wood-land countries: In which times the Officers of Noblemen and Gentlemen
took twenty or thirty pounds a year, for the feeding of hogs in a Park, or
in a Wood, which hardly now take five pounds; and in many Parkes or Woods, not
one penny, the woods are so made away.

So (to conclude) he that observes the aforesaid directions about the twelve
Closes, may yearly loppe eight score load of wood, of twelve years growing,
worth to be sold at two shillings six pence the load, twenty pounds, and
much more, if the closes be less. Whereby it appears, that all Grounds
enclosed, and that hereafter may be enclosed, may be improoued three shillings
and four pence an Acre yearly.

A second Direction, for the present increasing of Firewood, agreeable to the
nature of this Age, 1613. February 1.
HEaring daily, shat this more then necessary business is much desired to be
effected, the subjects thereof much commended, and the daily destruction of
woods greatly complained of. In respect that so many, contrary to the Law for
preserving of wood, and his Majesty's earnest and daily dersire for the
planting and preserving thereof, notwithstanding do so stock up, and other
ways destroy woods, as it is generally feared by many good men, that in short
time, there will be neither timber nor firewood left for any use. And finding
one of the greatest hindrances to this business, to be the nature of this
Age, that men may not endure to tarry so long for profit, till timber may be
raised: in regard thereof, still hoping that I am animated by God, who is the
Author of all things that good is, and as it does appear by the Kings most
excellent Majesty, and induced by many good men by several means, I have by
diligent observing what I hear, and the experience that I daily see (and is to
be seen, by as many as will be mindful thereof) I have herein set down such
profitable directions, as already has moved some, and I hope hereafter will
move all men to the observing of them, both for timber and firewood.

In respect that it will appear, that there is not many devices to improve
grounds, to so present and continual profit clear, all charges defrayed, and
for the better understanding thereof, as before, so here; I do give further
knowledge to all men for this purpose, that there is contained in a Statute
Acre of land 4840. square yards of ground, the length thereof 220. yards, the
breadth 22. which is 66. foot, admit for this purpose, and after that rate for
more or less, as men are disposed, either for their own use, or for sale,
that a man would enclose eight Acres of earable fieldland (or plant in a close
of eight Acres already enclosed) the land being of the yearly value of five
shillings an Acre, or not above a noble, where the soil is two foot deep or
less, or of any commons, heaths or downs. First, to the principal point
(without the which, and for want thereof, many good beginnings end in nothing)
this ground must be first ditched on either side before Allhollantide, with a
ditch two yards broad at the top, a yard and half deep, and a foot broad, or
less in the bottom, which ditch sides and ends will take something more then
the third part of an Acre. The side ditches being made as before, begin and
measure from the edge of the ditch in the inside of the close twelve foot in
breadth into the close-ward, and plow up two furrows along from end to end by
the earth, cast forth of the ditch as straight as may be, one, one way, the
other, the other way, (plow clean, but not deep) still plow up two surrowes,
and leave two foot vnplowed, till it be so plowed within two and twenty yards
of the other side, and so leave that two and twenty yards to plant the means
for to raise timber, if the Owner please, if not, plow on till all be plowed to
the earth, cast forth of the other ditch, and at Candlemasse plow in the two
furrows again very deep, so as they may lie as little ridges full two foot
broad on the top, and two foot between every ridge, then presently ditch up
the ends as the sides, and leave one gate-stead for carts or waines, to pass
into the woods, and between Michaelmasse and Allhollantide, when Akornes,
Chestnuts, and Beech-maste is ripe, gather them as they fall from the trees, for
being beaten down before, they cannot so well grow and prosper; and it is one
special cause where many is sown or set, and so few come to perfection, if
the soil be best for Elm, then the chips or roots of Elm, but specially the
roots, being set as quick for timber, but not for underwood.

These masts must be got and kept dry in tubs in the ground, with some very
dry sand so put among them, as some sand may be between every of them, some
do make holes in dry ground, and keep them therein, being well covered, to
keep them dry, and so keep them till mid-March, that corn is in sowing in
the fields, and the mice returned to fields (which mice this year, by
experience, I find to be the greatest enemy to the increasing of wood that is,
for this year they have eaten Akornes that were lapt in hair and tar) and
then set, sow, and use them, according to the directions.

The Ash-keyes and Sekamore seeds, may be pulled or beaten down when they are
ripe and dry, and kept on heaps on boorded floores, they must be turned over
sometimes, else they will mold, and in like sort sow them in March, and begin
and sow them all over the earth, cast forth of the ditch, round about the
close, and all over every ridge, as thick as Beans, and harrow them in, or
rather cover them with an yron-toothed rake.

And further, to furnish up the rows so plowed, and the banks, there must be
also got immediately after the Lady day, or before, as the Spring time falls
forth, so as they may be set before the leaves put forth, when the most sap is
in them fifteen score willow or sallow setts of ten foot long of the freshest
and greenest, which must be carefully carried for bruising of the bark, forth
of every set of that length there may be cut six sets of half a yard long, cut
colt-footed at both ends, which must be set in the midst of the ridges, where
the Ash keys are sown two yards asunder one from an other, from end to end,
fourteen inches deep, and four inches above ground. The holes wherein they
are to be set, must be made with a spade, full fourteen inches deep, two
foot wide, the setts being put into the holes so deep, the less earth must be
put in, but neither stones nor grass, and trodden close to the sets, being thus
set, how can they in common reason fail but grow? for every deaw that falls
will nourish them, and keep them so moist, as they will grow more in two
years, then an ordinary long set will do in three, and the Ash-keyes will
grow so thick, as they will keep the ground continually moist. There must be
also set in like sort two rows of willow and sallow between the edge of the
ditch, and the first ridge, the one four foot off the first ridge, the other
four foot off that, and so on the other bank of the other side, if it be not
planted for timber, by which means there may be contained sixteen rows in
every acre, and in every row a hundred and ten willow and sallow plants, which
in June after they be 3 years old, all the under boughs must be cut away,
and only four left of every root of the straitest and tallest, the
vnder-boughes will be springes and rods for Thechars, and the worst good fuel
for baking and brewing, which will be more worth then the labor.

The number of willow and sallow poles, being four of every root, is seven
thousand and forty, and when the Ash and Sekamores are three years old, they
must be all drawn up, and only ten of the Ashes left to grow a foot from
every willow or sallow, a foot asunder one from an other every way in the
rows, and at the ends and sides all must be drawn up, and only three rows
left to grow upon a foot and a half of ground upon the ditch banks, round
about the close for a fence, half a foot off the hedge of the bank, and
half a foot asunder one from another every way, not so close as they may grow
directly one against an other, but so as they may fulfill the open places of
each other in the rows, and as they grow great, that one row may be the fence,
the other rows may be felld in June, so as they may grow no more, and those
that do remain for the fence must be topped when they are grown so high as
the bodies may be five yeards high from the ground, and so to stand as pales,
which will be as strong a fence as any wall, being thus topped, they would be
lopped after five years growth, before the wood be too high for shaking them
loose at the roots by wind, and afterward at every ten years, being
lopped, as before is directed, will yield every ten years, at the least, three
load of wood of a pole. The young Ashes and Sekamores that are to be drawn
up, must be drawn in the new of the moon, the wind being South or West, and
presently set, the tops of the Ashes being cut off as quick, and set in the
bottom of thorn hedges, half a foot asunder, which being defended by the
thorns, will be in a few years a very profitable and an everlasting fence, or
being set under bushes that may defend them, will soon grow to be trees; or
being set as quick where men do enclose, will sooner be a fence then thorns,
and raise more profit by many degrees, as does appear, and more easily may be
conceived.

The number of the ash poles in seven acres is seventeen thousand and six
hundred, the total of all the poles contained in one acre, is four and twenty
thousand six hundred and forty, rated at six pence the score, when they are
seven years old, arise to thirty pounds, sixeteene shillings an acre every
seven years, at the least (over and above the wood that will arise about the
fence, every willow and sallow set was worth a penny forty years since, and
three poles will make two better faggots then ever were sold in London for pence
a piece these fifty years, the tops of the poles will make good bauins, more
worth then all the workmanship, and by other means there may be more made.

This wood must be all felld and carried off the ground before the end of
March, for hindering the Spring. The eight acre may be all plowed from end to
end into one land, leaving a yard of either side, one from the ditch, the other
from the last ridge of that side, then begin at either side of that acre, a
yard off that end, where the gate is not to be set, and set a yard, as before
is directed for timber, and so set from end to end, and from side to side all
that acre, always leaving one yard every way, and set an other, by which means
there may be raised in that one acre twelve hundred and ten trees for timber,
every tree to have four yards of ground to grow on: if they grow too thick,
it is easier to take some away, then to put more to, which being kept (as
before) will grow clean without knots taper-like, with so small tops, as if
they should grow in rows, they will never hurt wood or corn by shadow or
dropping.

And if the owner of the ground list to raise more Ash plants, all the whole
close may be plowed and sown with keys or other means, and raked in. Many
there are that desire to raise wood by a very unprofitable course, by remoouing
young trees from the ground where they grow and prosper, and sets them again
where 10 of 20 never grow: the special reasons, are in respect that they are
either removed unto a worse soil, or too long unset after they are taken up,
or not set with the same side to the Sun that was before, or not being taken
up in due time, about the midst of September, before the sap be returned to
the root (for as trees grow upward in Summer, so do trees grow in the roots
in winter) or not liking, grow hide-bound; the help to that is, to slitte them
from top to root four slitts in the bark, in April, the wind being west
or south) or set deeper then before, or not maintained with stakes and bushes,
to preserve them from wind and cattle, or being when they are new set, stolen
or shaken loose at the roots, by the poor that intend to steal them; And
many there be that are very desirous to plant, and some that would preserve
that which is planted, are discouraged by the poor that do cut it forth of the
springs, break their hedges, and every way spoil and steal; whereupon
arises a great grieuance between such as have wood, and the poor: the one
will have it, (as they say) although they die for it; the other will destroy
it, though they and their posterity repent it: the only remedy is, a general
plantation.

If the whole kingdom were to be enclosed, by the sowing of these grounds all
over with the aforesaid maste and seeds of wood (but not of sykamore, for they
will not prove so well after they are cut, as other wood) they must be set
with the tops) there would be sets enough soon gotten, to enclose all; and if
a third part of all the ground enclosed, and hereafter to be enclosed, were
continually kept in tillage, it would be the greatest benefit to the King and
kingdom that can be devised, there would be more corn, bieues, muttons,
butter and cheese, by many degrees, then there is, and much more work for
laboring men: and for firewood, timber, and corn, we should exceed all
Nations; some scantling may be taken thereof in every county of this kingdom,
where the barest grounds enclosed do (in profit) far exceed the best
valleys; the people much the richer, and abler of body to serve their Prince,
and defend their country, and the kingdom securer from invasion then
champaine countries: The Ash and Sykamore sets that may be raised forth of
every Acre, will pay for the willow and sallow sets.

If any would plant low grounds, the willow and sallow setts must be so long,
as the water may seldom or not at all stand over the heads of the sets; in
such grounds they may be set but a yard asunder, so as there may be raised
four thousand eight hundred and forty plants, but not any otherwood: if the
vnderboughes, (as before) be cut away, and only four left at the first
felling: afterward, as the roots grow broader, there may be more left. The
taking away of the vnder-boughes will greatly improoue the rest. And whereas
some make doubt, that willow and sallow will not grow upon dry ground, or on
any soil. Believe it, I write no untruth, nor no more then I have seen, and
know to be true: and to make some proof thereof, Master Thomas Spencer of
Clardon in Warwickeshire, a man known to many, showed me about
Bartholomewtide, in the year of our Lord, one thousand six hundred and twelve,
being the driest spring that year that was of many years before, or since,
many hundreds of sallow or willow setts, that he had caused to be set the
same year, which sets are not above a foot long above ground, set in bare,
dry, grauelly, hungry ground; notwithstanding the drienesse of the year,
there were very few that took not; and the rest had so taken root, as they
put forth at the roots, by the moistness of the deaws, but not at the tops:
and he himself told me in Candlemasse Term, one thousand six hundred and
thirteen, when this Book was in Printing, that they took at the ground, and
prospered well: he further told me, that of his own knowledge, the seed of
willow would grow. And it has been reported to me by men of good worth, that
the chippes of willow will grow; which I do the better believe; for I have
often seen the chippes of poplar, aspe, and awbell grow, so as they would not
be destroyed but by plucking them up by the roots; for of all wood, cattle
will least browse of those woods. And further, that willow and sallow will grow
on any ground, having two foot soil, it is to be seen by as many as will
observe it, that in all chalkie, flinty, sandy, or any other dry ground, they
will grow from hedge-stakes. And I have seen, and it is to be seen, as great
sallow and willow trees come of stakes, as may be seen in any low grounds,
both sounder and longer lasting by many degrees, for all will put forth so
near the ground, as I do write, and in woods on the driest ground that is;
there is no wood comparable to those woods in growth, but Ash: for chips of
Elm, I have seen many trees of them. And for the better proof thereof, sir
Thomas Tresham of Newton in Northamptonshire showed me the last Summer, at the
least a dozen trees, that of his own knowledge came of chips. And about
Michaelmasse last, it pleased the Earl of Kent to inuit me to dine with him
in Bedford, where there was at least seven or eight Knights and Esquires at the
Table, some of which doubted of the growing of the chips of Elm; whereunto
master Lee a Justice of Peace, dwelling within half a mile of Bedford
affirmed, saying, they would grow; for he caused an Elm to be felld at the
Spring of the year, and to be carried to his house, into a yard where no
cattle came, and where the Elm was squared, and the chippes clean raked off:
notwithstanding, many of the smallest that remained, sprung up as thick as
hemp seed on a land: and other proofs I could make, if occasion served: as for
the roots or boughs, I have heard no doubt made of them, neither can any make
doubt of the growing of the maste or seeds of any other wood. And for any wood
to grow so thick, it is less to be doubted, for in Cambridgeshire, where most
springs of Elm are, it is to be seen, that after the underlings be cut away,
they grow as thick as I write of, where they are left so thick, as for Ash or
any other seeds of wood, it will (for so few or more years) grow so thick:
And I have seen many Groves of Ash that have been set, that after many years
have taken hold, and grown so thick. The last Summer, about Michaelmasse, it
pleased sir Walter Montague to show me a Grove by his house, within five miles
of Northampton, which he had caused to be set not much thinner; in which Grove
he had caused some to be felled that liked not, which forth of the roots of
such as were felled, there were young Ashes sprung up, of a yard and three
quarters high, of one years growth. And I have seen the like in many places:
the only way to make young trees after they are removed, to grow more in one
year, then after they are moved, in three, is to fell them by the ground,
after two years, when they have taken root. If any shall ask why wood does
not prove so well by many degrees: In all springs of wood, I answer, there are
two reasons at the least why it does not, the one is, no wood grows so
speedily, by the half, as these woods; but the special reason is the Springs,
are not ordered, they are fuller of hasell, maple-bushes, and other wood that
rises to small proof, and so thick of underlings, as the other can not
generally prosper, but some few that get up and choke all the rest. Neither is
the sixth part of any springs that I see furnished with such proouing wood. And
for further proof for timber, one master Skipwith in Norffolke, within three
miles of Downane showed me a Grove, planted by his father, of four and
thirty years growth, of Oaks and Ash, grown so tall, as Herons have bred
in them these three years past: which trees grow not above two yards one from
another, some planted by akornes, and Ashe-keyes, and some by young sets, cut
and used as quick: some difference there is of their growth, the setts are the
taller, but little the bigger. All these kinds of planting, by common reason
and experience cannot be denied, nor the profit thereof: by reason thereof it
may appear, that whereas there is contained in this kingdom five and twenty
millions of Acres whereupon wood will grow and prosper, over and above the
waste whereon wood will not prove, if it were planted, as on stony hills,
great moorish, linggy moors and mosses, waters and watery moorish fennes and
highways: forth of which five and twenty millions take but one hundred
thousand acres, and divide it into ten thousand parts, it will yield to
every parish in this Kingdom, if there were ten thousand (as there is not)
two thousand five hundred acres; take forth of the two thousand five hundred,
but one hundred and ten Acres, and plant ten Acres thereof in rows, as
before is directed, and there may be raised in ten Acres of the hundred and
ten, four and twenty thousand two hundred trees for timber, two yards between
every one of them one way, and ten the other, to furnish every parish, and the
ground thereby much improued, and within thirty years the fences of all
grounds, being made, as before, will yield such store of firewood, as there
will be no need of the aforesaid plantation, for firewood, or any other
springs, but all may be stocked up and converted to tillage and pasture. For
the better effecting of this business, it is thought convenient, that an Act
might pass, that it may be lawful for all men to enclose, ground for this
plantation in common fields, and many towns may be furnished by their commons.

So as if coals should decay near the coasts (as they do too fast in many
places within the Land) which as yet is no more feared, then the want of wood
was generally feared through the whole Kingdom, specially in London, Cambridge
and Oxford, forty years ago, when the porest sort scorned to eat a piece of
meat roasted with sea-coles, which now the best Magistrates are constrained to
do. If a man in that time should have foretold this want of wood, that now
the whole Kingdom is come to, it would have been holden a thing impossible,
the plenty of wood was then so great, and so good means to continue the same:
with much more reason may it now be feared, that in the like time coals may be
more decayed, considering the abundance that is spent of them, not only in
this Realm, but in other Nations, and no means to increase them: for by
experience it is generally known, that after they be once got, they never more
grow or increase.

And briefly to show the premises, first, that one thousand two hundred and
ten trees may be planted for timber in one acre, and every tree to have four
yards of ground to grow on, it is not to be doubted, for there is to be seen
in every county some groves that have been planted by the plough, and some by
hand within three score years, that grow as thick both of Oak and Ash, and
naturally groves of Elm and Which trees.

And that timber trees will grow and thrive well in rows, being two yards
asunder one way, and ten the other, it is also to be seen in every county
about many closes, and on all soiles, either Oak, Ash, Beech, or Elm that do
grow, specially in towns, by the highways sides, trees that are a hundred or
two hundred years old, planted or preserved, when wood was not of the worth
that it is in this instant, which in this age is thought impossible to be so
raised: nay, which is more strange, as great husbands as we think our selves,
it is apparent in every town, men choose rather to make dead hedges every
year, then to plant, as they may do by wood, and make a fence for hundreds of
years, as may appear by the wood already growing in such fences, which will
yield yearly profit, and prevent the great complaints that are daily made of
the poor for the breaking of hedges. And that all fences may be made of trees
only, it is evident, especially about woods, where in the hedges there is want
of thorns, they plash wood, which has lain, in common reason, as it does
appear by the greatness of the trees, at the least, a hundred years, and
grown so close as no man can see between the trees, being plashed, and for the
most part, laid so low as beasts browse off the tops, much more will they last
many more years, being laid, and not cut at the roots to receive water, the
tops being laid so high as cattle cannot reach them, or being vnlayed, may
grow upright, to stand as pales, which may be lopped for firewood, and browse
for Dear or Cattle. Thus much for fences of Parkes and other enclosed
grounds, and that this kind of firewood may be planted so thick and prove
so well, it may appear in all coppies, or springs of wood, that on Ash or
Sallow roots they grow thicker then I proportion; and all men know that willow
and sallow is inferior to no wood in growth, especially being planted so near
the ground. The reason why all spring woods make not such proof, is, that some
springs stand, for the most part, of beech, some with oak, some with
hornebeane, and many with maple, hasell and thorns, all which are no proouing
wood for fire. I never met with any but they approve, that Ash, Sallow, or
Willow, does grow more in one year, then any of the aforesaid woods will grow
in two: and Elm and Which is not much inferior to the Ash in growth; so it is
apparent, that if all men would furnish their springs with those kinds of wood,
and cut away all the underlings at 3 years growth, when the wood will be worth
the labor, no man would stock or grub up woods, as they do, except it were
into rows; and that all those kinds of woods will grow and prosper being
preserved and maintained, no man will make doubt, in regard that both reason
and experience makes proof thereof, and where those kinds of wood grow not so
thick; approuedly some being plashed from the roots of them that grow, being
shread, and a little of the tops cut off, and laid three fingers deep in
trenches, and covered with earth, will grow and prosper. And that every bush
will breed a tree (the means being set rather of a young plant that may be
raised by nurseries, then by the other means before set down, in regard that
I find all kind of maste subject to mice and other vermin. It is apparent in
all forests, chases, parkes, and commons, enclosed grounds, hedges and
highways sides, by the bushes that grow about many trees, both old and young;
and many there be that confess all this to be true by experience, that little
observe their own experience. Thus by his Majesty's favor and bounty, together
with the bounty and good instructions that I received from the worthy
Commonwealths men: I hold my self bound in conscience, not only to seek
all experience that may tend to this business, but likewise to put all men in
mind thereof, to the end that if Sea-coles shall decay, good take-heede come
not too late.

The Premises considered, it is generally hoped, that some good course will be
taken, to prevent so great an inconvenience. Thus with an honest intention, for
the public good of this kingdom, the content of his Majesty, and all good
men, I conclude, leaving the success to GOD, who is the director of men's hearts
to all good offices.

FINIS.
