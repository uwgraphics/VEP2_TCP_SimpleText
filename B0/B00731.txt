A pleasant new Song betwixt the Saylor and his Love.
To the tune of Dulcina.




What does aile my Love, so sadly
in such heavy dumps to stand?
Does she grieve or take unkindly,
that I am so near at hand?
Or does she vow,
she will not know,
Nor speak to me when I do come,
If that be so,
Away I Will go:
First kiss, and bid me welcome home.
Had I ever thee forsaken,
putting thee out of my mind,
Thou then might have justly spoken,
that I was to thee unkind;
Or should I take
Some other mate,
Then might thou have just cause to mourn:
But let me dye,
Before that I
Do so, then bid me welcome home.
Sooner shall the grass leave growing,
from the Hare the Hound shall run;
Husbandmen shall leave their sowing,
floods shall run the land upon,
The fish shall fly,
The Sea run dry.
The Birds no more shall sing, but mourn,
Ere I of thee
Unmindful be:
Then kiss, and bid me welcome home.
Smile on me, be not offended,
pardon grant for my amiss:
Let thy favor so befriend me,
as to seal it with a kiss.
To me I swear,
Thou art so dear,
That for thy sake I Will fancy none;
Then do not frown,
But sit thee down,
Sweet, kiss and bid me welcome home.
If thou have proved chaste Diana,
since from thee I did depart,
I as constant have been to thee,
for on thee fixed was my heart,
No not for she*
Jupiter see,
Danae in her Tower alone,
Should me entice,
No, I Will be nice,
Then kiss, and bid me welcome home,
No nor Venus, Cupids mother,
nor the fairest wife of Jove,
Should Lucrecia or some other
seek by gifts to win my love,
Should Hellen fair,
To me repair,
And unto me for love make moan,
Yet none of these
My mind shall please,
Then kiss, and bid me welcome home.

The second part.
To the same Tune.




FRom thy sight though I was banished,
yet I always was to thee,
Far more kind then was Ulysses,
to his chaste Penelope:
For why away
He once did stay
Ten years and left her all alone,
But I from thee,
Have not bin three,
Sweet, kiss and bid me welcome home.
Come sweet heart, come sit down by me
and let thy lap my pillow be,
While sweet sleep my mind beguileth,
all my dreams shall be on thee.
I pray thee stay,
steal not away
Let lullaby be all my song;
With kisses sweet,
Lull me asleep,
And say, sweetheart you are welcome home

The woman's answer. I have bin sad to see how from me,
thou so long from me did stay,
Yet now I more rejoice to see thee,
happily arrived this day.
Thou from our shore
shall go no more,
To wander thus abroad alone,
But thou shall stay,
With me always,
For here is my hand you are welcome home.
I have proved Diana to thee,
since from me thou wentst away,
I have had suitors well nigh twenty,
and much ado had for to stay:
But I denied,
When they replied,
And sent them all away in scorn,
For I had sworn,
To live forlorn,
Until that I see thee come home.
Seeing thou art home arrived*
thou shall not go away in haste*
But lovingly come sit down by me,
let thine arms embrace my waste*
Farewell annoy.
Welcome my Joy;
Now lullaby is all my song,
For now my heart,
Sings loath to part,
Then kiss, sweetheart, you are welcome ^^me,
Since sweetheart, thou do befrie^^ me
thus to take me to thy love.
Never more will I offend thee,
but will ever constant prove,
Thou have my heart
Not to depart,
But ever constant to remain,
And thou have mine,
And I am thine,
Then let us kiss and welcome home.

FINIS.
