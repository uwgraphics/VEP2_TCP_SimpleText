The West-Country Lawyer OR, The Witty Maid's Good Fortune;
Who wisely maintained her Virginity against the Golden Assaults of the Lawyer,
who at length Married her to her hearts Content.

To the Tune of the Baffled Knight,




A Youthful Lawyer fine and gay
was Riding unto the City,
Who met a Damsel on the way,
right beautiful, fair and witty.
Good morrow then the Lawyer cried
I prithee where art thou going,
Quoth she, to yonder Meadows side,
my father is there a Mowing.
Straight from his Horse he did alight
and as he was going to her,
The Maid immediately took flight,
for fear he would undo her,
But he run like a Nimble Deer,
until he did overtake her;
And then he would whispered in her Ear,
a Lady he surely make her,
If he might but enjoy the Bliss,
a min^uit or two of Pleasure;
Then as a Pledge I Will give thee this,
a handful of Golden Treasure.
Said she, I value not your Gold.
and therefore I pray be civil,
My Maidens-head shall never be Sold
for Moneys the root of all evil.
I Would sooner be a Ploughs-mans Bride,
and sit at my Wheel a Spinning:
Than be a Lawyer's Ilt. she cried,
to live by the Trade of Sinning.
Tush, said the Lawyer be not coy,
let us fall to our Loves Embraces
A Silken Gown thou shall enjoy,
with Bracelets, Rings and Laces,
your Silken Gown I do disdain,
although I have mean Relation,
I am resolved to maintain
my Innocent Reputation.
If thou will but to London go
I Will honor the like a Lady,
But still the damsel answered no
I am happy enough already.
You talk of Glory State and Fame,
and how I shall be attended;
But Sir I am not for your Game,
so let the Discourse be ended.
Pray save your Breath and Money too,
I like not your way of Wooing
There is too many suc^ ^s you
that brings the young Maids to Ruin.
I Will keep my pure Virginity,
till Marraige is my Pleasure:
For Sir said she it is more to me
Then Millions of Gold and Treasure
He found her so discreet and wise,
in every ready Answer,
That he her Charms did highly prize.
and vowed he would soon advance her,
Unto her Parents he did go,
where he did their Love require:
Then was she clothed from top to Toe,
in costly Rich Attire.
Next day the Gordian Knot was tied,
and many was at the Marriage:
Then she appeared an Angel bright,
for Beauty and comely Carriage.
you Lasses all I pray you mind,
to whom I have told this Story,
Be careful that you a'not too kind,
for fear you should blast your Glory,
Had she been soon to Folly lead,
and for a small Spell Consented,
She might have lost her Maidens-head,
and when it was gone Lamented.
But now she is a Lawyers Wife,
her Husband does dearly Love her,
So that she leads a happy Life,
there is few in the Town above her.
FINIS.
