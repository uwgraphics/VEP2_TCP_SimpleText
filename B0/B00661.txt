Cum Privilegio Regiae Majestatis.

Act anent choosing of Pedagoges to children passing fourth of Scotland to
schools.
FOrasmuch as our Sovereign Lord and Estates of this present Parliament
Considering that one of the great causses which hes procured the grouth and
increase of Papists within this kingdom hes proceeded from the small care and
regard that hes been had of the education and vpbringing of the youth, who
being sent forth of the realm to places of contrary profession, and not being
first well grounded in religion, and accompanied with Pedagoges scarce well
affected to religion, they do often return back so possessed with superstition
and heretical errors, as they may be justly suspected for dangerous subjects
in the estate. For preventing of which grouth and increase of defection from
the true faith by the occasion foresaid, Our said Sovereign Lord and Estates
foresaids, Ordaines that all such Noble men and others who hereafter shall
direct any Pedagoges with their sons out of the country, shall be holden by
vertew of this present Act, to have a sufficient testimonial of the Bishop of
the diocie where the said Pedagoge for the most part lately before made his
residence: Testifying and approouing the said Pedagoge to be godly and of good
religion, learned and instructed in the same. And if any Nole man or other
shall happen to send any Pedagoge with their sons out of the country
without the testimonial and approbation of the Bishop in manner above written,
In that case our said Sovereign Lord and Estates foresaids Declares, statutes
and ordaines that every such Noble man and others according to their several
degrees and ranks shall incur the pains particularly underwritten, viz.
every Earl five thousand pounds, every Lord five thousand marks, and every
barron three thousand marks; which sums shall be intrometted with and vplifted
of them by his Majesty's Thesaurer and his depute to his Highness use: Providing
incace it shall happen the Bishop of that diocie to refuse to grant testimonial
to the Pedagoge upon the premises, the said Bishop thereafter being lawfully
summoned to compeere before the Lords of his Highness Secreete Counsel to
answer to that complaint, and show not a reasonable cause of that his
refusal, Than and in that case, it shall be lawful to the Lords of secreet
Counsel to give their testimonial to the foresaid Pedagoge, to the effect
above written.

Act against children that becomes papists when they are out of Scotland.
Our Sovereign Lord and Estates of this present Parliament Ordaines the
Noblemen, Barons and others to have a special care and to give order and
direction that the remaining of their sons forth of the country shall be in
places where Religion is professed, or at the least where there is no restraint
of the same by the cruelty of Inquisition: and that during the time of their
absence they shall not haunt any idolatrous exercise of religion, And that such
persons as hes not the moyen to intertaine with their sons a Pedagoge shall
send them to such places where religion is professed. And incace their sons
after their departure out of the country shall haunt the exercises of
contrary religion, Our said Sovereign Lord and Estates foresaids ordain that
their parents or such others as hes the charge of them shall be straited to
find caution acted in the books of secreet Counsel under such pains as shall
be modified, that they shall not supply, intertaine nor furnish them with any
thing necessare or comfortable unto them after that it be known that their
sons are become papists and haunts Idolatry contrary to the religion
presently professed within Scotland, except their reasonable expensses in
recalling and bringing them to this Realm of Scotland.

Act anent excommunicate persons not to enjoy their lands, rowmes and
possessions.
Our Sovereign Lord and Estates of this present Parliament Considering that
whereas there is diverse persons who are excommunicate for not conforming
themselves to the true religion presently professed, and do notwithstanding
still enjoy the possessions of their lands, rents and living* either directly
in their own persons or covertlie in the persons of their friends and
wel-willers to their use and behoof, to the couraging of them to persist in
their pernicious and erroneous opinions, and to the frustrating of the
execution of the acts and constitutions made against excommunicants heretofore.
Therefore our said Sovereign Lord and Estates foresaids Declares, statutes and
ordaines That no persons whatsoever who are already or hereafter shall happen
to be excommunicate for not conforming themselves to the Religion presently
professed within this kingdom, shall be suffered either directly in their own
persons, or covertlie and indirectlie by any others in their names and to their
behoose, enjoy the possession of their lands, rents and revenewes, But that the
same shall be meddled with, intrometted with and vplifted to his Majesty's use.

Act giving command to Bishops to send the names of excommunicate persons to
the Thesaurer and to the Director of the Chancellarie.
OUR Sovereign Lord and Estates of this Present Parliament considering that to
the effect every man's affection and disposition in his religion may be clearly
and sufficiently known, Therefore our said Sovereign Lord and estates
foresaids Satutes and ordaines that every Arch bishop and Bishop within the
bounds of his own diocie shall once every year give up to the Thesaurer,
Comptroller, Collector and their deputes, and to the Director of our Sovereign
Lords Chancellarie, a Roll subscriued with his hand containing the names of all
such persons within his diocie who are excommunicate for religion, and
ordaines the said Thesaurer and his deputes that they receive no resignations
nor grant confirmations nor infeftments to nor in favors of any of the
persons whose names shall be contained in the said Roll: And that the Director
of the Chancellarie and his deputes give out no breeues, receive no retoures,
nor direct no precept upon retoures, nor upon comprysings in favors of any of
the said persons whose names shall be insert in the said Roll at no time
thereafter, while the said person or persons produce unto the said Thesaurer,
Comptroller, Director of the Chancellarie and their deputes a sufficient
testimonial subscriued by the said Archibishop or Bishop, testifying their
relaxation from the said excommunication and their obedience and satisfaction
to the Kirk, as the said Thesaurer, Director of the Chancellarie and their
deputes will be answerable to his Majesty upon the dewtie of their office.
And likewise our said Sovereign Lord and Estates foresaids Declares that it
shall be lawful to all Lords of Regalities and to all superiors whatsomever
within this Kingdom, To refuse breeues and precepts of clare-constat in
favors of any person or persons whose names shall be insert in the said Roll:
As also to refuse the entry of Tennents upon comprysing, whose names are
insert in the same Roll.

Act against Jesuits, Seminary Preefts and resetters of them.
OUR Sovereign Lord and Estates of this present Parliament Considring the
impunitie of Jesuits, Seminary Preests and other papists adversaries to the
true Religion professed in this realm, and their resetters in times bygone,
hes been the cause as well of their increase as of their insolence in all the
parts of this realm, And that the same hes proceeded partly upon the
negligent execution of the Acts of Parliament made against the said Papists,
Jesuits and Seminary Priests and their resetters, and partly upon some
obscurity of words in the said acts. Therefore our said sovereign Lord and
Estates foresaids most willing to have the said acts put to dew execution in
all points, and Papistrie and superstition utterly suppressed according to the
intention of the same, Hes ratified, approved and confirmed, and by the tenor
of this present act Ratifies, approues and confirms all and whatsomever acts
of Parliament, either made in his Highness minority and less age, or else
since his acceptance of the government in his own person, against Jesuits,
Seminary Priests, Papists, sayers and hearers of Mass and resetters of the
said persons or any of the^, and decerns and ordaines the same to have full
strength, force and effect, and to be put to dew execution in all time coming
with these explanations after following, That the said acts made against
hearers and sayers of mass shall be put to dew execution, and be extended to all
hearers and sayers of Mass, without any exception or restriction. As likewaies
that all acts made of before against the resetters of the said persons have
their full force, strength and effect, and be put to dew execution against the
said resetters, after lawful intimation and denunciation be made of the said
persons: which denu^ciation and intimation his Highness and the estates
foresaids declares to be sufficient to cause the said resetters of the said
Papists, Jesuits, Seminary Priests and others contained in the said acts,
Incur the pains therein contained, if the same be made at the head burgh of
the shyre where the said persons remains, and at the market cross of
Edinburgh, without any farther intimation to be made thereanent. After the
which denunciation and Intimation to be made, as said is, Our said Sovereign
Lord and Estates foresaids Declares that whosoever thereafter shall wittinglie
and willingly reset any of the said persons, either privatlie or
publictlie, that the said resetters shall incur the pains contained in the
said acts, they being lawfully convict thereof. And that the act made in his
Highness first Parliament, bearing that none that profess not the true religion
presently professed within this realm may be Judge, Procurator or member of
court, Be extended to all and whatsomever offices, without any exception or
restriction in all time coming. And for the better execution of the said acts
Our said Sovereign Lord and Estates foresaids Commands and ordaines all
Archbishops, Bishops and Presbytries to call before them the said papists,
Jesuits, Seminary Priests and their resetters, every one within their own
bounds, And to take trial and cognition if they have contraveened the said
acts or any part thereof, And according as they find after dew trial and
probation That they report the same to his Highness Advocate and secreete
counsel, To the effect they may be called and conveened before them, and
punished according to the said acts in all points.

Act of the Commissariates and jurisdiction given to Archbishops and Bishops.
Our Soverain Lord understanding that in all well governed republics, the
jurisdiction civil and ecclesiastic are several, distinct and diverse
iurisdictio^s, which oght to be administrat by the persons to whom the same
properly belongs: and according to his Highness most loving and princely
affection borne always to the christian reformed Church within this realm,
being most willing that the said Church should brook and ioise their
liberties, privileges, fredome and jurisdiction granted unto them by his
Majesty (from whom only their temporal jurisdiction does flow) and in that
regard belonging to them as being one of the estates of Parliament most
necessare to be maintained for giving of their advise, counsel and assistance
in all his Majesty's great and weighty affairs, Hes with express advise and
consent of the estates of Parliament restored and redintegrate the Arch bishops
and Bishops of this Realm to their former authority, dignity, prorogatiue,
privileges and jurisdictions lawfully pertaining and shall be known to
pertain to them (always flowing from his Majesty, as well as any other
ordinar jurisdiction does) and specially to the jurisdiction of commissariates
and administration of justice by their commissioners and deputies in all
spiritual and ecclesiastical causes contraverted between any persons dwelling
within the bounds and diocees of their prelacies and bishoprics: with full
power to the said Archbishops, Bishops and their successors in all time
hereafter to nominate and creare sufficient, wise discreet and learned men,
best acquainted with the law and practick of this realm, to serve and
administrate justice in the said places of iudicatorie, to constitute clarks
and all other under-officers so often as the same shall valk by dimission,
decease, deprivation or otherways, and to provide others in their places with
as great freedom and liberty as any Archbishops or Bishops in this realm
formerlie hes done: Which commissares to be nominate and create by them shall
judge and decide in all causses belonging to their iudicatorie: and wherein the
commissares presently in office are in use to decide, keeping the same style
and form which is presently observed, and that manner of proceeding which
shall be prescrived and enjoined to them by special iniunctiones without any
alteration of the present laws or introduction of new and uncouth practicks
upon the subjects and lieges, and shall have power of confirmation of
testaments every one of them within their own bounds, the quotes thereof to be
paid to the Arc-hbishops, Bishops, their chamberlaines, factors and
vnder-receivers appointed by them. For the better affectuating whereof his
Majesty and estates of Parliament ordaines letters of horning to be given and
granted by the Lords of Session in that same very sort that the Commissares
present hes it, for execution of al their sentences and decrets which shall
happen to be pronounced by them, and compelling of persons to enter and
confirm the testaments of their defuncts in the very same manner that formerlie
hes been done. And for maintaining all things in better order and the
restraining of unlawful divorcements, too frequentlie practiced within this
realm, to the high dishonor of God and slander of true Religion: His Majesty
with advise and consent foresaid hes statute and ordained that in the burgh of
Ediburgh there shall be resident always four Commissares, two to be nominate
and appointed by the Archbishop of Sanctandrois, and two by the Archbishop of
Glasgow, who shall have the onley power to decide in all causses of divorcement,
As likewise shall have power of reduction of all decreets pronounced by any
other Commissares to the hurt and prejudice of any of the lieges: before whom
it shall be only lawful to intend and persew reductions of inferior
Commissares their sentences and decretes in prima instantia. And incace the
said Commissares to be appointed by the Archbishops of Sanctandrois and
Glasgow, as said is, perform not their duty, the Lords of Session shall have
power to try, cognosce and determine in the same, and shall judge upon all
decreets and sentences alleged to be wrongouslie pronounced by them: And that
because they are his Majesty's great Co^sistory, to whom his highness with advise
of the said estates, Gives and grants an high and supreme commission for all
such causses, to judge and determine of them in such caces: And declares that
it shall be lawful to the said Lords of Counsel and Session To advocate
causses to themselves from any of the Commissares, upon just and lawful
complaints made to them by any of the subjects, and not otherways. Provyding
always that the said Session shall ever be ready to give an account to his
Majesty that their advocations have been grounded upon probable and lawful
grounds for the well of the subjects. And that this foresaid act may be put in
present effect, his Majesty with advise foresaid declares all former erections
of Commissariates to be suppressed and extinct from this forth and for ever,
all constitutions that have been in former time of the same in what soever
part of the realm the same has been erected, and by what soever manner the
same hes proceeded, acts of parliament secreet counsel and others made
thereanent. And in like manner discharges and annulles all presentations, gifts
or dispositions made by his Highness to the Commissares present, or to any other
concerning the said commissariates, and al rights acquired by them by decease,
dimission, or how soever the same hes vaicked, and all gifts and dispositions
made in favors of their Clarks and members of court, by whatsomever manner or
order the same hes proceeded. With this provision always, that the Commissares
presently in office, their clarks and other members of court, who shall be
authorized with testimonial from the Lords of Session of their sufficiency and
qualification to their several places and offices, shall brook and joise the
same, they always receiving a new presentation and gift of their offices from
the Archbishops and Bishops of their dyosies where they serve, between and
the first day of December next to come: Otherways if incace the said
Commissares and other members of court do not produce the foresaid
Testimonial from the Lord of Session, as said is, It shall be lawful to the
Archbishops and Bishops to provide other sufficient persons to the said
places, The restitution of the said jurisdiction always to be with express
reservation of his Highness and his successors their prerogatives and supremacy
in all causses ecclesiastical and civil within this realm. Providing always
that this present act shall no ways be hurtful nor prejudicial to the
heritable right of the commissariate within the bounds of Argyle pertaining to
Archebald now Earl of Argyle, but the same to stand in the same force,
strength and effect as it was before this present act, And notwithstanding
thereof or any clause therein contened Prout de iure.

Act of the Commissioners of the peace.
FOrasmuch as among the infinite monuments and testimonies of his Majesty's
true piety, singular wisdom sinceere zeal to justice and fatherly care of
his people, the estates of this Kingdom have not found any bringing more
deserved commendation and permanent renown to his Majesty, or greater profit,
quyetnes and comfort to his Subjects, nor his constant perseverance in his most
religious and prudent resolution to extirpate the ungodly barbarous and
brutall custom of deadly feeds, which by the inveterate abuse of many bypast
ages was become so frequent in this realm, as the subjects of greatest rank
and quality upon every naughty occasion of base and unworthy contraversies
of neighborhoode, for turves, fold-dykes, furs or marches of lands, foolish
words or drunken discords between their meanest servants and dependers, and
any other in the country, did so readily embrace the protection of their
unjust and unnecessary quarrelles, as did many times involue themselves and
their whole friendship in most bloody and mortal troubles, which they did
prosecute with such malice and cruelty, as to the extreme perrell of their
souls, infame of their memorial, and overthrow of their own and their
adversaries houses, Did distract the kingdom in opposite factions, and many
times furnished matter of most pernicious, seditious and civil wars. The
inconveniences whereof being manifestly seen and sensibly felt both by the
Princes and people of this realm in many bypast ages and earnestly soght to
have been removed, yet the corruption was so universal, that the greatest part
prevailing against the best, that cruel barbaritie had both continuance and
daily increase, until his Majesty bending the excellent wisdom and rare
graces of his royal mind (wherewith God hes endewed him more abundantly
then any King that ever did reign in this Island) against that godless,
unnatural and beastlie-custome, did devise and establish a most godly, just
and prudent law and ordinance for the course to be observed, for removing upon
equitable and just conditions the deadly feeds, which then stood in great
number between the most powerful subjects in this kingdom and their kinsmen,
assisters and partakers: In the execution whereof, God having miraculouslie
assisted his Majesty's most holy and just intention, after exceeding great care
and pains taine by his Majesty in trial of the original causes of the said
discords, the true circumstances of the injuries and loses sustained by either
party, and in prescriving dew satisfaction to be indifferently made for
redress of al bypast harms and wrongs, his Majesty's admirable constancy hes
so overcome all difficulties, that the whole known feeds within the kingdom
being now removed by perfect reconciliation, and just contentment of all
parties having interest therein, his Majesty's whole subjects finds such joy
and happiness in the sweet fruits of his wisdom and providence expressed in
that case, That they earnestly wish that his Majesty who hes so carefully
exterminate that abominable pest of deadly feeds, may in his singular
wisdom find means for ever to prevent the reviuing of that monster. Wherein
his Majesty confidering that nothing gave so great grouth and strength to that
bypast barbaritie as the sloth of magistrates in not suppressing the first
seeds of these dissentions, which being small and weak in the beginning, for
Peets, turves, devits, fold-dykes, poyndings, neighborlie marches, injurious
words or light brawles, were then easily to be settled, if diligence and
authority had been joined for repressing thereof, which being neglected by
these to whom it appertained, these light jarres and insolences did very often
kindle such flames of disorder, dissension, rank or and feed, as in many years
with great streams of blood, desolation and ruin of great and ancient houses
and races could hardly be quenched. For remeed whereof his Majesty and
estates foresaids Ratifies and approoues the former act made by his Highness for
abolishing deadly feeds in every head, clause and artickle thereof. And
farther statutes and ordaines that in every shyre within this kingdom there
shall be yearly appointed by his Majesty, some godly, wife and virtuous
gentlemen of good quality, moyen and report, making residence within the same,
in such number as the bounds of the shyre shall require, to be Commissioners
for keeping his Majesty's peace, to who^ his Majesty with advise of the Lords
of his privy Counsel shall give power and commission to overse, try and prevent
all such occasiones as may breed trouble and violence amongst his Majesty's
subjects, or forceable contempt of his Majesty's authority and breach of his
peace: and to command all persons in whom they shall see manifest intention to
make trouble or disorder, either by gathering together of idle and disorderly
persons, or by publict bearing or wearing of Pistolets or other forbidden
weapons, and such other riotous and swaggring behavior: to bind themselves
and find caution under competent pains to observe his Majesty's peace, and
for their compearance before his Majesty's Justice or Lords of his privy
Counsel, to underly such order as shall be found convenient for punishing
their transgressions or staying of troubles and enormities: And if needs bees,
to require the dewtifull and obedient subjects of the shyre to concur with
them in preventing all such contemps and violences, or for taking or warding of
the wilful and disobedient authors committers and fosterers of these crimes
and disorders under such competent arbitrare pains as his Majesty and Lords
of his privy Counsel shall appoint for the offenders, and such of the country
as being required shall not give their ready and afolde concurrance to his
Majesty's commissioners in the premises, whereby the ordinare magistrates and
officers within the shyres may be the better assisted, and their absence,
employments or other impediments more commodiouslie supplied, without
derogation of their jurisdiction or want of ready comfort and justice to the
obedient subjects within the bounds thereof. Ordaining also the said
commissioners to give true advertisement and information to the Lords of his
Majesty's privy Counsel, Justice general and his deputes, his Majesty's
Thesaurer and other magistrates and officers whom it effeires, of the names of
such faithful and vnsuspect witnesses and assyssers to be sommoned in all
crimes and disorders which shall happen to fall forth within the said shyres,
as shall be known to be most meet and able for trial and probation of the
same, and for eschewing that such as are either aged, sickly or unable to
travel, or ignorant of the facts to be tried, be not unjustly vexed or
vnnecessarly drawn from their own houses and effaires for matters wherein
they are not able to give any light.

Act of the apparelles of Judges, Magistrates and Churchmen.
OUR Sovereign Lord and Estates of this present Parliament finding by daily
experiences that the greatness of his Majesty's empire, magnificence of his
Court, fame of his wisdom and justice and of the civilitie of his subjects,
hes already begun to allure diverse foraine Princes and other strangers of all
estates to make more frequent repair to this country nor ever they did in any
preceding age: which resort of strangers will by all appearance both continue
and daily more and more increase, and by them, no doubt report will go through
all the world of the estate and government of the kingdom according to the
order which they shall see observed within the same: whereof the rules and good
exemple flowing from the estates of Parliament and magistrates to the whole
remanent subjects of the realm, It is most necessare that such gravitie and
comelines be used by the Lords and Commissares of Parliament, and other
magistrates in their apparel and behaueor as may best deserve the good report
and true commendation of all Princes, Noble men and other strangers who shall
have occasion to see and relate the same. The respect whereof having induced
his Majesty to prescriue to the Nobility apparel for the Parliament beco^ming
their honorable estate: And understanding that the remanent members of that
high Court hes not co^formed themselves to like conveniencie, neither yet that
the course intended by his Majesty for discharging noble men and gentle men to
be elected Provosts and magistrates of burrowes (whereof none should be capable
but burgesses, actual trafickers and inhabitants of the said burrowes) hes
taine such effect as is most necessare for preservation of the liberties and
good estate of the said burrowes, and hindering the dissipation of their common
good and perverting of their privileges. For remeede whereof his Majesty with
advise of the estates of his Hignes Parliament Statutes and ordaines that no
man shall in any time coming be capable of Provostrie or other magistracy
within any burgh of this realm, nor to be elected to any of the said offices
within a burgh but marcha^ts and actual trafickers inhabiting within the said
burghes allanerlie, and no others. And that the said magistrates of burrowes
to be hereafter elected, and their commissioners of Parliament Shall have and
wear at Parliament conventions and other solemn times and meettings when the
dignity shall require it, such comely and decent apparel as his Majesty
shall prescriue convenient for their rank and estate, whereby they may be
decemed from other common Burgesses, and be more reverenced by the people
subject to their charge. And because a comely, decent and orderly habit and
apparel in the Judges of the land, is not only an ornament to themselves
(being a badge and mark for distinguishing them from the vulgar sort) but the
same also breeds in common people that reverence and regard that is dew and
proper for men in these places: And this being a custom universally observed
almost through all Europe, The want whereof is much censured by strangers
resorting in these parts. The said estates therefore upon infinite proofs
they have of his Majesty's most singular wisdom in all his directiones and of
his gracious love and affection to this his native kingdom. Have in all
humility referred to his Highness own appointment The assigning of any such
several sort of habit and vestiment as shall be in his Majesty's judgment
most fitting and proper, as well for Lords of Session being the suprem^ Judges
in civil actions, as for all other inferior Judges of the like causes, as also
for the criminal and Ecclesiastical Judges, and for Advocates, Lawyers and
all others living by law and practice thereof, that so every one of these
people may be known and dignosced in their place, calling and function, and
may be accordingly regarded and respected. Attover his Majesty and estares
foresaids, considering what slander and contempt hes arisen to the
Ecclesiastical estate of this kingdom by the occasion of the light and
indecent apparel used by some of that profession, and chiefly these having
vote in Parliament. It is therefore statute that every Preacher of Gods word
shall hereafter wear black, grave and comely apparel beseeming men of their
estate and profession. As likewaies that all Pryors, Abbots and Prelates having
vote in Parliament, and specially Bishops, shall wear grave and decent
apparel agreeable to their function, and as appertains to me^ of their rank,
dignity and place. And because the whole estates humbly and tha^kfully
acknowledges that God of his great mercy hes made the people and subjects of
this country so happy as to have a King reign over us who is most godly, wise
and religious, haring al erroneous and vain superstition, just in government
and of long experience therein, knowing better then any King living what
appertains and is convenient for every estate in their behavior and dewtie.
Therefore it is agreed and consented to by the said estates that what order so
ever his Majesty in his great wisdom shall think fit to prescriue for the
apparel of Churchmen agreeable to their estate and moyen, The same being sent
in write by his Majesty to his Clarke of Register, shall be a sufficient
warrant to him for inferting thereof in the books of Parliament, to have the
strength and effect of an act thereof, with executorials of horning to be
direct thereupon against such persons as within the space of forty days after
the publication or intimation to them of the said act or charges used against
them thereupon, shall not provide themselves of the apparel to be appointed by
his Majesty for men of their vocation and estate to be used and worn by them
and their successors at the times and in manner to be expressed in the said Act
to be made by his Highness thereanent.

Act of skandalous speeches and libels.
Our Soverain Lord foreseing that there is nothing so necessare for the
perpetual well and quietness of al his subjects of this monarchy as the
furtherance and acco^plishment of the vnio^ of his two famous and most ancient
kingdoms of Scotland and England, whereof his Majesty out of his fatherly
care of the peace and happiness of his good and faithful people, having most
instantly and earnestly solicited the perfection, and by the assistance of the
worthiest members of both kingdoms so effectually advanced the same, as he
hopes, God willing, in his reign to see the wished end of that great work,
which in his royal person hes received so miraculous and happy a beginning: And
nevertheles finding therein such malicious lettes as the devil and his
supposts do usually suggest to the hinderance of al just and godly
interprises, Specially by the false and calumnious brutes, speeches and writes
craftily uttered and dispersed by some lawles and souleles people of this
realm, as well in private conferences as in their meettinges at tavernes,
ailehouses and plays, and by their pasquils, libels, rymes, cockalins,
comedies and such like occasions whereby they sla^der malign and revile the
people, estate and country of England, and diverse his Majesty's honorable
Counselors, magistrates and worthy subjects of that his Majesty's kingdom:
the continuance whereof being able to incense the people of England to just
grief and miscontentment, may not only hinder the intended union of all the
good subjects of this monarchy, but stir up in them such irreconciliable evil
will, as with time might bring forth most dangerous and harmeful effects. For
remeede and preventing whereof, his Majesty remembering how strait and severe
punishment hes by the laws and acts of his most royal progenitors kings of
this realm heretofore been ordained to be inflicted upon such as should devise
or utter false and slanderous speeches and writes to make dissentions between
the Prince and his subjects, or raise sedition in the realm, and considering
that al such purposes and writes as may breed disliking between the
inhabitants of the said kingdoms of Scotland and England, being now al
become his Majesty's liege-people, equally subject and equally beloved of his
Highness, Tends to most dangerous dissension and sedition amongs his subjects:
Therefore his Majesty with advise and consent of the whole estates of this
Parliament, statutes and ordaines, That who so ever shall hereafter by word or
write devise, utter or publish any false, slanderous or reproachful speeches or
writes of the estate, people or country of England, or of any Counselor
thereof, tending to the remembrance of the ancient grudges borne in time of
bypast troubles, (the occasion whereof is now happily abolished by the blessed
conjunctio^ of the said kingdoms under his Majesty's soveraignity and
obedience) or to the hinderance of the wished accomplishment of the perfect
union of the said kingdoms, or to the slander or reproach of the estate,
people or country of England, or dishonor or prejudice of any Cou^sellor of
the said king dome, whereby hatred may be fostered and entertained or misliking
raised between his Majesty's faithful subjects of this I Will. The authors of
such seditious, slanderous and injurious speeches or writes or dispersers
thereof, after trial taine of their offense, either before his Majesty's
justice or the Lords of his Highness privy Counsel, shall be severelie
punished in their persons and goods, by inprisonment, banishment, fyning or
more rigorous corporal pain, as the quality of the offense shall be found to
merit at his Majesty's pleasure: And all such as hearing or getting knowledge
of any such speeches or writes, shall conceal the same, and not reveile them
to his Majesty's ordinare officers, magistrates or Counselors, whereby the
authors and dispersers thereof may be punished, shall underly the like trial
and pain.

Act anent fugitive persons of the borders to the in-countrie.
FOrasmuch as the Kings Majesty is resolved to purge the middleshires of this
I Will heretofore called the borders of Scotland and England of that barbarous
cruelty, wickedness and incivilitie which by inveterate custom was almost become
natural to many of the inhabitants thereof, and to reduce them to the
knowledge, love and fear of God, reverence of his Majesty's authority,
obedience of his laws and duty to their nighbors: For acco^plishing of that
most royal design, made chose of one to be Commissioner in these bounds, whom
by many assured proofs in former employments of greatest consequence, his
Majesty knew to be endued with all qualities necessary for so weighty a
charge: who following preciselie the rules of his Majesty's most prudent
directions, and using all possible diligence and dexterity in prosecution
thereof, made so happy progress in that good course, as justly punishing the
most perversed and rebellious ringleaders (whose amendment was desperate) and
transporting others of them forth of this I Will, the rest were brought to very
settled quyetnes and obedience of his Majesty's laws, a very few number of
our-lawes only excepted, who being so earnestly searched and persued in these
bounds, as al hope of escaping and longer impunity was taine from them, they
have by most subtle and crafty means of changing their names and dissembling
the place of their nativity, Convoyed themselves in the in-countries of this
realm, and insinuated themselves in service with Noble men and others of good
quality, not only thereby eschewing their deserved punishment, but also
abusing and harming his Majesty's good subjects by their darned stouths in the
incountrie transported, reset and quyetly sold in the bounds of the late
borders: And again stealing gear forth thereof and out of the bounds of these
middle-shires, and outting and selling the same in the in-countries. Besides
that others of the saides outlawes have been allured and had reset and
oversight in the in-countries by some men of rank and power to be instruments
and executors of such revenge and mischief against these to whom they bear
malice, grudge or quarrel, which for fear of his Majesty's laws and
authority they durst not attempt by themselves. For remeede whereof his Majesty
with advise and consent of the estates of Parliament, Statutes and ordaines
that no man shall hereafter either receive or retain any man borne or long
habituate in the late borders in his service or company or upon his lands,
unless he have certain knowledge or a true and authentic testimonial of his
Majesty's great Commissioner of the late borders or his deputes, of the said
border-mans true name and surname, place of his nativitie and report of his
truth and lawtie, and that he is no known malefactor, but repute a dewtifull
and obedient subject, under the pain to incur the danger, and to be made
answerable civilly and criminally to his Majesty and all his lawful subjects
for all actions and crimes which might be any ways laid to the charge of the
said broken men, for any cause or occasion either proceeding or during the
time of their receiving or retaining them in their service, company or upon
their lands, as if the resetter had committed the said faults himself. As
likewise because some who are not known to have committed any heinous offense
in their own person obtaining testimonial of their name, birth and good
report may give the same to broken men to be used by them in places where they
are not known, It is statute and ordained that whosoever shall either give his
testimonial to any man, whereby it may be abused by another nor him to whom
it was trewlie granted, or who shall falsely vie another man's testimonial, or
who shall fordge to himself or use a false testimonial in the premises, shall
be punished to the death. And to the effect his Majesty's faithful and obedient
subjects may have the better knowledge of the said fugitives and broken men,
and that such as reset them may want all pretext and excuse of ignorance, It
is statute and ordained that a Roll shall be made by his Majesty's great
Commissioner of the middle shires, containing the names of the said rebels,
fugitives, outlawes and broken men with the most notor and evident marks and
description of their age, stature, color and other tokens whereby they may be
most easily and readily known. And being imprinted shall be sent to the
shireffes and magistrates of the in-countries, and proclaimed at the market
crosses of the head burrowes of the shyres and other places needful, And
thereafter be publictlie affixed upon the said crosses or tolbuithes of the
said burrowes. After which publication it is statute that the contraveners of
this Act or any head or artickle of the same shall be rigorously punished in
their persons and goods in manner foresaid. Extractum de Libro Actorum
