The Dispairing Youths Grief Crowned with Joy and Happiness, By the Return of
his Dear LOVE.
Forsaken Lovers thus Complain,
nay, and for Death will call;
But when their Loves return again,
amends is made for all.
To the Tune of, Black and Sullen hour.
This may be Printed, R.P.





ADieu my Dear whom I adore,
thou art the cause of all my grief,
I never shall behold thee more,
here am I left without Relief:
It was in thee I placed my chiefest Bliss,
But now thy Company I miss;
But now thy Company I miss;
Alas! what Grief and Torment's this!
Alas! what Grief and Torment's this!
I must exclaim against you now,
whose heart will not wi^h pity move,
Could you so soon forget your Uow,
and violate the Laws of Love!
No Creature e're adored you more than I,
Yet, yet I here in sorrow lie:
Yet, yet I here, etc.
And all through your Inconstancy,
And all through your Inconstancy.
When I am in my Nights Repose,
methinks I have her in my Arms,
Where I most tenderly enclose
thee with a thousand pleasing Charms:
But when I wake and find it nothing so,
My heart is filled with Grief and woe;
My heart, etc
Alas! I know not where to go;
Alas I know not where to go.
F^^^ would I cast thee from my mind,
but yet alas! it is all in vain;
No joy or Comfort can I find,
while you requite me with disdain:
And leave me here a Lover quite forlorn,
Well may I wish I Would never been born;
Well may, etc.
Then live the object of your scorn;
then live the Object of your scorn.
Since I am thus in sorrow slain,
by the departure of my dear,
You gentle Winds that Fans the Plains,
convey these tidings to my Dear:
And let her understand my grief and woe.
Who knows but she may pity show;
Who knows etc.
Why should she seek my overthrow?
Why should she seek my overthrow?
He had no sooner spoke this word,
but then her heart began to yern,
No longer Grief she could afford,
said she, I perfectly discern
Thy Love is Loyal, therefore till I dye,
Take hand and heart, my dear, for why;
Take hand and heart, etc.
I cannot leave thee, no not I;
I cannot leave thee, no not.
Then turned he his head aside,
most cheerfully he then did seem,
Is this my Jewel? he replied,
or is it some deluding Dream?
No, no, it is I, then leave lamenting e're,
For all thy blessings i will restore;
For all thy, etc.
We never will be divided more;
We never will be divided more.
Though I withdrew my self some time,
it was to prove thy Constancy,
But dearest pardon me this Crime,
who from my promise cannot fly:
My heart in purity I still did save,
Which none alive but thee shall have;
Which none alive but thee shall have:
I come to heal the wound I gave;
I come to heal the Wound I gave.
FINIS.
