Coridon and Parthenia, The Languishing Shepherd made Happy.
Or, Faithful Love rewarded.
Being a most Pleasant and Delectable New Play Song:
Here mournful Love is turned into Delight,
To this we a Chaste amorist Invite;
Where Charming beauty rules its powr's like Death,
To Save or Murder with the self-same breath:
The Noble Swain, whose Youthful Love has won
So many Mymphs, by Love was here undone:
Languishing faint, on the Gold Ground he lies,
Until the Sunshine of Parthenia's Eyes
Dissolved the Cloud that did benight his bliss,
And turned his Torments into Paradise.
To the Tune of, When busy Fame.




When busy Fame over all the Plain,
Parthenia's Praises rung,
And on the Oaten Pipe each Swain;
her matchless Beauties Sung:
The envious Nymphs were forced to yield,
she had the sweetest face,
No Emulor'd Disputes were held,
but for the Second place,
Young Coridon whose stubborn heart,
no Beauties e're could move,
But smiled at Cupids Bow and Dart,
and brave the God of Love:
He Would view this Nymph, and pleased at first,
such silent Charms to see,
With wonder gazed, then sighed and Cursed,
his Curiosity.
CRying alas, I am undone,
so Powerful are her eyes,
Those killing Charms prevailed above,
and all my thoughts surprise:
In coolest shades fierce feavors burn,
martyred by Love I fry,
And now except Parthenia Turn,
and smile on me I dye.
My Hood be here for ever laid,
and on this Ferdant Plain.
Beneath this spreading Myrtle Shade,
till death I must remain:
My Snowy Flocks may freely stray,
whilst here I gazing lie,
And dare not move from hence away,
for if I do I dye.
Parthenia cruel Nymph no more,
turn hence that Angel face,
Which Coridon must still adore,
as chief of Mortal Race:
Oh! from the Groves sad Eccho's sound,
and say in vain I try,
Nay, still augment the Fatal wound,
I must Loves Martyr dye.
What doleful tunes amongst pleasant Reeds
my Bleeting Flocks complain,
Whilst wolves invade them as they feed,
all scater'd through the Plain:
Here Chained by Love by cruel Love,
on earth I mourning lie,
And though my Couch sweet Violets prove,
yet Languishing I dye.
Whilst in sad strains the Winged Quire,
my doleful Requies Sing
And Chaunt how I for Love expire,
unto the blooming Spring:
Let purling streams likewise declare,
as they run murmering by,
How for Parthenia I despair,
and thus dispairing dye.

Parthenia. Ah hark, what sad Laments are these,
what mournful sounds are here:
What dying Sounds my fancy sees,
what sighs invade my Ear?
It Is this Myrtle Grove i will seek,
it is sure some Lover nigh,
I Will find, and to him Comfort speak,
before for Love he dye.
Oh it is Coridon kind Swain,
from whence proceeds your grief?

Coridon. By you I wounded here remain,
it is you can yield relief:
Conquered by your prevailing Charms,
and by your starry eyes,
For you unless you raise my Arms,
a faithful Shepherd dies.

Parthenia. Alas poor Swain, for me I swear,
by Cupid all above,
You shall not languish nor despair,
but first enjoy my Love:

Coridon. Parthenia kind it is sure I dream,
O Angel form draw nigh,
Speak speak again that saving Theme,
that will not let me dye,

Parthenia. Rise Shepherd, rise, and freely take,
since thou do constant prove,
Those chaste delights, which for thy sake
I have designed in Love:

Coridon. Oh i am so Ravished with this voice
that dangers I defy,
And in Parthenia's Love rejoice,
which will not let me dye.

Parthenia Come, come my, Coridon, let us haste,
unto yon pleasing Bower;
For Lovers should no moments waste,
whilst joys in plenty shower:
But folded in each others Arms,
loves utmost Forces try;
whilst warbling noats augments our charms
and we in pleasure dye.
