An excellent new Ballad of the Birth and Passion, of our Savior Christ.
To the tune of, Dulcina.




IVry ^^^e to Jebu-salem,
(all the World was taxed then)
Blessed Mary brought to Bethelem,
more than all the World again:
A gift so blessed
So good, the best
that ere was seen, was heard or done;
A King, a Christ,
Prophet and Priest,
a Jesus, God, a Man, a Son.
Happy night, a day was never,
half so happy, sweet and fair:
Singing soldiers, blessed ever,
fill the sky with sweetest air.
Amazed men fear,
They see they hear,
yet doubt, and ask how this was tone:
'Twas bid, be bold,
It was foretold,
this night has God himself a Son.
There appears a golden Usher,
Kings attending on her train:
The bright Sun could not out-blush her,
such a Star never shone again.
See now, it stays,
Seeming it says
go in and see, what there is done:
A Child, whose birth
Leagues heaven and earth,
Jesus to us, to God a Son.
Subtle Herod sought to find him,
with a purpose black as heil:
But a greater power confined him,
and his purpose did repel.
Who should betray,
Do all obey,
as fitting was it should be done,
They all adore,
And kneel before
this God and Man, to God a Son.
'Twas upon a Comments blazing,
Cuma to Augustus said,
This for-shews an act ameazing,
for a Mother, still a Maid,
A Babe shall hear,
That all must fear,
and suddenly it must be done,
Nay, Caesar thou
To him must bow,
he is God a Man, to God a Son.
Is not this a blessed wonder,
God is Man, and Man is God?
Foolish Jews mistook the thunder,
should proclaim this King abroad.
Angels they sing,
Behold the King,
in Bethelem where this was done:
Then we as they,
Rejoice and say,
we have a Savior, God a Son.

See him by the soldiers taken,
when with Ave, and a kiss,
He that Heaven had quite forsaken,
had betrayed him, and with this,
Behold him (bound
And guarded round)
to Caiaphas borne to lose his breath:
There see the Jews.
Heavens King abuse,
O think upon his precious death.
See him in the hands of Pilate,
like a base offender stripped,
