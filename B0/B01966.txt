Celia's Complaint, for the loss of her Virginity.
She by fair words was quickly won,
Amyntas proved Unkind;
And Celia says, she is quite Undone,
Much troubled in her mind.

DEath quickly come away,
and ease me of my pain,
The longer here I stay,
my Life I must disdain:
Such deadly smart does pierce my heart,
no mortal can endure,
Then let me dye,
For certainly,
I never shall find a Cure.
Amyntas he is gone;
I am forsaken quite,
He was the only Man,
in whom I took delight:
My Life to me, is Misery,
since he is so unkind,
He Is from me fled,
And I half Dead,
poor soul, am left behind.
I Languish now in Grief
by Night, and eke by Day,
I can find no Relief,
but hourly waste away:
Was ever Lass, at this strange pass,
or Wounded like to me;
Come quickly Death,
To stop my Breath,
and end my Misery.
I, wish I never had seen
those eyes that me betrayed,
Then surely had I been,
a matehiess happy Maid:
Deluding Tongue, thou did me wrong,
as well as his fair eyes;
And Conquered all,
I had a fall,
and never again shall rise.

MY spotless Virgins Fort,
thou strongly did assault,
My Favor thou did Court,
and this was my great fault:
So soon to yield, to thee the Field,
which did my Honor stain;
And now I cry,
Continually,
poor Celia Loved in vain.
You Damsels all beware,
take warning now by me,
And let not Speeches fair,
betray your Honesty:
For I, poor I, assuredly,
by them too soon was won:
In discontent,
I now Lament,
alas, I Am quite undone.
Ten thousand Sighs and Sobs,
part with every day,
I feel such pangs and Throbs,
and so Consume away:
That with desire, I burn like fire,
to be within thy Grave:
Which to obtain,
Would be my gain,
that is all I now would have.
False Young Men now give over,
and cease for to betray,
Deceive poor Maids no more,
who hardly can say nay:
But quickly how, and make a vow,
to Love you evermore:
Then them you leave,
To mourn and grieve,
which grieves their hearts full sore.
But it is a dreadful thing,
that you should use them so,
Which to their hearts will bring
such Sorrow, Grief, and Woe:
That often times, maids in their primes,
they do themselves destroy:
Because they find,
Their Loves unkind,
and cannot them enjoy.
Then dally so no more,
with Maidens that are kind,
For Blessings in great store,
the Honest man shall find:
But he that does fly from the Truth,
of what he did protest:
Shall met with be,
Assuredly
believe me it is no Jest.
