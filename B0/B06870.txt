King CHARLES his Glory, And REBELS Shame. Colonel Hevvson.

To a pleasant New Tune: Or, The Crossed Couple.
CHARLES the first was a Noble King,
Fa la la la la la.
His Fame through all the world did ring,
Fa la etc.
But in this he was to blame
That after all his pomp and Fame,
To lose himself at a Scottish Game.
fa la, etc.
It Was but a foolish thing.
He was a Prince of courage stout,
fa la, etc.
Although his Glass was soon run out,
fa la, etc.
Behind him he left a Noble Stock,
May give Traitors a handsome knock,
For making a King submit to a block
fa la, etc.
Good things may wind about,
then Husons Eye goes ou^
The blood that he lost as I suppose,
fa la, etc.
Caused fire to rise in Olivers Nose,
fa la, etc.
This Ruling Nose did bear such a sway,
It cast such a heat and shining ray,
That England scarce knew night from day
fa la, etc.
Good Lord preserve his house.
This Oliver was of Huntington,
fa la, etc.
Born he was but a Brewers Son,
fa la, etc.
He soon forsook the Dray and Sling,
And counted a Brew House a petty thing,
Unto the Stately Throne of a King.
fa la, etc.
It far surpast a Tun.
But Oliver had a heart of Gall,
fa la, etc.
To murder his Prince at White Hall,
fa la, etc.
He swares whosoever is over the Main,
Whether a French King or of Spain,
Yet in England no King shall Reign.
fa la, etc.
Lest Nol himself should fall.
Duke Humphrey was the first Protector,
fa la, etc.
Henry the second the next Projector,
fa la, etc.
Then thirdly Oliver he took place,
But Lucifer soon removed his Grace,
And set up young Dick the fool of his race.
fa la, etc.
Dick loved a Cup of Nector
No sooner was Dickee got up to the throne,
fa la, etc.
But he considered 'twas none of his own,
fa la, etc.
And staring this way, and that way about,
Desirous to be resolved of a doubt,
In comes Lambert and turns him out.
fa la; etc.
So Lamberts courage was shown.
Fleetwood desirous of the place,
fa la, etc.
Sends forth Lambert the Scots to face,
fa la, etc.
But in the strength of his desire,
When he did intend poor Jocky to fire,
His men forsook him and left him ^th mire.
fa la, etc.
Ay and that was his disgrace.
Thus you perceive how some do rise,
fa la, etc.
And even surmount the Aerie Skies.
fa la, etc.
But when they are up they shall have a fall,
Witness Fleetwood, blind Hewson, and all
The Ragged Rout of a Cobblers Stall.
fa la, etc.
Would Hewson had both his eyes.
When Dame Fortune casts a frown,
fa la, etc.
These upstart Gallants fall headlong down,
fa la, etc.
I could wish they would view their own state,
And Repent before it is to late,
For fear lest a Gibbet will be their last fate,
fa la, etc.
Or whipping about the Town.
Clear Whitehall of Lobster and Goose,
fa la, etc.
Cast RUMPS and Kidneys out of the house,
fa la, etc.
Fetch in Charles from over the Main,
Make Wars with Dutch men, peace with Spain,
Then we shall have money and Trading again.
fa la, etc.
And then we care not a Lowse.
Citizens look to your hits, I say,
fa la, etc.
Let no Cobbler preach nor pray,
fa la, etc.
Tom Cobblers gone the Lord knows whether,
Lambert and he I hope are together,
Now fetch in the King we shall have fair weather.
fa la, etc.
Whip Cobblers run away.
Blind Huson was not over kind,
fa la, etc.
To run and leave his men behind,
fa la, etc.
I wish we could find him by the scent,
There Is neither Law nor RUMP Parliament
Should save him from death to give us content.
Good People pity the Blind.
