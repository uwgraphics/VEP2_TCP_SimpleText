A pleasant posie, or sweet Nosegay of fragrant smellyng Flowers: gathered in
the Garden of heavenly pleasure, the holy and blessed Bible.
To the Tune of the black Almayne.
A Stock of flowers, bedewed with showers,
In a Garden now there springs:
With mirth and glee, upon a Tree,
A Byrd there sits and sings,
So pleasant is her voice,
It does my heart rejoice:
She sets her tunes and noates so meet,
That unto me it seems so sweet:
That all the Flowers that ever could be,
Was never so sweet as this to me,
The like before I did never se.
The Bible it is, that Garden iwys,
Which God preserve always:
Likewise Gods word it is that Bird,
That now so much I praise.
Also those goodly Flowers,
So well bedewed with showers:
I will now go about to gather,
And put them in a Posy together:
I will not put them in no Chest,
But bynd them up as I think best,
And keep them always next my breast.
The first I find, to please my mind,
A bell he had to name:
Enoch always, is worthy of praise,
Like wise of worthy Fame.
Look you what Moses wrytes,
And in Genesis there resites:
How God took him the story says,
That he should never taste of death:
And also Noe that righteous man
A curious work did take in hand,
To make the Arc we understand.
Good Abraham, that faithful man,
In God did trust always:
He did not fear, nor once despair.
His only son to slay.
Isacke was no weed,
Nor Jacob in very deed:
Joseph was a Flower of price,
God did him save from cruel device
Also Moses eke we find,
And Aaron like wise up we bynd,
Joshua is not out of mind.
The Judges also, both less and mo,
They were of worthy Fame:
To speak of all, my time is small,
To rehearce them all by name.
The Prophet Samuel,
Our God did love him well:
David was a Flower so sweet,
To make him king God thought it meet
For great Golias he has slain.
And Sallomon after him did raygne
Which unto wisdom did attain.
When Achab did florysh, the Ravens did norish
Elia a man of God,
King Josias, and Esdras
We find and pacient Job.
They feared our God of might,
And served him day and night:
No joy nor pain could them procure,
But always by him to endure:
Esaias like wise and Jeremy,
They preached always earnestly
and did their duty faithfully,
And Daniell destroyed Bell,
The Babilonians God:
The Dragon also, he brought to woe,
Without either sword or Rod.
To rehearce the prophets all,
By their names them for to call:
Although they be of worthy Fame,
It is to long them for to name:
We may not Toby as leave behynd,
Yet was he almost out of mind,
But few such flowers now can we find.
Full well we know, no flowers can blow,
But boisterous storms must find:
For that is no Flower, that every shower,
Does drive away with wynd*
For all these goodly Flowers,
Had many stormy showers:
Before that they could blow or bud,
Or bring forth seed to do any good:
They did abide both cold and blast,
Yet always did they stand steadfast,
Till all the storms were gone and past.
Now at this time, for our gracious queen,
Let us give hearty prays:
God may her defend, from enemies hand:
at this time and always.
And send her prosperous raygne,
With us for to remain,
For to defend Gods word so pure,
And ever with it for to endure:
That she may be to us a bower,
To keep us always when it does shower,
I pray God save that Princly flower.
FINIS.
John Simon.
