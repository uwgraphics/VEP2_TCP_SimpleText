The Great Turks terrible Challenge, this year 1640. Pronounced against the
Emperor of Germany and the King of Poland by Soloma Hometh who lately
deceased, but continued by his brother Ibraim, the first of that name.
To the tune of My bleeding heart, or Lets to the wars again.




YOu that desire strange news to hear,
Unto my story now give ears,
Great wars there is pronouncd of late,
By him who does all Christians hate:
Against Romes Imperial Majesty,
And King of Poland joining nigh,
By the great Turk who would devour,
Each Christian kingdom by his power.
Soloma Hometh called so,
This Tirant great and Christians foe,
At three and thirty years of age,
Death finished up his days and rage:
Yet for all that their Turkish hate,
Against Christian kings does naught abate,
But God deliver Christians all,
That they by such do never fall.
Though death did happily prevent,
The cruel Tirants bad intent,
Yet he which does him now succeed,
More terrors to the world does breed:
those bloody purpose is inclinde,
To prosecute as it was designd,
The Christian kingdoms to devour,
But God confound the Pegans power.
With fearful sentence challenging,
Romes Emperor, and Polands king,
Their Princes, Peers, and Pope also,
With all that there adjoynes unto:
For by their kingdoms crowns they swear*
To come before their Cities there,
But God deliver Christians all,
That they by such do never fall.
And will with thirteen kingdoms rise
The Christian world for to surprise,
Full thirten hundred thousand strong
Of Turkish powers to march along,
With full intention to subdue,
The Christian princes with this crew,
But God deliver Christians all,
That they by such do never fall.
Nay more say they, behold at length
With all our great Imperial strength,
Such as by you was never seen,
Nor yet in any kingdom been:
Weell come your nations to destroy,
Which you shall never more enjoy,
But God, etc.
With mighty power for to subdue,
The Germane Emperor, and pursue
Him to the end with fire and sword,
And tyranny to be abhord:
Also the Polanders devour,
With force of arms and Pagans power,
But God deliver Christians all,
That they by such do never fall.
The second Part
to the same Tune.


THey give them for to understand,
How they will terrify each land,
To rob to murder and destroy
With burning all they do enjoy,
And put them to the cruellest death,
That ever was devizd on earth:
But God deliver Christians all,
That they by such do never fall.
Their bloody minds they thus reveal,
The golden scepter and the seal,
Of Rome say they we will suppress,
And fill your nations with distress,
And those say they we prisners take
More worse then dogs of them we will make
But God etc.
The Turk against the Polands King
Five hundred thousand strong does bring
And of Tartarians by him sent
To Wallachy Seventy thousand went
Which puts the country in great fear
To see their enemies so near:
But Lord etc.
The king of Poland for this end
Lord Palatine to Rome did send
Ambassadors to certify
There enemies aproached nigh,
In the mean time the Polander
Great preparation makes for war,
But Lord, etc.
The Turks of Tunnis and Argier
To aggravate the peoples fear
With sixty sail of galleys goes
The Christian kingdoms to oppose,
Such preparation there is still,
As may the world with rumors fill.
But God, etc.
A greater navy there is more
Providing near the Turkish shore,
Of ships and Galleys sixscore sail,
Least they should of their purpose fail.
The Knights of Malta they likewise,
For to prevent their enemies,
The landing of the Turk to stop,
Have strongly blockt their Harbors up.
Within five leagues the enemies,
From the Polon^^h frontiers lies,
Where unawares they chancst to fall,
On the Polonians General.
Who with four hundred men and horse,
Went to discry the Turkish force,
But most part of his men are slain,
And he with hurt returned again.
So that in Poland there is bred,
By them great terror and much dread,
For to behold their enemy,
So strong against their frontiers ly,
For which they have prolaim'd a fast,
That God in mercy at the last,
May rid them of these Pagans all,
That they by them may never fall.
