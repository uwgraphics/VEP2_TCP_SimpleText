PANEGYRIC Upon the Death of Lieut: Thomas Hadom.
Who Deceased 4th of April 1700, in the 27th Year of his Age, having been Ten
Years an Officer in King WILLIAM's Service.
NO Youth nor Strength, nor Vigor of that kind,
Greatness of Soul, nor yet Heroic mind,
Undaunted Courage* Magnanimity,
Nor Gifts, nor Parts, of the most high Degree,
Nor racked Skill, nor highest reach of Arts,
Tho all conjoined, and all did act their parts;
No Medicines, tho proper and in season,
Applied by Art, and highest pitch of Reason:
Nor is there ought, in all the Earth that can
Preserve the Life of fadeing Mortal Man:
But in due time, by
Both Young and Aged, yea all Mankind must die.
Here was a Youth for Generosity,
For Courage, Candor, Ingenuity,
And other parts, of Person, and of Mind,
That of his Years, few Equals left behind;
True Son of Mars* a Credit to that Art,
Both ready, and expert in every part:
No danger could affright so great a Mind,
Yet still his Nature, affable and kind.
While in great dangers wonderfully saved,
When many Gallants were of Life bereaved,
Yet fatal Death, by Heavens directing power,
Removed him hence, in his appointed Hour,
In peace (while Young) he was called off the Stage
When in the Spring time of his growing Age.
Confessing Sin his newest breath did spend,
Pleading for Mercy, Praising in the End:
Although that nothing falls out by chance,
But by the course of Divine Providence,
Yet innocents may be brought to their Graves,
By crafty Villans, undermining Knaves,
Who in due time, as Heaven shall find just Cause,
May chance to suffer by the Divine Laws,
Although that Jehu, Acted by command,
Yet Jezerel's blood, was sought at Jehu's hand.
