His Majesty's GRACIOUS SPEECH To both House;es of Parliament.
My Lords and Gentlemen,
HAving lately told you, that it would be necessary for me to go into Holland
much about this time, I am very glad to find that the Success of your
Endeavors to bring this Session to a happy Conclusion, has been such, that I
am now at Liberty to do it; And I return you my hearty Thanks for the great
Dispatch you have made in finishing the Supplies you have designed for carring
on the War, which it shall be my care to see duly and punctually Applied to
that Service for which you have given them: And I do likewise think it proper
to Assure you, that I shall not make any Grant of the Forfeited Lands in
England or Ireland; till there be another Opportunity of Settling that Matter
in Parliament, in such manner as shall be thought most expedient.

My Lords and Gentlemen.
As I have Reason to be very well Satisfied with the proofs you have given Me
of your good affection in this Session of Parliament, So I promise my Self the
continuance of the Same, at your return into your several Counties: And as
every day produces fresh instances of the Restlesness of our Enemies, both at
home and abroad, in designing against the Prosperity of this Nation and
Government Established; So I do not doubt but that the Union and good
correspondence between Me and My Parliament, and My earnest and constant
Endeavors for your preservation on the one hand, joined with the Continuance
of your Zeal and Affection to Support Me on the other, will, by the Blessing of
God, be at all times too Strong for the utmost Malice and Contrivance of Our
common Enemies.

Edinburgh, Reprinted by the Heir of Andrew Anderson, Printer to Their most
Excellent Majesty's, Anno Dom. 1691.
