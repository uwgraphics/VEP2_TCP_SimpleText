The true manner of the life and Death of Sir Thomas Wentworth, late Lord
Lieutenant Deputy of Ireland, Lord General of his Majesty's Army, Knight of
the Noble order of the Garter, who was beheaded the 12. day of this present
month of May, 1641,
The tune is Welladay Welladae.




COuntry men list to me
patiently patiently,
And you shall hear and see,
As time gives leisure,
The object of mishap.
Caught fast in his own trap,
Cast out of fortunes lap,
Through his own folly.
Sir Thomas Wentworth he,
At the first at the first
Rose to great dignity,
And was beloved,
Charles our most gracious King
Graced him in many a thing,
And did much honor bring,
On his proceedings.
Fames Trumpet blasoned forth
His great name, his great name
Lord president of the North,
So was he called,
And as I understand,
He had in Ireland,
A place of great command,
To raise his fortunes.
Mo^e honor did befall,
Unto him unto him,
He was Lord general,
Of the Kings army,
These titles given had he
By the Kings Majesty,
And made assuredly
Knight of the Garter.
But here is the spoil of all,
Woe is me, woe is me,
Ambition caused his fall,
Against all reason,
He did our laws abuse,
And many men misuse,
For which they him accuse,
Quite through the kingdom.
New laws he sought to make,
In Ireland in Ireland,
If he the word did speak,
None durst with stand him,
He ruld with tyranny,
And dealt most cruelly,
To men in misery,
The like was near heard of.
The Second part,
To the same tune.


HE has done thousands wrong
As it is knowao as it is knowae
And cast in prison strong,
Our Kings liege people,
Such cruelty possessed
His black polluted breast,
He thought himself well blessed,
In acting mischief.
But those that clime highest of all
Oftentimes oftentimes,
Do catch the greatest fall,
As here appears,
By this unhappy wight,
Who wronged his Countries right,
And over came by might,
Our good kings subjects.
To London Tower at last,
He was brought, he was brought,
For his Offenses past,
And just deservings,
And after certainly,
He was condemned to dye,
For his false treachery,
Against King and Country.
It being the twelth day
In this month of May,
As true reports do say,
He came to his trial,
The Nobles of our land,
By Justice Just command,
Past sentence out of hand,
That he should suffer.
When the appointed time,
Was come that he should dye,
For his committed crime,
The ax being Ready,
Up to the scaffold he,
Was brought immediately,
Where thousands came to see,
Him take his death.
After some Prayers said,
And certain speeches made,
OF the block his head he laid,
Taking his farewell.
The heads-man bloodily,
Divided presently,
His head from his body,
With he is keen weapon.
Heaven grant, by his downfall
That others may take heed,
Lord send amongst us all,
True peace of conscience,
And may our King and Queen,
Amongst us long be seen,
With all their branches green,
To all our comfort.
