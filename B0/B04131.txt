To His Grace JAMES Duke of Queensberry, His Majesty's High Commissioner, and
most Honorable Estates of Parliament, The Representation of George Lockhart
Merchant in Glasgow, and other Inhabitants of that City.
HUMBLY SHOWS.
THAT Whereas, Their Majestys were Graciously Pleased, to grant a Charter in
favors of the City of Glasgow, which is also Ratified in Parliament, Giving
Power to the said City and Town Council thereof, to Elect their Provost,
Bailies, and other Officers as freely as the City of Edinburgh. Whereby we
humbly Conceive, that the Provost, Bailies, and Council were to be Elected in
the same manner as the other Officers. But by Misunderstanding of the said
Charter and Act of Parliament, there has Creept in an Error in the practice of
Elections, whereby the Merchants and Trades Halls are excluded both from
Leiting and Electing of the Provost or the Bailies, or Choising the Council;
And the said Provost, and Bailies, are Leited and Elected, and the Council
Chosen by the Council of the Preceding Year; As if the said Council were come
in place of the Archbishop, to whom the Nomination of the Provost, and Choice
of the Bailies, out of the Leits presented by the Town Council, only belonged:
And which Practice, We humbly Judge, is Contrar to Our Charter and Act of
Parliament.; And Tends plainly to the perpetuating the Magistracy in a few
hands, Whereas the Election ought to be as free as any other Royal Burghs, and
especially in all Respects as that of the City of Edinburgh.

WE DO LIKEWAYS humbly Represent; That We have suffered by Stenting and
Impositions, under the Name of the King's Cess, Considerably beyond the Quota
Imposed upon the City by Acts of Parliament since VVhitsunday 1693; whereof We
have Subjoined an Account: By which it may appear there has been Exacted 32586
Pound 18 sh: 6 d. more than the King's Cess (not including the Over Stent now
Imposed for Lambass and Martinmass 1700) which is not only a Considerable
Burden of it self, but contrar to Law in manner of exacting, by Quartering,
poinding and Imprisonment: This being Imposed and Exacted without Authority,
and not pretended to by the Town of Edinburgh; We Humbly Beg, The same may be
Redressed and prevented by the High and Honorable Court of Parliament.

May it therefore please your Grace, and Most Honorable Estates of Parliament,
to allow the Merchants and Trades Halls, to have the same Privileges and
Freedom, of Electing the Provost. Bailies, and Council, as they have of the
Dean of Guild, and Deacon-Conveener; And to Discharge any Stenting or Exaction,
but what shall be imposed by Acts of Parliament; which will restore quiet, and
Encourage Industry, among the good Neighbors and Inhabitants of the Town of
Glasgow.

And Your Petitioners shall ever Pray, etc.
