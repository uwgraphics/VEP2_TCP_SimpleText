Love lies a Bleeding.
By whose mortal wounds you may soon understand,
What sorrows we suffer since Love left the Land.
To the Tune of, The Cyclops.




LAy by your pleading
Love lies a bleeding,
Burn all your Poetry, and throw away your reading,
Piety is painted
and Truth is tainted
Love is a Reprobate, and Shism now is Sainted
the Throne Love does sit on,
we daily do spit on,
It was not thus, I was, when Betty ruled in Britain.
but friendship has falter'd
Loves Altars are altered
And he that is the cause, I would his neck were halter'd
When Love did nourish,
England did flourish,
Till holy hate came in, and mades us all so currith,
now every Widgeon
talks of Religion,
But does as little good as Mahomet and's Pigeon
each Coxcomb is suiting,
his words for confuting.
but heaven's sooner gaind by suffering than by disputing
true friendship we smother,
and strike at our Brother,
Apostles never went to God by killing one another.
Let Love but warm ye,
Nothing can harm ye,
When love is General, there is Angels in the Army
Love keeps his Quarters,
and fears no tortures
The bravest fights are written in the book of Martyrs
could we be so civil,
to do good for evil,
It were the only happy way to overcome the Devil,
the flowers Love has watered.
Sedition has scattered
We talk with tongues of holiness, but act with hearts of hatred
He that does know me,
and Love will show me,
Has found the nearest, noblost way to overcome me.
he that has bound me,
and then does wound me,
Wins not my heart, he does not conquer but confound me,
in such a condition
Love is a Physician,
True Love and Reason makes the purest Politician.
but strife and confussion
deceit and delusion
Though it seems to thrive at first will make a sad conclusion.
The second part,
To the same Tune




LOve is a jewel,
A precious jewel,
It Is Love must stinch the blood, when fury fights the duel,
Love is a Blood stone
hate is a Toad-stone,
Heaven is the North-point, and Love is the Lodestone
though fury and scorn
Loves Temples have ^orn.
He Will keep his Covenant, and will not be for sworn.
his Laws do not border,
on strife and disorder,
He scorns to get his wealth by perjury or Marder.
What false-hood drew in,
Grace never grew in
Love will not raise himself upon another ruin,
he can present ye
with peace and plenty
love never advances one by throwing down of twenty,
where Love is in season
there Truth is, and reason
The soul of Love is never underlaid with treason,
he never does quarrel
for Princely apparel
Nor ever fixed a Chair of State upon a barrel.
Love from the dull pit
Or follies full pit
Never took an Anvile out and put it in a Pulpit,
Love is no sinker,
Truth is no slinker,
In mending breaches, Love did never play the Tinkar
where vengeance and lust is
no truth is, nor trust is
As will appear at last in Gods high court of Justice
pity and remorce is
the strength of Loves forces
Paul never converted men by stables filled with horses.
Mercy is fading,
Truth is degrading,
Love is the only cause of Plenty, Peace, and Trading
Love is a fire
made of desire
Whose chief ambition is to heaven to asp
it stops the gradation
of fury and passion
It governs all good families, and best can guide a Nati^^
the low land, the high land,
and my land and thy land
Grew all in common strait, when love had left this Island.
Where Peace is painting
And rage is ranting,
It Is an undoubted sign the King of Love is wanting,
Father and Mother,
Sister and Brother
If love be lacking, quickly mischief one another,
where wrath is, the rod is
that ruins out bodies
With hate the Devil is, but where love is God is,
then let us not doubt it,
but straight go about it
To bring in love again, we cannot live without it.
Then let the Graces
Crown our embraces
And let us settle all things in their proper places,
left Persecution
cause dissolution.
Let all purioyned wealth be made a restitution
For though now it tickles,
'twill turn all to prickles,
Then let us live in peace and turn our swords to sickles,
When Noah's Dove was sent out,
then Gods pardon went out,
They that would have it so, I hope will say Amen to it.
Finis.
