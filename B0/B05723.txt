of the Accounts of Arrears due by the Forces to the Country.
WILLIAM by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland
Defender of the Faith;
To (...) Macers of Our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that
part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Forasmuch as, by sundry former Proclamations Emitted by Us, with Advice of Our
Privy Council, certain days were prefixed to Our Subjects, for bringing the the
several Accounts Due by Our Forces within this Kingdom to them, Stated and
verified in manner mentioned in the said Proclamations: and We being resolved
that none of Our good Subjects should be cut short, and desappointed of the
Payment, of Vhat is justly resting to them by any of Our Forces, by their not
having given in their Accounts to the Clerks of Our Privy Council, before the
days prefixed in the former Proclamations: Therefore We with Advice of the
Lords of Our Privy Council, have thought fit to Prorogat the time for
Verifying, and giving in of the said Accounts to the Clerks of Our Privy
Council, until the fifteenth day of March next to come, and do yet Allow, and
Ordain the Landlords, and others, to whom there are any Accounts resting by Our
Forces, before the first Day of February, One thousand six hundred Ninety one
years; To repair to the Commissioners of Assessment, or any who of them, within
the respective Shires where the said Accounts are resting, and there State and
Verify by writ, Oath or Witnesses, how many Soldiers were quartered on the
said Landlords, or other Persons Creditors, That they advanced of Meat, or
Drink to the Soldiers themselves, or Forage to their Horses, or what they
advanced of Meat,, Drink, Meal, or Malt to Our Garrisons: or what Sums of Money,
either to Our Forces, or Garrisons for their Subsistence, preceding the said
first Day of February, One thousand six hundred Ninety and one: And We with
Advice foresaid, Ordain the said Landlords, or other Persons Creditors, to
give their Oaths, that no part of what they Claim as Due by Our Forces, is
paid to them, and require them to instruct their Accounts fully and clearly
before the said Commissioners, by condescending particularly upon the time,
when the Accounts Were furnished. and also upon the Company, or at least the
Regiment, or Troop, to Whom the Soldiers, or Troopers did belong, and to
insert all the Articles Due by every Regiment, in a Paragraph, or separate
Account by itself though the same was upon the English Establishment, whose
Arrears and Debts to the Country, are to be Stated in Accounts, differently
from these upon the Scots Establishment; And We with Advice foresaid, require
and Command all and sundry Our good Subjects, to whom any Debts are Due by Our
Forces, and Garrisons, for the Causes above-written preceding the Day
abovementioned, to transmit the same with the Verifications thereof, and
report of the Commissioners of Supply thereupon, clearly and distinctly
instructed, and Verified in manner above expressed, to the Clerks of Our Privy
Council, betwixt and the said fifteenth Day of March next to come, to the
Effect, that when ever the foresaids Accounts upon the Scots Establishment,
hereby ordered to be brought in, shall be revised and approven, by the Lords of
Our Privy Council, to whom We earnestly recommend, to dispatch the same with
all Diligence possible: Then the Lords of Our Theasury are with all one
convenience, to give precepts to the Shires, and Burghs and other Creditors in
the said Accounts, upon the Receiver of Our Crown-Rents, for Payment to them,
of the respective Sums that shall be found Due by the Lords of Our Privy
Council, in manner foresaid, out of the Lack Duty of the Pole-mony, appointed
to be paid to him at Candlesmass and Whitsundy next, and Our said Receiver is
to make punctual Payment of the said precepts, after the foresaids Terms, as
he shall be ordered by the said Lords of Our Treasury:and that the Debts of
these upon the English Establishment being so Stated, and distinctly cleared,
may be transmitted to Us; that We in Our Royal wisdom may order such course to
be taken for satisfying the same; as We shall think just. OWR WILL IS HEREFORE,
and We Charge you strictly, and Command, that Incontinent these Our Letters
seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and remnant Mercat-Crosses of
the Head-Burghs of the several Shires within this Kingdom, and there in Our
Name and Authority, by open Proclamation, make Intimation hereof, And Ordains
these presents to be Printed.
