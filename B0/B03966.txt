King VVILLIAM'S Courage and Conquest: TOGETHER, With the Glorious Success of
his Royal Highness the Duke of Savoy; to the Unspeakable Consternation of the
French Court and Kingdom.
To an Excellent New Tune.
Licensed according to Order.

HArk! Hark! Hark! how the mad World,
All Sword and with Fire,
Conspire, Conspire;
Their Forces all Gay,
In Battle Array,
To Combat, to Combat with the Emperor of France,
Yes let them Advance, Advance,
Whilst William, Great William shall dash them in sunder.
And Scurge them with Scorpion Rods,
As Jove drove the Giants down down by his Thunder,
Who Battl'd the Throne of the Gods.
All France, all France is in fear,
Of true Sons of Thunder,
Who under, who under
His Highness's Command,
Has Entered their Land;
Defending their Kingdom will prove but in vain,
Fair Dauphin he soon shall gain:
Thus William and Savoy shall dash them in sunder.
And, etc.
Monsieur, Monsieur Catinat,
Being overpowered,
He scower'd, he scower'd
Before the Savoys,
Stout Conquering Boys,
Which made his whole Army to tremble for fear,
When they with their Duke drew, near;
Thus Savoy great Savoy shall dash 'em in sunder,
And, etc.
Strong Towns, strong Towns they shall yield
To him at discretion,
Oppression, Oppression,
Has caused them to groan,
And therefore they own
His coming is purely to keep 'em from thrall.
French Dragoons shall pay for all,
For Savoy, great Savoy shall dash them in sunder.
And, etc.
His Arms, his Arms with success,
Still clears all before him,
Adore him, Adore him,
The Protestants due,
There Is none but a Crew,
Of Romans, of Romans that does him oppose,
Who only shall feel his blows,
For Savoy, great Savoy, shall dash 'em in sunder,
And, etc.
To Arms, to Arms cries the French,
For the Enemy's coming,
He Is Bombing, he is Bombing,
Our Fortified Towns,
And Conquering Crowns,
Now thus in confusion they march to and fro,
Yet all is in vain I know,
For Savoy, great Savoy shall dash 'em in sunder.
And, etc.
Huzza, Huzza they rush on
Like brave Alexanders,
Commanders, Commanders
Still Leading the way,
In Battle Array,
Tantararo, Tantararo the trumpets do sound,
While Cannons shall tear the Ground,
Thus Savoy, great Savoy shall dash 'em in sunder
And, etc.
Now while, now while he runs on,
Our King with Commanders,
In Flanders, in Flanders,
With Battering Balls
Shall beat down the VValls
Of Dunkirk, of Dunkirk; and make 'em to knm
He fears no Insulting Foe;
Thus William and Savoy shall dash 'em in sunder
And Scurge them with Scorpion Rods,
As Jove drove the Giants down down by his Thunder
And Battl'd the Throne of the Gods.
