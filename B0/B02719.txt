The Distracted Young-MANS Answer TO The Injured Maiden.
Showing the Cruelty of his Parents, in forcing him to marry another, because
she had a better Fortune, which proved the Ruin of the young Man and his
former Mistress.

Te the same Tune: or, The Languishing Swain.
It Is true, thou justly may complain,
On thy unfaithful perjured Swain,
But yet at first I did design,
To marry you, to marry you,
In little time.
I found you beautiful and fair,
Delightful with a pleasing air;
Endowed with all the charms of love,
And I believed, and I believed,
You Would constant prove.
My father told me over and over,
Of one who riches had great store;
He said, If I did not agree,
To court that lass, to court that lass,
He Would own not me.
I went as he did give command,
Although you had my heart and hand;
The God above do know it is true,
I always meant, I always meant;
To marry you.
Our Parents straightways did agree,
And said, That I must married be;
To her they lately wished me to.
Then I replied, then I replied;
What shall I do?
My father said, To Church now go,
A thousand pound this has I know;
For her you courted just before,
She has not half, she has not half;
So much in store.
I answered yea, she has my heart,
Besides me vowed never to part;
Therefore dear father, do not make
Me break this vow, me break this vow;
Which I did take.
He said, If I a thousand took,
I should no more upon her look;
But straight he made me for to go
To Church and wed, to Church and wed,
I know not who.
Although I have a rich young wife,
I have no comfort of my life;
For she that had my heart before,
Will keep the same, will keep the same,
For evermore.
I do implore the God above,
To look upon my injured love,
Who justly does complain on me,
And help her in, and help her in
Her misery.
Then young men all a warning take,
Never break those vows in love you make
If she you love does prove but kind,
Be not like me, be not like me;
To change your mind.
Since I have proved thus untrue;
I bid unto the world adieu,
For I no comfort now can have;
Then death come send, then death come send,
Me to my grave.
