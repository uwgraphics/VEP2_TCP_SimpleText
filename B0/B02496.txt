The PARTICULARS of His HIGHNES'S SPEECH TO THE PARLIAMENT, In the
Painted-Chamber at WESTMINSTER.
HIs HIGHNESS took notice, that the Parliament then met, was such a Congregation
as England never saw, having on their shoulders the Interest of the three great
Nations; and, which is more, the Interest of all the Christian People in the
World.

He promised in what he should say, plainness and truth; taking notice, That
after so many changes and turnings as this Nation has labored under, to have
such day of hope, and such a door of hope opened as this, was some months
since above all our thoughts.

That it might have been a matter worthy such a Meeting, ^o have remembered them
what occasioned the rise and first beginning of all the tossings that have been
upon these Nations, and to have give a f^r^s not (...) of the Providence of God
in (...) to these (...) Grounds of the first under-taking to oppose that
usurpation and tyranny which was upon us in our Civils and Spirituals: but
some reasons diverted him from that, as first, To have proceeded after that
manner, would have taken up the whole day for Gods dispensations have been
such, that as ^avi^ says i^ another case, If I should sit to coun^ them, they
^re more t^e^ can be numbered. 2. Because the recapitulation of his Providen^es
h^^ been largely and w^sely held ^orth ^n the Sermon that ^ay, (...) an
allusion to the ^^te of ^^^d di^pen^^tions ^ward the ^sraelites (the only
parallel t^ Gods de^^ings wit^ us, that he knew in the World) in bringing them
out of Egyp^ through a Wilderness, toward their place of rest. 3. Because the
end of that Mee^ing was ^ealing, and the remembering of former transactio^s
particu^arly, might set ^he wound fresh a-bleeding; and if this day proves not
a day of healing what shall we do? But if it be the mind of God (which alone
must make it healing) to put it into their hearts, then i^ would be such a day,
as generations to come would bless the^ for it.

That it was necessary rather to let them know in what condition these Nations
were, when this Government was erected, what were the breaches in our Civils
and Spirituals, when every man's hand (at least his heart) was against another,
litt^^ appeared tending to cementing. All Gods dispensations, neither his
terrible ones when he met us in a way of Judgment a ten years Civil War, and a
sharp one, nor his merciful di^pensations did work upon us. That we had our
Humors an^ Interests, and (as he feared) our humors were more the^ our
interests, our passions more then our Judgments. Was n^ every thing almost
grown arbitrary? What face was upon (...) Affairs a^ to the Interest and
Authority of the Magistra^^ (...) to the ri^hts ^^d ^^ders of men, whereby
distinctions ha^^ ^^^n man (...) of a Nobleman, a Gentlem^^ Yeoman; it being a
good interest of the Nation, and a great ^ne? Every man's hand was upon his
loins, and said, We see nothing that bears sway or rule. And that spirit that
brought ^t under that contempt, though it may be comprehended in a ^ery short
expression of Men of Levelling, Principles, yet the thing had a vast extention,
tending to reduce all the orders and ^anks of men to an equality, to make the
Tenant of as liberal fortune as his Landlord.

His Highness took notice in the next place, of the prodigi^us contempt upon
God and Christ, and his Ordinances; a spirit visibly act^ng those things which
were foretold by Peter, and Jude, and Timothy, as the lot and portion of the
last ^imes, and something worse then the Antichristian state; that ^here should
be perilous days, and therefore perilous, because ^hey should break all rules,
and labor to root out that remain^er of the Image of God which was left in the
nature of fal^en man: And this by men that should have a form of godli^esse,
denying, the power of it. And indeed the character ^hereby that spirit and
principle is described, is so legible and ^isible, that he that runs may read
it. And he wished that it ^ere not to be read, or seen, and that the grace of
God might ^ot be turned into wantonness, and Christ and the Spirit of God ^ade a
cloak of vile practices.

He observed, That many would not own these things, yet ^hey could tell you,
The Magistrate has nothing to do with ^atters of Conscience or Religion, That
he is to look to the ^uter-man, not to meddle with the inner. And such
pretensi^ns (he said) there were of liberty of the Subject and of Con^cience
(two as glorious things, and as much to be contended ^or, as any gift God has
given us) That both these were ^rought in to patronize those evils; insomuch
that it was af^^rm'd, not to be in the power of the Magistrate so much as to
^rint Bibles, lest it should seem an imposition on the Consci^nces of men, to
receive them from the Magis^rate, as true (...) ^hese abominations swelled to
that (...) ^id to the root of the M^ (...) ^lonish. And as the extremity was
great before, that no man though well approved, and having a good testimony,
might preach, if not ordained; so now on the other hand, they would have
Ordination put a nullity upon the Calling. He took notice of another evil that
had more refinednesse in it, more color for it, and had deceived more people
of integrity then t^^ former; for few were caught with the former mistakes, b^
such as apostatized from their holy profession, such as have been corrupted in
their Consciences, have been forsaken b^ God, and left to noisome opinions. But
there was another thing that deceived many well meaning people, whose hear^ are
sincere, and such as (he was persuaded) belong to Go^ and that is, the Fifth
Monarchy men's pretending to more spir^tuality then any other. It is a Notion,
which (as he hoped we all honor and wait for, That Jesus Christ will have his
ti^^ to set up his Reign in our hearts, and to subdue that corrup^^on and lust
which reigns more in the world now then ever, a^ he hoped in due time it shall
be: But for men to entitle themselves to be the only men to govern Nations,
and rule Kin^doms, and give Laws to the World, to determine of Prope^ and
Liberty, and every thing else, needs a great manifestation Gods presence,
before wise men will submit to it.

Many of those he conceived in his very soul had good me^^ings, and he hoped
this Parliament would (as Jude says, reck^^ing up the abominable Apostacies of
the last times) pluck s^ out of the fire, and save others with fear, making
those peaceable spirits, the subject of their encouragement, and s^ing others
by that discipline, that God has ordained to refo^ miscarriages. The danger of
that Spirit being not in the not i^ but in its proceeding to a civil
transgression. When men s^^ come into such a practice, as to tell us, That
liberty and Pro^^^ty are not the badges of that Kingdom, and that in stead of
^gulating Laws, Laws must be subverted, and perhaps the J^^^cial Law imposed,
or some fancy in stead of it (for that (...) ^ood and honorable in the
Institution, though now by (...) app^^^d specially when every stone is turned
to bri^^ Confusion. This will be a consideration worthy of the Magistrate.

His Highness proceeded to show, That while these things were in the midst of
us, and the Nation rent and torn from one end to the other, Family against
Family, Parent against Child, and nothing in the hearts and minds of men, but
Overturn, overturn, overturn, a Scripture very much abused, and challenged by
all men of discontented spirits. The common Enemy in the mean time sleeps not;
swarms of Jesuits coming over, having their Consistories abroad, to rule all
the Affairs of England, and the Dependencies thereof. In the mean time visible
endeavors are used to hinder the Work in Ireland, to obstruct the Work in
Scotland; Correspondencies and Intelligences are held to encourage and foment
the War in these places. And withal we were deeply engaged in a War with
Portugal, whereby our Trade ceased, and not only so, but a War with Holland,
which consumed our Treasure as much as the Assessment came to. At the same time
we fell into a War with France, or rather we were in it, and all this fomented
by the divisions amongst us, which begat a confidence we could not hold out
long; and the calculation had not been ill, if the Lord had not been gracious
to us.

Besides, strangers increased in the Manufacture, the great staple Commodity of
this Nation. In such a heap of confusion was this poor Nation, and that it
might not sink into a confusion, from these premises a Remedy must be applied.

A Remedy has been applied; This Government, a thing that is seen and read of
all, and which, let men say what they will (he could speak with comfort before
a Greater then they all, as to his own intention, and let men judge out of the
thing it self) is calculated for the Interest of the People; for their Interest
alone, and for their good, without respect had to any other Interest.

He added, That he might with humbleness toward G^^ and modesty before them,
say something in the (...) of it.

It has endeavored to Reform the Laws, and for that end has joined persons
(without reflection upon any) of as great ability and integrity as any other,
to consider how the Laws might be made plain, short, and easy, which may in
due time be tendered.

It has taken care to put into seats of Justice, men of the most known
Integrity and Ability.

The Chancery has been reformed, and (he hoped) to the just satisfaction of
all good men.

It has put a stop to that heady way, for every man that will, to make himself
a Preacher, having endeavored to settle a way for approbation of men of Piety
and fitness for the Work, and the business committed to trusty persons both
of the Presbyterian and Independent judgment, men of as known ability and
integrity, as (he supposes) any the Nation has, and who (he believes) have
labored to approve themselves to God and their own Consciences, in approving
men to that great Function.

It has taken care to expunge men unfit for that work, who have been the
common scorn and reproach of that administration.

One thing more, It has been Isntrumental to call a free Parliament; blessed
be God we see here this day a free Parliament, and that it may continue so, he
hopes is in the heart of every good man of England; and he added, That for his
own part, as he had desired it above his life, so to keep it free, he should
value it above his life.

Having thus instanced in the Wars wherein we were plunged, and the little
assurance from Neighbors abroad, he proceeded to show that a Peace is made
with Sweden (wherein an honorable person was isntrumental) it being of much
importance to have a good understanding with our Protestan^ Neighbors; A Peace
is also made with the Dane; and a Peac^ there that is honorable, and to the
satisfaction of the Merchants. The Sound is open to us, from whence as from
Fountain, our Navall provisions are supplied. That a Peace made with the Dutch
(which is so with known in the consequences of it.) He set forth the advantage
of a good understanding with Protestant States. And he begged that it might be
in the Parliaments hearts to be ^ealous of the Protestant ^nterest abroad,
which if ever it be h^^ to come under a con^^tion of suffering, it is now, many
of them being banished ^^d driven to seek refuge among strangers. That a Peace
is made with Portugal (though it ^^ng long of great come^^ment to Trade; and
the people that Trade ^hi^he I, ^^ve f^eedom to enjoy their consciences without
being subject to the bloody Inquisition. That a Treaty with ^e ^^ce i^ no^
depending.

His Highness added, That it might be necessary for them to hear a little of
the Sea-Affairs, and here took notice of the great expense of the Forces and
Fleet; and yet 30000 l. is ^ow abated of the next three months Assessment.

And so drawing toward a conclusion, he observed, That ^he things before
mentioned are but entrances and doors of ^ope; That they are brought to the
edge of Canaan (into which many that have gone before could not enter.) That if
^he blessing and presence of God go along with them in ma^agement of their
Affairs, he makes no question but he will ^nable them to lay the top-stone of
this work.

But this is a maxim not to be despised; Though Peace be ^ade, yet it is
Interest that keeps Peace; and further then that, ^eace is not to be trusted.

He showed the great end of the calling this Parliament ^as, That the Work of
God may go on. That the Ship ^f this Commonwealth may be brought into a safe
Har^our.

He remembered them that they have a great work upon ^^em; Ireland to look to;
that the beginnings of that Go^^rnment may be settled in terms of Honor, That
they had ^fore them the consideration of those Foreign States which yet Peace
is not made with, who if they shall see we man^ge not our Affairs with prudence
as becomes men, will retain hopes that we may sink under the disadvantages
thereof and break into confusion.

He persuaded them to have a sweet and gracious, and ^^ly understanding one of
another, and put them in mind (...) the council heard that day in order
thereunto.

And desired them for a Conclusion, to believe that spoke not to them as one
that would be a Lord over the^ but as one that was resolved to be a
fellow servants w^^ them to the Interest of this great Affair; and so wished
the^ to repair to their House, and exercise their own Liberty the choice of
their Speaker.

FINIS.
