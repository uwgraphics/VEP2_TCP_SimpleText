Come sweet Lass OR Loves invitation
To a New Tune.
COME Sweet Lass,
it is bonny Weather let us together
Come sweet Lass,
let us trip it on the Grass:
Every where,
poor Jockie seeks his Dear,
Unless that she appear,
he sees no Beauty there.
Hark the Crowd,
the Mirth invites us and delights us
Hark the Crowd,
the Piper plays aloud,
Where all day,
the Lasses sport and play;
And every one are gay
but I when you are away.
But my Smart
it was for Meggie not for Peggie,
Whose hard Heart,
will not kind Lovers part,
Whilst I seek
all Corners for her sake;
Yet will not partake
my Love, tho Heart should break.
There came Kate,
who sung so finely talked Divinely,
Out of date,
because of Pelaflet:
Kate she is afraid,
the Girls no more a Maid,
But sure she is been betrayed
and lost her Maidens-head.
Jenny bright,
with little Francis skips and dances
By this light,
its a very pretty sight,
She is a Lass,
can tumble on the Grass,
Look Sandy in the Face
who brought all these to pass.

A young Man's Resolution to prove constant to his Sweet heart.
To the Tune of, Omnia vincit Amor,
THe Damask Rose or Lilly fair,
the Couslip and the Pansie,
With my true Love cannot compare,
for beauty not for fancy:
The fairest Dame she does excel
in all the World that may be:
Which makes me thus her praise tell,
so sweets the Lass that loves me,
When first I saw her comely face,
I much admired her beauty,
And in my heart I did intend
to proffer her all duty;
Which willingly she did accept,
so kind and loving was she:
Which makes me, sing in each respect,
So sweet's the Lass that loves me.
Bright Cynthia in her richest Rabs,
my Love does much resemble.
Whose beauteous Beams such Rays afford
as makes my heart to tremble,
Her inward parts I much desire,
her outward are so comely,
her Virtues all men does admire,
So sweet's the Lass that loves me:
Her face so fair, her parts so rare,
are past imagination,
All men admire where she abroad
does go for recreation,
But she is chaste as she is fair,
which to her fancy moves me,
Her beauty is without compaire,
So sweet's the Lass that loves me,
Diana and her Virgin Nymphs,
that haunts the Woody Valleys
Free from reasort of play and sport,
and with no Mankind dallies,
Are not so chaste, as is my love.
no creature can disprove me,
But rather help to bear a part,
And swear she is sweet that loves me.
Now to conclude, I ever wish
she may enjoy high pleasure,
And evermore have riches store,
wanting no earthly Treasure,
But while that she and I do live
no creature e're shall move me,
Nor alter once my mind from her,
So sweet's the Lass that loves me.
FINIS
