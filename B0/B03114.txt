Englands Valor, and Hollands Terror: BEING An encouragement for Seamen and
Soldiers to serve his Majesty in his Wars against the Dutch, etc.
Dutchmen beware, we have a Fleet,
Will make you tremble when you see it,
Manned with brave Englishmen of high renown,
Who can and will your Peacocks Plumes pull down;
Then cease your boasting, it will naught avail,
You know its but your duty to strike sail.
To the tune of, The stormy winds do blow.


BRave Loyal Hearted Englishmen,
attend whilst I declare,
What noble preparations is
made for the Hollands War;
For certain such a Bloody Fight
has never been before,
As is near, you shall hear,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
View but our Navy Royal,
and you will find it plain,
The like thereof was never seen
to sail upon the Maine:
The Duke of York high Admiral,
will daunt the Dutchman sore
With his name, and his fame,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
Our Ships are bravely rigged,
and manned with Seamen stout,
And Soldiers good will spend their blood
to bang their Foes about:
They long to be a dealing blows,
delay does vex them sore,
With delight, they will fight,
when the Cannons loud do roar,
The care and good provision
for Seamen that is made,
Will make them fight for Englands right
and never be afraid:
They Will find far richer plunder
then e're they did before:
Every day, in the fray,
when the Cannons loud do roar.


HArk how the Dutchmen bluster,
they prate and Domineer,
They stamp and sweat, they fume and fret,
would make one laugh to hear:
Their Merchants ships are taken
for prizes, grives them sore:
But in vain, they complain,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
Although they be Rebellious,
yet we shall pull them down,
And teach them how they shall submit
to Englands Royal Crown:
We Will thump their sides most soundly
and beat them ore and ore,
In each fight, for our right,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
There will be noble Knocking,
when once the Navy's meet,
Then Hollands States beware your pates
we shall you roughly greet:
Your treachery at Guiny
stands yet upon the score:
You shall pay, at the day
when the Cannons loud do roar.
Then Volontiers come in amain
to fight against the Foe,
For your reward, you shall have gain,
when to the Wars you go;
The Hogan Mogan's for us all,
their riches keep in store:
Then be bold, fight for Gold,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
Brave Allen our Rear Admiral,
it was his hap to meet,
Near Cadiz, on the Spanish coast,
part of their Smyrna Fleet:
Where some he took, and others sunk,
the rest he battered sore,
Thus they lost, and were crossed,
when the Cannons loud did roar.
Then Butter-boxes mark your hitts,
for all your wits are dull,
We Will teach you better manners yet,
then ever did Old Noll:
You then were basted pretty well,
and forced to cry and lower:
And to weep, on the deep,
when the Cannons loud did roar.
We have tall Ships, that is newly built
the best that ere did sail,
We shall the Flemish Vessels pelt,
no doubt we shall prevail:
Our Oaken boards will hold it out
as well now as before;
We 'le not flinch, not an inch,
when the Cannons loud do roar.
Then courage all brave Englishmen,
and never be dismayed,
But fight it out most gallantly,
we shall be nobly paid:
When we return with Victory,
with Gold and Silver store,
Bells shall Ring, whilst we Sing,
and the Cannons loud shall roar.
FINIS.
With Allowance.
