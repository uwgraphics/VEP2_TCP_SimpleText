An excellent new Playhouse Song; called, the bonny Gray-ey'd Morn; OR, Jockie
roused with Love.


To an excellent new Tune.

THe bonny Gray-ey'd Morn began for to peep
when Jockie roused with Love came blithly on;
And I who wishing lay deprived of Sleep,
abhorred the lazy Hours that flow did run.
But meikle were my Joy's when in my View
I from the VVindow spied my only Dear;
I took the VVings of Love and to him flew,
for I had fancied all my Heaven was there.
Upon my Bosom Jockie laid his Head,
and sighing told me pretty Tales of Love
My yielding Heart, at every Word he said,
did flutter up and down, and strangely move:
He sighing, kissed my hand, and vowed and swore,
that I had over his Heart a Conquest gained.
Then blushing begged, that I would grant him more
which he alas! too soon, too soon obtained.
Nor that I do repent, I did comply;
but this I needs must own, my yielding Heart
Was quickly overcome by Jockie's Eye,
which gave a deeper VVound than Cupids dart,
His Cheeks were Cherry red, his Lips the same,
his Tongue so many Charms could still express:
That every word he said did raise new Flames,
and kindled, kindled Fire in my Breast.
My Jockie does a thousand VVays beside,
express himself in tender Love to me:
With Arms about my Waste, he sighing cried,
oh give me thy Consent or I must die,
Then with a gentle Kiss does beg again,
that his poor wounded Heart I would but cure,
Nor thinking that I felt his Lovesick Pain,
for alas! 'twas his, 'twas his before.
And now! I could no longer hide my Pain,
but let my dearest Jockie know my Heart.
Oh, how he hugged me in his Arms again!
and every Kiss he gave did ease my Smart;
Then vowing over and over betwixt each Kiss,
he constant would remain while L^e did last;
Now tell me Lovers; where is the Hurt of this,
for to enjoy, when that the Knot's tied fast?
FINIS.
