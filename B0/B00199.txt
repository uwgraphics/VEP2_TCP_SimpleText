Luke Huttons Lamentation: which he wrote the day before his death, being
condemned to be hanged at York for his robberies and trespasses committed
there-about.
To the tune of Wandering and Wavering.


I Am a poor prisoner condemned to die,
ah woe is me, woe is me for my great folly:
Fast fettered in irons in place where I lie:
be warned young wantons hemp passes green Holy.
My parents were of good degree,
By whom I would not ruled be,
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me,
Receive O sweet Savior, my spirit unto thee.
My name is Hutton, yea Luke, of bad life:
ah woe is me, etc.
Which on the highway did rob Man and Wife,
be warned, etc.
Enticed by many a graceless mate,
Whose counsel I repent too late,
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me, etc.
Not twenty years old (alas) was I
ah woe is me, etc.
When I began this felony:
be warned etc.
With me went still twelve Yeomen tall,
Which I did my twelve Apostles call.
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me, etc.
There was no Squire, nor Baron bold
ah woe is me, etc.
That rode by the way with silver and gold,
be warned, etc.
But I and my Apostles gay,
Would lighten their load ere they went away.
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me, etc.
This news procured my kinsfolks grief,
ah woe is me, etc.
That hearing I was a famous thief,
be warned, etc.
They wept, they waild, they wrung their hands,
That thus I should hazard life and lands.
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me, etc.
They made me a Iailor a little before,
ah woe is me, etc.
To keep in prison offenders sore,
be warned, etc.
But such a Iailor was never none,
I went and let them often every one.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
I wis this sorrow sor^ grieved me,
ah woe is me, etc.
Such proper men shoud hanged be:
be warned young wantons, etc.
My Office then I did ^efie,
And ran away for company.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
Three years I lived upon the spoil,
ah woe is me, etc.
Giving many an Earl the foil
be warned etc.
Yet never did I kill man nor wife,
Though lewdly long I led my life.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
But all too bad my deeds have been,
ah woe is me, etc.
Offending my Country and my good Queen:
be warned, etc.
All men in Yorkshire talk of me,
A stronger thief there could not be.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
Upon S. Lukes day was I borne,
ah woe is me etc.
Whom want of grace has made me scorn:
be warned, etc.
In honor of my birth day then,
I robbed (in bravery) nineteen men.
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me,
Receive, O sweet Savior, my spirit unto thee.
The second part,
To the same tune.


THe Country weary to bear this wrong,
ah woe is me, etc.
With Hues and Cries pursued me long:
be warned etc.
Though long I escaped, yet lo at the last,
At London I was in Newgate cast.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
Where I did lie with grieved mind,
ah woe is me etc.
Although the keeper was gentle and kind,
be warned, etc.
Yet was he not so kind as I,
To let me go at liberty.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
At last the Shrie^e of Yorkshire came,
ah woe is me, etc.
And in a warrant he had my name,
be warned, etc.
Quoth he, at York thou must be tried,
With me therefore hence must thou ride.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
Like pangs of death his words did sound,
ah woe is me, etc.
My hands and arms full fast he bound,
be warned, etc.
Good sir quoth I, I had rather stay,
I have no heart to ride that way.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
When no entreaty would prevail,
ah woe is me, etc.
I called for Wine, Bear, and Ale,
be warned, etc.
And when my heart was in woeful case,
I drunk to my friends with a smiling face.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
With clubs and staves, I was guarded then,
ah woe is me. etc,
I never before had such waiting men:
be warned, etc.
If they had ridden before me amain,
Beshrew me if I had called them again,
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
And when unto York that I was come,
ah woe is me, etc.
Each one on me did cast his doom:
be warned, etc.
And whilst you live this sentence note,
Evil men can never have good report.
Lord Jesus forgive me etc.
Before the Judges when I was brought,
ah woe is me etc.
But sure I had a careful thought,
be warned, etc.
Nine score Inditements and seventeene,
Against me there were read and seen,
Lord Jesus forgive me etc.
And each of those was felony found,
ah woe is me, etc.
Which did my heart with sorrow wound,
be warned, etc.
What should I herein longer stay?
For this I was condemned that day.
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
My death each hour I did attend,
ah woe is me, etc.
In prayers and in tears my time I did spend,
be warned, etc.
And all my loving friends that day,
I did entreat for me to pray,
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
I have deserved death long since,
ah woe is me, etc^
A viler sinner lived not then I,
be warned, etc.
On friends I hoped life to save;
But I am fittest for the grave,
Lord Jesus forgive me, etc.
Adieu my loving friends each one,
ah woe is me, etc.
Think on me Lords when I am gone,
be warned etc.
When on the ladder you do me view.
Think I am nearer heaven than you.
Lord Jesus forgive me, with mercy relieve me,
Receive, O sweet Savior, my spirit unto thee.
L. Hutton.
