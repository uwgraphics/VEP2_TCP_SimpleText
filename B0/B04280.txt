The Taunton Maids delight, OR, Hey for the honest Woosted-Comber.
In Taunton Town a Maid does dwell,
Who loves a Woosted-Comber very well,
In the praise of him she does declare,
No other Tradesman can with him compare.
All Sweethearts that do'h come she does refuse,
Only a Woosted-Comber she does choose,
To him she wishes good prosperity,
For it is a Comber must her Husband be.
T. L.

The Tune is, I have a good old Mother at home, etc.




YOu pretty Maids where e're you are,
come listen unto me,
And briefly to you I Will declare
in every degree,
My choice in choosing of a mate
to you I will unfould,
A Woosted-Comber is the man
that I love better than Gold:
Then hey for the Woosted-Comber brave,
I love him as my life,
ever I a Husband have,
I will be a Comber wife.
Many youngmen to me does resort,
that of several callings be,
With Sugered words they does me court,
to gain true love of me:
But I don't regard what they do say,
of them I make but a jest,
No man shall steal my heart away
from him whom I love best.
Then hey for etc.
Now a true description you shall have
concerning of my sweet hearts,
And how I fitted them most brave
according to their deserts,
Although they strived with might and main
yet I lay at per due,
There Is never a one shall me constrain
to change an old Love for a new.
Then hey for the Woosted-Comber brave
I love him as my life
If ever I a Husband have
I will be a Comber's wife.
The first that to me did make suit,
it was a Barbor brave,
He gave unto me a kind salute,
and said 'twas my love he did crave:
But I made to him this reply,
I will not be married yet,
Your Rayzer and Wishing b^lls truly
for my Basin is not fit.
Then hey for etc.
Then came a Miller unto me,
that was both strong and stout,
He swore that I his wife must be,
but I gave him the rout:
Quoth I, be gone Mr. Loggerhead,
and take this answer in brief,
When it is my fortune for to wedd,
it shall not be with a Thief.
Then hey for the Woosted-Comber brave
I love him as my life,
if ever I a Husband have
I will be a Comber's wife.
Then came a Smith that was cole-black,
and asked me if I would wedd,
He said that a good wife he did lack,
at night to warm his bed:
But I answered him presently
with words plain and downright,
A Blacksmith's hammer never shall
upon my Anvill smight.
Then hey etc.
A prick-louse Tailor he came in,
with his Bodkin, Sheares, and Thimble,
To complement he did begin,
with speeches quick and nimble;
He said if I would be his mate
bravely maintained I should be,
But I told him that Cabbage I did hate,
with my body 'twould not agree.
Then hey etc.
Then came a cold Shooemaker
that was both neat and trim,
He ask't if I could find in my heart
to love and fancy him;
Quoth I, march off with Sir Hugh's bones,
Your suit it is in vain,
For it is not a Shooemaker
that shall my love obtain.
Then hey etc.
An honest Weaver came at last,
and said he would constant prove,
He said he would maintain me brave,
if I would be his love:
He was a handsome proper Lad,
exceeding all the rest,
Of all the six Suitors I had
The Weaver was the best,
Except the Woosted-Comber brave, etc.
Of all sorts of Tradesmen that are
dwelling in Taunton town,
None with a Comber can compare,
for valor and renown:
He is both courageous and stout,
in Battle to sight he is free,
To his enemy he will face about,
he scorns a Coward so be,
Then hey etc.
When he with his Comrades does meet,
his money he will freely spend,
With good strong Beer his heart he will cheer,
to the Ale-wife he is a good friend:
And when he has spent an hour or twain
in merry company,
At the Come-pot again with might and maine,
his work he then ply.
Then hey etc,
Sometimes in the fields with his true-love
a progress he does take,
With kisses sweet he does her greet,
and much of her does make:
On the green grass the time they pass
in sweet felicity,
With heart and mind their loves they bind,
never parted for to be.
Then hey etc.
And thus the Woosted-Comber's praise
I have declared to you,
In every part is his desert,
I have described true,
He is the man that I esteem,
above Rubies or Pearl,
I Would rather choose to lie by him
then by a Lord or Earl.
Then hey etc.
God bless the Combers and Weavers both
that in Taunton does dwell,
Unto them all both great and small
I heartily with well;
To those in Milverton so brave
I also do commend,
Good Trading I wish they still may have,
and so I make an end.
Then hey for the Woosted-Comber brave
I love him as my life
If ever I a Husband have
I will be a Comber's wife.
