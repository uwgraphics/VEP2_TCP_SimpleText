AN Auction of WHORES, OR, The BAWDS BILL of SALE, FOR Bartholomew-Fair. Held
in the CLOISTERS, near SMITHFIELD.
It begins August the 25 th, and continues the whole Time of the FAIR.
Worth the reading of all Single Men and Batchelours.
On Tuesday the 25 th of this Instant August, will be exposed to Sale, by
Auction, a curious Collection of painted Whores, Cracks, Night-Walkers,
Newgate-Nappers, Bridewel-Workers, Ladies of Pleasure, Cart-Dancers; with other
such dissembling Pick-pocket Cheats, some Pox'd, some Clapped, and some quite
rotten and ready to fall in pieces: Some whereof will smile in your faces, and
yet be ready, behind your backs, to cut your Throats for Sixpence. Others will
chuck you under the Chin, with their Left-hands, and with their Right be
picking your pockets. Some will be so drunk, when you carry them to the Tavern,
that they will p -- on your knees, and hug and kiss you at so damnable a rate,
that the stink of their breath will be ready to smother you, and force you to
spew. Others will put one hand in your Cod-piece, and another in your
Watch-pocket. Others will keep you in discourse, till their Partners carry away
your Hat, Cloak, Cane and Gloves Some will spew in your face, when you are busy
with them, whilst you are already half stifled by the stink of their breath.
Who can but buy and love such pretty profitable, and well accomplished Ladies?
Wherein so many such Qualities are concentered.

There will be great variety both of Whores and Tricks, more than I can well
inform you of, at present. But for the satisfaction of the young Sparks, who
yearly frequent the place, I give this account that follows.
