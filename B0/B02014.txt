THE KINGS MAJESTY'S LETTER Direct to the Lords of His Privy Council of the
Kingdom of SCOTLAND.
CHARLES R.

RIght trusty, and right welbeloved Cousins and Counselors, and right trusty
and welbeloved Counselors, We greet you well. We have lately seen a Paper,
presented to Us by the Earl of Lindsay, as a Declaration of the Lords and
Commons, assembled in the Parliament of England, of the seventh of November, to
Our Subjects of the Kingdom of Scotland, which after many high taxes of Us,
and Our Government, very earnestly invites, and in a manner challenges
assistance from that Our native Kingdom, of Men and Arms, for making a War
against Us, making a claim to that assistance, by virtue of the late Act of
Pacification; to the which (out of Our desire to make a perpetual Union
between Our two Kingdoms, for the happiness of both, and by it the more
firmly to establish Our own Greatness and just Power) We cheerfully
consented. As We are at Our soul afflicted, that it has been in the power of
any factious, ambitious, and malicious persons, so far to possess the hearts
of many of Our Subjects of England, as to raise this miserable distemper, and
distraction in this Kingdom, against all Our real actions and endeavors to
the contrary: So We are glad that this rage and fury has so far transported
them, that they apply themselves in so gross a manner to Our good Subjects of
Scotland, whose experience of Our Religion, Justice, and Love (...) People,
will not suffer them to believe those horrible scandals laid upon Us: And their
Affection, Loyalty, and Jealousy of Our Honor, will disdain to be made
Instruments to oppress their native Sovereign, by assisting an odious
Rebellion. We have from time to time acquainted Our Subjects of that Kingdom,
with the Accidents and Circumstances which have disquieted this: How (after all
the Acts of Justice, Grace, and Favor performed on Our part, which were or
could be desired to make a People completely happy) We were driven by the
force and violence of rude and tumultuous Assemblies from Our City of London,
and Our Houses of Parliament: How attempts have been made to impose Laws upon
Our Subjects without Our consent, contrary to the Foundation and Constitution
of this Kingdom: How Our Forts, Goods, and Navy were seized, taken from Us by
force, and employed against Us; Our Revenue and ordinary Subsistence wrested
from Us: How We have been pursued with scandalous and reproachful language;
bold, false, and seditous Pasquils, and Libels, publicly allowed against Us;
and been told, That We might without want of modesty and duty be deposed: How
after all this (before any Force raised by Us) an Army was raised, and a
General appointed to lead that Army against Us, wi^h Commission to kill, slay,
and destroy all such who should be faithful to Us; that when We had been by
those means compelled with the assistance of Our good Subjects, to raise an
Army for our necessary defense, We sent diverse gracious Messages, earnest^y
desiring that the Calamities and Miseries of a Civil War, might be prevented
by a Treaty, and so We might know the grounds of this misunderstanding: How
We were absolutely refused to be treated with; And how at last the Army (raised
as was pretend^d for defense of Our Person) was brought into the Field against
Us, gave Us battle, And (though it pleased God to give Us the victory)
destroyed many of Our good Subjects, with als imminent danger to Our own
Person, and Our children, as the skill and malice of d^sperate Rebels could
contrive. Of all which, and the other indignities which have been offered Us,
We ^^^bt not the duty and affection of Our Scots Subjects will have so just a
refentment, that they will express to the world the sense they h^v^ of Our
sufferings. And Our good Subjects of Scotland are not (We hope) so great
strangers to the affairs of this Kingdom, to believe that this misfortune and
distraction is begot and brought upon Us by Our two Houses of Parliament
(though in truth no unwarrantable Action against the Law can be justified even
by that Authority) they well know how the members of both Houses have been
driven thence; insomuch that of above five hundred members of the House of
Commons, there are not now there above fourscore, and of above an hundred of
the House of Peers, not above fifteen or sixteen: All which are so awed by the
multitude of Anabaptists, Brownists, and other Persons desperate and decayed in
their fortunes, in and about the City of London, that in truth their
consultations have not the Freedom and Privilege which belong to Parliaments.
Concerning any Commissions granted by Us to Papists to raise Forces. We refer
our good Subjects to a Declaration lately set forth by Us upon occasion of that
Scandal, which We send together with this. And for Our Own true and zealous
Affection to the Protestant Religion (the advancement whereof Our Soul
desires) We can give no other instances then Our constant Practice, on which
malice it self can lay no blemish. And those many Protestations We have made in
the sight of almighty GOD, to whom We know We shall be dearly accomptable i^ We
fail in the observation. For that scandalous imputation of Our intention of
bringing in of Foreign Forces, as the same is ^^ised without the least color
^r shadow of reason, and solemnlie dis-avowed by Us, in many of Our
Declarations; so there cannot be a clearer argument to Our Subjects of
Scotland, that We have no such thought, then that We have hitherto forborne to
requi^e the Assistance of that Our Ntive Kingdom, from whose obedience, duty
and affection We should confidently expect it, if We thought Our Own strength
here t^o weak to preserve Us, and of whose courage and loyalty We shall look
to make use, before We shall think of any Foreign Aid ^o succor Us. And We
know no reasonable nor understanding man can suppose our good Subjects of
Scotland are obliged or e^abled by the late Act of Parliament in both
Kingdoms, to obey the invitation which is made to them by this pretended
Declarati^n, when it is so evidently provided for by that Act, That as the
Kingdom of England shall not make War against the Kingd^me of Scotland,
without the consent of the Parliament of England, so that the Kingdom of
Scotland shall not make War against ^he Kingdom of England without consent
of the Parliament of Scotland, And when they have always declared themselves
so careful of Our Honor, Safety, and just Rights, which now undergo such great
violation. This We have thought fit to say upon occasion o^ this late
Declaration, and do recommend it to you the Lords of Our Privy Council of
Our Kingdom of Scotland, To be communicated and published to all Our loving
Subjects there. And if the grave Council and Advice which you derived hither,
by your ^ct of the 22 of April last, had been followed here in a tenderness of
Our Royal Person, and of Our Princely Greatness, and Authority, then would
not this face of Confusion have appeared, which now threatens this Kingdom.
And therefore We requi^e you to use your utmost endeavors, to inform Our
Subjects of that Our Kingdom of the truth of Our condition, and that yo^
suffer not the Scandals and Imputations laid on Us by the Malice and Treason of
some men, to ma^^ any impression in the minds o^ our People, to the lessening
or corrupting their affection and loyalty to Us, But that you assure them the
Hardness We now unde^go, and the Arms We have been compelled to take up, are
for the defense of Our Person, and safety of Our Life, for the mainte^ance of
the true Protestant Religion, for the preservation of the Laws, Liberties and
Constitution of this Kingdom, and for the ^^st Privileges of Parliament. And
We look no longer for the blessing of heaven, then We endeavor the defense,
and advanceme^t of all these. And We doubt not a dutiful concurrence in Our
Subjects; of Scotland in the care of Our Honor and just Rights, will draw down
a blessing on that Nation too.

Given at Our Court ^t Oxford the fifth day of December, 1642.
