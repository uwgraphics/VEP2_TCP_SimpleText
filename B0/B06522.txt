The West-Country Jigg: OR, Love in Due Season.
A Longing Maid which had a mind to marry,
Complaining was, that she so long should tarry;
At length a brisk young Lad did chance to spy her,
And liking of her well, resolved to try her:
And courting her, and vowing to be constant,
They there clapped up a bargain in an instant.
To a pleasant New Tune, called New Exeter.
With Allowance.





WHen Soll with his Beams,
Had gilded the Streams,
And Nymphs, and Young Shepherds
awakt from their Dreams:
I heard a Sad Moan
In a Neighboring Grove
from a Voice all alone.
A Languishing Maid,
By Cupid Betrayed;
Was Sighing, and Sobbing,
And often she said:
Love! Cruel to me:
When shall I be Eased
Of my Misery.
It Is known I am Fair,
And Brisk as the Air;
Not one in a thousand
With Me can Compare:
Yet never a Young Man
Will ease me of Sadness,
to help me! that can.
My time I do spend,
Yet want I a Friend
To Rally, and Dally,
And please me to the End:
Which makes me to say,
O Cupid! Great Cupid!
I love no Delay.




ALL Night in my Bed,
With Cares in my Head,
And weeping, and wailing,
I wish I were Wedd:
And yet no Relief
I find in the Morning
For all my sad Grief.
How happy's the Birds
Which Mate in the Woods?
Enjoying most freely,
Their Love without words;
Whilst I do complain
Of Young-mens Unkindness
And Cruel Disdain.
A Young Man hard by,
This Maid did Espy;
Admiring her Beauty,
He to her did hye:
Quoth he, pretty Saint,
It grieves my Heart for
to hear your Complaint.
What think you of me?
I Am active and free;
And willing to serve you
In every Degree:
And by this sweet Kiss,
To proffer my Service
It is not amiss.
The Bonny Young Maid
was nothing afraid;
But modestly Blushing,
unto him, she said:
Since you are so free,
If you will be Constant,
We two may agree.
Quoth he, thou shall find
Me Loyal, and Kind,
And Ready, and willing
To pleasure thy Mind:
then do you not fear
But I will be Constant
My Joy and my Dear.
this made her Rejoice,
And with Cheerful Voice,
Quoth she, mine own Dearest,
thou shall be my Choice:
take Heart and take Hand,
I always will be at
thy will and Command.
then did they retire,
With Longing Desire;
Expecting, and waiting
For quenching Loves fire:
And now lives most free,
Although a Quick Bargain
was made as you see.
