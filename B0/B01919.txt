Anno Dom. 1699. To the Honorable the COMMONS in PARLIAMENT Assembled: THE
CASE OF The Owners and Masters OF The Transport Ships, that were Employed in
the Reduction of IRELAND.
THAT in the Year 1689, their Ships were taken up for Transporting Forces,
Ammunition, and Provisions, for Reducing that Kingdom to its due Obedience to
His Majesty.

That in the Year 1694, their Accounts were Settled by the Commissioners for
taking and stating the Public Accounts of the Nation; and then amounted to the
Sum of 330769 l. 10 s. 7 d.

That by Virtue of an Act of Parliament, passed in the Seventh Year of His
Majesty's Reign, the Commissioners for Transportation were Empowered and
Directed, to make out Authentic Debentures to all and every the Ships hired
for that Service, which were in Number about 730.

That in the Year 1695, Debentures were made out, and there appeared to be due,
as principal Money, the Sum of 325305 l. 13 s. 2 d.

That Interest for the same, at 5 l. per Cent. has been given on Coffee and
Tea, with Pedlars and Hawkers, from the Year 1695, which expires Midsummer 1701.

Wherefore, since there is a Bill depending before this Honorable House, for
the applying the Forfeited Estates and Interest in Ireland to the use of the
Public; and so many Families unto whom the Debt is due, being reduced to a
very poor Condition, for want of Payment. It is humbly hoped the Transport
Ships that carried the Army over, shall have some Relief from the same; or in
what other way shall seem meet to the Wisdom of this Honorable House.

CASE Of the Owners and Masters of the Transport Ships that were Employed in
the Reduction of Ireland.
