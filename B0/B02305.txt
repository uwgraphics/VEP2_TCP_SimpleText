AT EDINBURGH, The 9th Day of July, 1696.
THE COURT OF DIRECTORS of The Company of SCOTLAND Trading to AFRICA and the
INDIES, Finding that the nature and course of their Trade, will always Require
considerable Sums of Money to be in their Demand; And considering how
profitable, easy and convenient it will be to the Proprietors of the
Joynt-Stock, as well as beneficial to the Trade, Credit and Improvements of the
said COMPANY, to have the greatest part of the Money Advanced by the
Proprietors thereof, to be unto them a quick and living Stock, and always at
Command; The said COURT OF DIRECTORS do hereby Resolve, Agree and Declare, That
the several Proprietors of the said Joynt-Stock, upon their Respective Bills or
other Obligations payable in Three Months, shall always have Credit upon their
respective Stocks in the said COMPANY, for any Sum not exceeding Two third
Parts of the Money severally paid in by them, paying only for the same an
Interest at the rate of Four per Cent. per Annum: And such Sums may be Repaid
to the COMPANY, in part, or in whole; and the Interest thereof, shall only be
reckoned for the Days that such Sums, or Parts thereof shall happen to remain
Unpay'd, and for no longer time.
