An Excellent new Song, Called The Fairy Queen, OR, The merry Companions,
^ ^ ^ ^

SIng, sing whilst we trip it, trip trip it,
trip trip it upon the Green,
Let no ill vapors rise or fall
Let no ill Vapors rise or fall,
No nothing, no nothing offend,
Let nothing offend our Fairy Queen,
Let nothing, let nothing, let nothing,
Let nothing offend our Fairy Queen.
The Queen is a coming, come coming,
Come coming with all her Train,
Lets hand and Dance a Round for Joy,
Lets hand and dance a Round for Joy
While Music, while Music does sound
While Music does sound upon the Plain,
While Music, while Music, while Music
While Music does sound upon the Plain.
Now let us be singing, sing singing, sing
singing in praise oath Queen,
Her beauty does excel the World,
Her beauty does excel the World,
No Goddess, no Goddess so fair,
No Goddess so fair is to be seen,
No Goddess, no Goddess, no Goddess,
No Goddess so fair is to be seen.
All Joy to the fair one, the fair one,
The fair one our Gracious Queen,
She is the chief of Loves delight,
She is the chief of Loves delight,
Let no one, let no one offend,
Let no one, offend her on the Green,
Let no one, let no one, let no one,
Let no one offend her on the Green.
Come, let us all follow, fol follow, fol
Follow our Queen each way,
Let it be to the Woods or Plain.
Let it be to the Woods or Plain,
We Will trip it, we will trip it along,
We Will trip it along till break of day,
We Will trip it, we will trip it, we will trip it,
We Will trip it along till break of day.
