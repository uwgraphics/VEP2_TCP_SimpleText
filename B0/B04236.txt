The loving Chamber Maid. Or, Vindication of a departed Maidenhead.
Being the Art to lie with a Man and yet be a Virgin.
To a New Tune
Maidens -- but Ah what is a maid I pray
An infant Female that scarce views the day,
For e're the things we Virgins call aspire
To 13 years, they feel a strange desire:
Longing for what themselves can scarcely tell,
Which strange desire of make their bellies swell
And then what it is they know too fatal well.




SHut the door after me,
pull off the Boule,
I Will blow in the Candle
the best of you all,
And all the World
shall never me persuade,
But that I Am a maid,
Ay a very good maid.
I never lay with any
unless it were one,
And yet I dare venture
or look at the Sun,
And all the world etc.
I had but one small one,
what am I the worse
I never gave it Suck
but I put it to Nurse,
And all the world etc.
Perhaps 'twas my Master
that got it, what then,
My Mistress never knew on it
nor none of our men,
And all the world
shall never me persuade,
But that I Am a maid
Ay a very good maid.
For I can pass current
and sell it again,
To some Fopp o'th City
who never yet was in,
And all the world
Although my Maidenhead
sporting took flight,
With heaving and thrusting
I bid it good night
Yet all the world
And if I be clapped too
then what of all that,
Some Country Clown
will be baiting his Cat.
And all the world
It Is a known was Marime
from ages long track'd,
A Chamber Maids simple
unless she be cracked.
Then all the world.
For she is not fitting
good counsel to keep,
When Light-heels her Mistress
with Gallants does sleep,
Then all the world
Tho I should my Mothers
black Legacy pawn,
To some doting Broker
for rigging of Lawn.
Yet all the world
For tho the did doatard
should flutter a while
He could not the fashion
at Margery spoil.
Then all the world
Nay tho I should deal
with a blade of the Town
A Squire to Venus
should tumble me down.
And tho he long struggled
yet none should persuade
But that I Am etc.
For she is a mean Strumpet
that knows not the tricks,
To try with one Maiden-heats
dozens of --
Then all the world
shall never me persuade,
But that etc.
The famous Matronas
of Whetstone will tell
That they can a Maidenhead
sixty times sell,
Then all the world
When Cook-maids by Prentices
often are beguiled
And packed in the Country
when pregnant with child.
And after delivery
none them persuades
But that they are maidens,
pass current for maids.
Once having a smatch
to trading they fall,
Set up with a Maidenhead
common to all.
And keep open Warehouse,
then none shall persuade, etc.
There Is none above fifteen
but if they are put to it,
Although they deny you
will willingly do it.
Therefore no Gallant
shall e're me persuade,
but that as maids go
I Am a very good maid.
