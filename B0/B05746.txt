PROCLAMATION, Anent Production of the Tacks of the Teinds of the Bishoprics.
FORASMUCH as His Sacred Majesty, by His Letter of the Date the 24 day of April
last, Did signify to the Lords Commissioners of His Thesaury, that it was His
Royal Pleasure they should Farm the Bishops Rents by way of Roup, and that to
one or more Persons, as might be most for His Majesty's Advantage: And did also
Declare His Gracious Inclination for the Ease of His People, that a Sum should
be Agreed upon, to be Paid at the Renewing of the Tacks of Teinds of the said
Bishoprics, and that the first Offer thereof should be made to the Heretors.
And seeing that before the Roup go on, it is necessary to know if the Tacks
thereof formerly Set by the Bishops be Expired or not. Therefore the said
Lords Commissioners of Their Majesty's Thesaury with Advice and Consent of the
Lords of Exchequer, have thought fit to Delay the same, until the First Day of
November next to come; to the effect that all Heretors and others, who have
Tacks of Teinds from the said Bishops, may Produce them to the Clerks of
Exchequer, betwixt and the First Day of October ensuing, and whereunto they are
hereby Required. Certifying such as shall Failzie therein, that the Collectors
or Tacksmen of the Bishopric Rents, will proceed to uplift the said Persons
their Teiths ipsa corpora, or Pursue for the Value thereof. And that none may
pretend Ignorance, Ordains these Presents to be Printed and Published at the
Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and the other Head-burghs of the respective Shires
of this Kingdom.
