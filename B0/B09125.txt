AN EPITAPH. On the Worst, and most Wicked of all Mankind, C. I. Who Dyed on
the 6th. of June. 1681.
THE veriest Villain e're was born,
The Goodmans great Contempt and Scorn
Lies here Interred, if BELZEBVB
Ha'nt Pickled him in's Powdring-Tub.
His Name was Kit, a Rogue (to tell
The Truth) worse than ACHITOPHEL:
His Birth was base, and what more odd is,
His Dad a Maker was of Boddice;
Or as some Learned Men will have it,
The Evidence of an Affidavit.
Nor did his Son Degenerate,
Who was far worse, I know not what:
A Pimp well known to every Harlot;
A Pettifogging Paultry Varlet;
A Rogue in Grain, though not in Scarlet,
Since he never had the Grace to blush at
Those Crimes he only made a push at.
He was a Knave made up of strife,
A Mischief-maker all his Life;
An Hand-Granada, to Inflame
And scatter Coals where e're he came.
But mark! Those Coals this busy Elfe
Scattered abroad, consumed himself
To Cinders, who Dyed, which you please,
Of the POX, or Foul Disease.
Yet were the Fates in one thing kind,
In striking him beforehand Blind,
That he might not behold, or view
That Shame his Sins had brought him to.
This ( Reader,) in great haste I writ,
That thou at leisure may Learn Wit,
And warning take by Cursed Kit.
London, Printed by G. L. for the Author. 1681.
