The Downfall of Pride. Riband-Cod-pieses, Black-patches, and whatsoever is
Antic, apish, fantastic, and dishonorable to a civil Government.
To the Tune of, Bragandary.


A Ballad, a Ballad, lets make in have,
a Ballad lets make with speed,
Let every Poet make a verse,
for there never was more need
Men and women are out of their wits,
Possessed with strange frantic fits,
O people, monsterous people,
What do you mean to do?
Some carry about them every day,
a Habberdashers shop,
Like Puppets in a Puppet-Play,
about the streets they hop;
Just against the place of lust,
With gaudy Ribbons they are trust,
O men, monsterous men,
What do you mean to do?
Some women sometimes use to wear,
black Patches on their face,
What ever of themselves they think,
it is but to their disgrace:
They make themselves with those fond toys,
A laughing stock to girls and boys,
O women, monsterous women
What do you mean to do?
The civil Soldiers laugh at ye,
to see you so disguised,
And I do hope to live to see,
Pride not so highly prized,
Costly Baubles you have store,
But never a penny for the poor,
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do?
If that the fashion should be now
great Garlands for to wear
As Paris-garden Bulls have done,
our people would not forbear:
they would wear them about their necks
To pride they give such great respects,
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do?
Or if the fashion should be now,
As I may well suppose,
That points and Ribbons should be worn
in men and women's nose,
Pride would quickly have it so,
That they like Anticks thus might go,
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.


OR if the fashion should be now,
on shoes to wear great beads,
Or if some people should but wear
hand-baskets on their heads:
The rest will follow them I know
that they like Coxcombs thus might go
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do?
Or if the fashion should be thus
to wear the ears of Pigs,
In women's breasts or on their heads
As men wear Perrywigs:
Pride will give that fashion place,
The Pigs would go to wrack a pace,
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do?
Curled locks are daily sold
to women for to wear,
An ugly sight for to behold.
'to see them wear false hair,
Women and men fantastic Elves,
Know not what to wear themselves,
O people, etc,
Men with white Powder, powder their hair
they look like Millers right
What coulor soever their clothes are
the Powder makes them white:
Boots they wear with a picket-toe,
Stradling through the streets they go,
O men, etc.
Our Ancestors were civil men
As we may read and hear;
Though they were men of good account,
would leather shoo-strings wear,
Their hands unto their shirts were sown
But now we are more gallant grown,
O people, monsterous people
what do you mean to do.
A Leather-Girdle about their waste,
as plain as plain may be,
An honest heart within their breast,
from guile and falsehood free?
No Bills nor Bonds betwixt them then,
But now we live more like Devils then men
O people, monsterous people,
what do you mean to do?
What I have said good people all
is mearly out of love,
I do desire that great and small
may fear the Lord above:
That cruelty and pride may cease,
And that we may enjoy true peace.
That Pride may be overthrown,
And charity take place.
FINIS.
