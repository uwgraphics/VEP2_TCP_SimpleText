CERTAIN ADVERTISEMENTS AND Articles, given by the Worshipful Master Robert
Johnson Archdeacon of Leicester.

In the Visitation holden for the said Archdeaconrie, at the feast of the
Annunciation of our blessed Lady the Virgin MARIE in the year of our Lord
God 1613. and of the Reign of our most gracious Lord King JAMES, by the grace
of God of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, etc. the
eleventh, and of Scotland the forty five.

LONDON Printed for Ambrose Garbrand. 1613.

The use of the Ecclesiastical Visitations.
Ordinary Visitations Ecclesiastical by what authority soever executed, were
originally instituted and ordained for the honor of God, the good of his
Church, and the preservation of the people of God in unity of true Religion,
and in holiness of life and conversation, and that the Churches Parochial and
other founded and erected for divine worship, might by Ecclesiastical
Magistrates and Church-gouernours in their distinct callings be furnished with
reverent and discreet Ministers, godly and learned Preachers, faithfully to
teach and instruct the people in the truth of Gods word, sincerely to
administer the Sacraments, and to do and perform all other offices of the
holy Church, by name Matrimony, visiting the sick, burial of the Dead,
thanksgiving of Women after childbirth, and such like, according to the
positive Laws and Ordinances of Christian Kings and Princes, Gods Vicegerents
on the earth, without any Antichristian corruption, Schismatic innovation of
addition of their own. And further that in due execution, or such Visitations,
the enemies of Gods truth, the Papal, Schismatic, Anabaptisticall, profane
or other, might be reformed or expulsed Gods Church: All idle and dissolute
Ministers (being insufficient and a scandal to their calling) removed and
displaced, and men or better sort, sobriety and worthiness, placed in their
stead: and that the people who are many times careless and negligent to be
instructed, and often seduced to follow innovation and strange worship, might be
reduced from their errors and superstition, either by godly exhortation and
persuasion, or otherwise by the censures of the Church. This divine and very
necessary inquisition by the providence of God and in wisdom of former times
gravely ordained being duly executed by the Magistrate, Minister,
Churchwardens, and such other as are trusted in this business, would
doubtless God assisting easily purge the Church of many inconveniences, and
bring the people to better obedience, and more due acknowledgement of the
benefits bestowed upon them, in placing over them so renowned, sacred and
religious a Prince, and in giving unto them by his sole wisdom and authority
under God, liberty to serve God, and to live at home in peace.

An Advertisement.
Thanksgiving for benefits and graces received, and daily invocation of Gods
holy name for the continuance of his blessings toward us, and for the
protection and defense of this Church, Prince, and People, from the rage,
oppression, and violence of Satan and his members, as it is particularly
commanded in many places in holy writ, so it is warranted unto us by all
examples of the Prophets and Patriarchs in all ages, and therefore since we
have as good cause as ever nation had to prostrate our selves before the
Majesty of the Almighty for the infinite blessings brought upon us, in
placing over us so religious, sacred and godly a Prince, as no Chronicle can
ever mention, neither any Kingdom or people ever had: let us therefore
seriously, yea let us sincerely even from the bottoms of our hearts acknowledge
with all thanksgiving the good received, which we ought even of our own accord
to do: yet much more when we are commanded by public authority. And therefore
for as much as we are by certain statutes, proclamations, letters, and
ordinances required, enjoined and commanded, to celebrate the day of his
Majesty's Coronation, and of his wonderful deliverance from that bloody
conspiracy of that family of the Gowries, as also from that most horrible,
treacherous and unspeakable action of that Antichristian, hellish and most
damnable plot and practice lately intended, not against the person of his
Majesty only, but to the quite extirpation and subversion of his royal
issue, Religion, and the whole state of this Kingdom: it behooves every
Minister and all Church Officers, be they Churchwardens or other, as they
tender their duty to God, their allegiance to their Prince, and their
obedience to the laws established, to provide that in their several Parishes
and Cures, all solemnity be had of the day of his Majesty's Coronation, and
all public prayer be used according to the prescript form set forth by
authority as well the fifth of August, as upon the fifth of November, and that a
particular note be given by the Minister and Churchwarde^s of al such as shall
refuse to come to Church those days: and for their better admonition it is
required that the Minister do make known unto the people upon the precedent
Sunday the several days as they shall happen to fall.

Church recusants enemies to Gods truth, to be presented.
1 Church-Recusants, as it is a name heretofore seldom or never heard of, so
are they in the condition and practice of their life, known enemies of Gods
truth, such as hate to hear the word, or partake the Sacraments, and live in
open contradiction and opposition against the laws of God, and against the
laws of their Christian Prince and Common-welth. These persons being justly
reputed very dangerous subjects and offensive members in the Church, are by the
Minister and Churchwardens with all care and diligence to be enquired after,
and presented by their known names and surnames, with addition of their
titles, and with declaration of what power and sufficiency they are, and what
office they bear in the Church and Commonwealth, which presentment so made is
to be subscribed and delivered under the hand of the Minister, Churchwardens
and Sworn men.

Admonishment to be given such as refuse the Sacrament, and after upon refusal
to be presented.
2 Where sundry persons who have been heretofore Recusants, do now of their
own accord frequent the Church, though not so usually as others, and yet
refuse to hear the word preached, or to receive the Sacrament of the Lords
Supper the better thereby to confirm them, and to give testimony unto others
by those their outward actions of that their inward zeal, devotion and
conformity, it behooves the Minister and Churchwardens in like sort, first by
godly admonition to persuade the said persons if so they can, to receive, or
otherwise to present all such as shall obstinately refuse, being of the age of
sixteen years and above, least their sufferance and permission of them become
an offense unto the godly, and give others cause by their example to backslide.

Wives, Children, and Families of reformed Recusants not communicating ought to
be presented.
3 Though sundry Recusants have of late conformed themselves, and do now come
to the Church to hear divine prayer, and to receive the Sacraments, as by the
laws of God, and of this Realm they are commanded: yet the wives, children,
and family of many of those reformed Recusants do notwithstanding still
continue obstinate, and will not be drawn either by the example of the
husband, parent, or master, nor by any other godly persuasion or conference to
do and perform what to them and every of them in a Christian duty to God and
the Prince belongs. For reformation whereof the Minister, Churchwardens, and
Sworn-men are to take a true note and particular of every such person in those
families as shall refuse to come to Church, or to receive the Sacraments, being
of lawful age and having no just impediment, shall accordingly present them.

4 The infection of Recusancy being the very fruit and badge of Antichristian
irreligon, has been a surfeit so long and dangerous in this Kingdom, as by
the daily increase of such as affect those dregs of Popery, the disease and
contagion seems in it self incurable, and the rather for that the several
houses of Recusants here infected for the better strengthening of that cause as
is supposed, Marriages of Recusants and their children not publicly
solemnized, to be presented.
do usually couple and join themselves in Matrimony together, and so are
grown by that union and conjunction to a great strength and kindred; now for
as much as these marriages are most times in private houses celebrated without
any public license or banes asking: and the Children likewise begotten betwixt
such persons are seldom or not at all in public baptized: It is thought fit
and very convenient, that the Minister and Churchwardens of every Parish do
very carefully inform themselves of all such marriages so supposed to be had
and of all such Children so baptized, that the several persons herein Culpable
may be presented, and compelled to prove by lawful testimony their several
marriages, that their Children are baptized according to the Ordinances of the
Church now established, or otherwise to endure such punishment and penalty as
by the laws Ecclesiastical of this Realm in such case is religiously
provided: the law it self requiring a due and perfect register continually to
be kept by the Minister and Churchwardens, of all marriages and Christenings
had within the Parish, and to be yearly sent into the Bishops Register there
to be recorded.

5 Now for the avoiding of the future evil which may happen in such case, it
is required that the Churchwardens and sworn-men of every Parish do inquire
and inform themselves what Ministers other then ehe Parochial Minister does
usually celebrate divine service, Strange Ministers and Scholemasters
frequenting the houses of Recusants to be presented.
administer the Sacraments and perform other Church Offices, in those private
Families, and whether the said person so executing such offices be a Minister
licensed, and have subscribed to the Articles of Religion, and if not to
present him; and further what schoolemasters the said families being noted for
Recusancy have to teach their Children, and what license the said
schoolema^sters have so to do, for that many transformed Jesuits, and
Seminaries, under the name and color of schoolemasters, do usually frequent
such places, and in the Cloak and covert thereof do exercise al their
superstitious service and Idolatrous practices.

6 For as much as some pretend and have informed (as it seems) the Kings most
excellent Majesty and the Honorable Lords and other of his Highness privy
Council, All excommunicate Recusants upon Oath for conformity to be absolved.
that sundry Recusants being excommunicate persons would willingly come to the
Church and receive the Sacrament in case they might obtain their absolution
from the sentence of excommunication inflicted, it is thought fit and hereby
required that the Ministers of every Parish, Chapel, or Hamlet, within this
Dioces do forthwith, or so soon as with conueniency they may, give public
notice in the Church or otherwise to the persons themselves or at their mansion
houses, that if they will come to the Ordinary who did excommunicate them, or
being not able to come will procure commission to be granted for their better
ease to their particular Minister, and take oath for their after-conformitie,
they shall be absolved without fee: so as they have committed no other offense
which does deserve some public reformation or satisfaction to the congregation.

7 Lastly for as much as Schism and division in Religion and in the Ceremonies
of the Church has and does much disturb the peaceable government of the same,
One uniform order of Common prayer, etc. wherein default is to be presented.
and does likewise give great occasion to the professed enemies of Gods truth
thereby to withdraw the people and such as are weak from the Religion,
doctrine and discipline of the Church now established, for that we are not (as
they pretend unto them) at unity within our selves, it is very necessary and
behouefull, that sithence it has pleased the Kings most excellent Majesty by
his late Canons exemplified under the broad seal of England, to decree and set
down that one uniform order in the execution of divine service and in ye
administration of the Sacraments, of apparel, as of Church ornaments and
Ceremonies, should be used by the Clergy of this Kingdom, as well in the
public execution of those their particular offices as in other their outward
conversation and behavior, that the same be accordingly used and provided, or
else that the Church wardens do present whether the fault be in the Minister
who will not wear the same, or in the Parishioners who will not provide those
ornaments necessary and commanded.
