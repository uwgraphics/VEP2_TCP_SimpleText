The Man in the Moon drinks Claret, As it was lately sung at the Curtain Holy
well to the same tune.


BAcchus the Father of drunken Nowles,
Full Mazers Beakers Glasses bowls
Greasy Flapdragons flemish Vpsie freeze
With healths stabbed in arms upon naked knees
Of all his wines he makes you tasters,
So you tipple like Bumbasters.
Drink till you reel a welcome he does give,
O how the boon Claret makes you live,
Not a painter purer Color shows,
then what is laid on by Claret
Pearl and ruby both set oot the nose
when thin small beer does mar it.
Rich wine is good,
It heats the blood,
It makes an old man lusty,
The young to brawl.
And Drawers up call,
Before being too much musty,
Whether you drink all or little,
Pot it so your selves you whitle,
Then thought twelve
A clock it ^e
Yet all the way go roaring,
If the hand,
Of bills cry stand.
Sweats that you must a whor --
Such Gambols, such tricks, such F^garies,
We fetch though we touch no Canaryes,
French wine till the welkin roares,
And cry out a pox of your scores.
In wine we call for bawdy Iiggs,
Catzoes, Rumbiloes, Whirligigs,
Crambo got in the huff-cap vain.
The Devil in the places you wot where reign
Brave wine it is thus tickles our heels,
Mull'd well in wine none sorrow feels.
Our Moon man and his Powder beef mad crew
thus caper through the liquor sweet turnep drew
Round about over tables and joined stools,
lets dance with naked Rapiers.
Cut the fidle strings and then like fools,
kick out the fum fum scrapers,
There is no sound,
The cares can wound
As lids of wine pots clinking
There Is no such sport
When all amort
Man cry lets fall to drinking,
O it is nappy geer,
would each belly was filled here
Herrings pickel'd
Must be tickel'd,
Down to draw the liquor,
The salt Sammon
And fat Gammon,
Makes your wine drink quicker,
Our man in the Moon drinks Claret,
With Powder beef turnep and Carret,
If he does so why should not you
Drink wine until the Sky looks blew,
Hey for a turn thus above ground hey,
O my noddle too heavy does way,
Metheglin Perry Syder nor strong Ale,
Are half so heavy be they nere so stale
Wine in our guts can never ruuthle,
Down now and than though it make us stumble
Yet scambling up a drunkard feels no pain
But cries sir boy the other pottle again,
We can drink no more unless we have
full pipes of Trinidado,
Give us the best it keeps our brains
more warm then can frezado.
It makes us sing,
And cry hey jing,
And laugh when Pipes lie broken
For which to pay
At going away,
We scorn a Mustard Token.
Never curse the saucy score
Out swear the bar you will pay no more.
In these days
He is no Gallant,
That cannot puff and swagger
Though he dare not kill a sheep,
Yet out must fly his Dagger.
If then you do love my Oast Claret,
Fat Powder beef turnep and Carret,
Come again and again
And still welcome Gentlemen.
