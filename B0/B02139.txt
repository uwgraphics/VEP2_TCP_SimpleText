Cheat upon Cheat, OR, The Debaucht Hypocrite.
Being a True Account of two Maidens, who lived in London near Fish-street, the
one being named Susan, the oaths Sarah, Susan, being dressed in Man's Apparel,
Courted Sarah, to the Great Trouble of the deceived Damsel, who thought to be
pleasur'd by her Bridals Nights Lodging as you may find by the sequel.

When Maidens come to Love and Dote.
And want the use of man,
Against their wills they needs must shew't
Let them do what they can.
To the Tun of, Tender hearts of London City.


COme and hear the strangest Story,
Ever Fortune laid before ye,
of a wedding strange but true,
For such a one was never known,
as I will now declare to you.
There was two maids in London-City
One was wanton 'tother witty;
Sue and Sarah were their Names,
It does appear they married were,
and Sarah tasted Cupids flames.
A Gentleman that lived nigh 'um,
Had a mighty mind to try 'um,
and this Susan did engage,
That she would go and Court her so,
that she her passion might assuage,
Disguised went she, and fell to wooing
Sarah she would needs be doing,
so she quickly gave consent,
They soon agreed to match with speed,
but now poor Sarah does lament.
Susan strangely was disguised,
Sarahs heart was soon surprised,
so that she did condescend,
She never denied to be a Bride,
but her young Lover did commend.
While her joys were thus completed,
Sarah was extremely cheated,
which did make her vitals fail,
To bed they went with joint consent,
and she found a Cat without a Tail.


Now is Sarah much concerned,
But by this some wit she Learned,
though she for it paid full dear,
For from her eyes, with fresh supplies,
down trickles many a brackish tear.
Sarah thought love her befriended,
Tow but mark what this attended,
and twill make you much admire,
That Susan she, so arch should be,
to set poor Sarahs heart on fire.
With Sword and Wigg was Susan dressed
Sarah thought that she was blessed,
with a Gallant none more fair,
But pity 'twas, a wanton Lass,
should be so much mistaken there.
Now is Sarah discontented,
Her mifortune much lamented,
Maidens then pray have a care,
Lest Susan comes with Sugar plums,
to bring poor damsels into a snare.
Quoth Sarah why would you abuse one,
Whom yuo loved deceitful Susan,
why would you me thus betray,
Oh then quoth she, 'tvvas jollitry,
that made me thus the antic play.
Let no one know how you miscary'd,
How mistaken when you married,
for twill make the world to laugh,
You walked your round, and then you found
a Constable without a Staff.
Wonder not why this I write you,
To be merry I invite you,
and to none I harm do think,
Let Sarah grieve, Sue did deceive,
which made poor Sarahs heart to sink.
To all Maids let this be a warning,
All are wise that still are learning,
Beauty is a mere decoy,
Then have a care, least Cupids snare,
do make you curse the blinking Boy.

London Bridge.
