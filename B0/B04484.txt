NEWS from the COFFE-HOUSE; In which is shown their several sorts of Passions,
Containing News from all our Neighbor Nations.
A POEM.
YOu that delight in Wit and Mirth,
And long to hear such News,
As comes from all Parts of the Earth,
Dutch, Danes, and Turks, and Jews,
I Will send ye to a Rendezvous,
Where it is smoking new;
Go hear it at a Coffe-house,
It cannot but be true.
There Battles and Sea Fights are Fought,
And bloody Plots displayed;
They know more Things then ere was thought
Or ever was betrayed:
No Money in the Minting-house
Is half so Bright and New;
And coming from a Coffe-house,
It cannot but be true.
Before the Navyes fall to Work,
They know who shall be Winner;
They there can tell ye what the Turk
Last Sunday had to Dinner;
Who last did Cut Du Ruitters Corns,
Amongst his jovial Crew;
Or Who first gave the Devil Horns,
which cannot but be true.
A Fisherman did boldly tell,
And strongly did avouch,
He Caught a Shoal of Mackarel,
That Parley'd all in Dutch,
And cried out Yaw, yaw, yaw Mynt Here;
But as the Draught they Drew,
They Stunk for fear, that Monck was there,
Which cannot but be true.
Another Swears, by both his Ears,
Mounsieur will cut our Throats;
The French King will a Girdle bring,
Made of Fla^-bottom'd Boats,
Shall Compass England round about,
Which must not be a few,
To give our Englishmen the Rout:
This sounds as if, it were true.
There Is nothing done in all the World,
From Monarch to the Mouse
But every Day or Night it is hurld
Into the Coffe-house.
What Lilly or what Booker can
By Art, not bring about,
At Coffe-house you will find a Man,
Can quickly find it out.
They Will tell ye there, what Lady-ware,
Of late is grown too light;
What Wiseman shall from Favor Fall,
What Fool shall be a Knight;
They Will tell ye when our Failing Trade,
Shall Rise again, and Flourish,
Or when Jack Adams shall be made
Churchwarden of the Parish.
They know who shall in Times to come,
Be either made, or undone,
From great St. Peters-street in Rome,
To Turnbull-street in London;
And likewise tell, at Clerkenwell,
What Whore has greatest: Gain;
And in that place, what Brazen-face
Does wear a Golden Chain.
At Sea their Knowledge is so much,
They know all Rocks and Shelves,
They know all Councills of the Dutch,
More then they know Themselves;
Who it is shall get the best at last,
They perfectly can show
At Coffe-house, when they are placed,
You Would scarce believe it true.
They know all that is Good, or Hurt,
To Dam ye, or to Save ye;
There is the College, and the Court,
The Country, Camp, and Navy;
So great a University.
I think there never was any;
In which you may a Scboolar be
For spending of a Penny.
A Merchants Prentice there shall show
You all and every thing,
What has been done, and is to do,
'Twix Holland and the King;
What Articles of Peace will be,
He can precizely show;
What will be good for Them or We,
He perfectly does know.
Here Men do talk of every Thing,
With large and liberal Lungs,
Like Women at a Gossiping,
With double tire of Tongues;
They Will give a Broadside presently,
Soon as you are in view,
With Stories that, you will wonder at,
Which they will swear are true.
The Drinking there of Chockalat,
Can make a Fool a Sophie:
It Is thought the Turkish Mabomet
Was first Insir'd with Coffe,
By which his Powers did Overflow
The Land of Palestine:
Then let us to, the Coffe-house go,
It Is Cheaper far then Wine.
You shall know there, what Fashons are;
How Perrywiggs are Curled;
And for a Penny you shall hear,
All Novells in the World.
Both Old and Young, and Great and Small,
And Rich, and Poor, you will see:
Therefore let us to the Coffe All,
Come All away with Me.
Finis.
With Alowance.
