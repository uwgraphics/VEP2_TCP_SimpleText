Cawseth our prince / to be to us to fell
This same is he / which rayseth deem and tax
This same is he / which strayneth men on rackes
This same is he / which cawseth all this war
This same is he / which al our wealth does mar
This is of com^ns / the very dedly mall
which with these charges / thus does oppres us al
who him displeseth / he beteth all to dust
This same is be / which killith whom him lust
That all the deuyls / of hell / him hence carry
That we no longer / endure his tyranny
This is the honor / and all the reverence
Gyuyn unto them / when they be from presence
But in such honor / who ever has delight
which is frawdfull / so faint and vnparfyte
I am not a ferde / to call him mad and blind
And a very fool / or else a sot of kind

Coridon Cornix my friend / thou spekest now to plain
I fere lest this gere / shall turn us unto pain
If any man be nere / be still a while and har^e

Cornix I fere not at all / now I am set on warke
Beside this Coridon / in court most part does dwell
Flateres and liars / Coriers of fauell
Iuggelers and dezers and such a schamful rabble
which for a dynner / lawd men no thing laudable
But men circumspect / which be dyscrete and wise
Does such vain / lawdes utterly despise
