A TURN-COAT of the Times.
Who does by experience profess and protest,
That of all professions, a Turn-Coat's the best.
Tune is, The King's Delight, Or, True Love is a Gift for a Queen.




AS I was walking through
Hide-Park as I used to do,
some two or three months ago
I laid me all along
Without any fear of wrong,
And listened unto a Song;
It came from a powdered thing
As fine as a Lord or a King,
he knew not that I
was got so nigh,
And thus he began to sing.
I am a Turn-coat Knave,
Although I do bear it brave,
and do not show all I have,
I can with tongue and pen
Court every sort of men,
And kill 'em as fast again.
With Zealots I can pray,
With Cavaliers I can play:
with Shopkeepers I
can cogg and lie,
And cousen as fast as they.
When first the Wars began,
And Prentices lead the Van,
'twas I that did set them on,
When they cried Bishops down,
In Country, Court and Town,
Quoth I, and have at the Crown,
The Covenant I did take,
For form and fashions sake,
but when it would not
support my plot,
'Twas like an old Almanac.
When Independency,
Had superiority
I was of the same degree;
When Keepers did command,
I then had a holy hand
In Deans and in Chapters land:
But when I began to spy,
Protectorship drew nigh,
and Keepers were
thrown over the Bar;
Old Oliver then cried I.




WHen Sectarists got the day
I used my yea, and nay;
to flatter and then betray,
In Parliament I gat,
And there a Member sat,
To tumble down Church and State,
For I was a trusty trout
In all that I went about
and there we did vow
to sit till now,
But Oliver turned us out.
We put down the house of Peers,
We killed the Cavileers,
and tippl'd the widows Tears
We sequestered men's Estates,
And made 'em pay monthly rates
To trumpeters and their mates.
Rebellion we did Print,
And altered all the Mint;
no knavery then
was done by men,
But I had a finger in it.
When Charles was put to flight
Then I was at Wor'ster fight
and got a good booty by it
At that most fatal fall
I killed and plundered all,
The weakest went to the wall,
Whilst my merry mates fell on,
To pillaging I was gone,
there is many (thought I)
will come by and by,
And why should not I be one.
We triumphed like the Turk,
We crippled the Scottish Kirk
that set us at first to work,
When Cromwell did but frown
They yielded every Town,
St. Andrew's Cross went down
But when old Nol did dye,
And Richard his Son put by,
I knew not how
to guide my plow,
where now shall I be thought I.
I must confess the Rump
Did put me in a dump,
I knew not what would be trump
When Dick had lost the day
My gaming was at a stay,
I could not tell what to play,
When Monk was upon that score
I thought I would play no more
I did not think what
he would be at,
I never was so mumpt before.
But now I am at Court,
With men of the better sort
and purchase a good report;
I have the eyes and ears,
Of many brave Noble Peers,
And slight the poor Cavileers,
Poor knaves they know not how,
To flatter, cringe and bow,
for he that is wise
and means to rise,
He must be a Turn-coat too.
Printed for William Thackeray at the Angel in Duck-lane.
