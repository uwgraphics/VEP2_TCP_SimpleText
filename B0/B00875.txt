An exhortacion to the reders by a brother of Syon.
COnsyderyng the mysery and infelicite of this our most peryllous time / how
the flode of sin has over ro^ne all ye world so yt charity and peace is
almoost extynct faith dyspersed / hope dyssolued / virtue and pity outlawed /
sanctyte annulled / presthode dystayned / relygyon decayed. In manner no
constancy in ye people / no fydelyte between neighbor and neighbor neither in
byeng nor sellyng / nor any other contract. One scantly may trust another. And
now such is ye excess of glotony / and so the people does nourysshe their
bodies: that abstynence is banysshed / and lechery exalted. Vyrgyns has lost
their dyamonde of shamefastnes / and have found the rail of boldness / which
is the noryce of wantonness. Matrymony is turned the lust of the body. would god
it were not turned in to aduoutry. where upon our most holy fader in heaven /
which was wont with his sweet rod to correct us. Now sore agreued and
dyspleased with us / makes his terryble sword of Justice over us. yea daily
with ye same does beat us with famyne / derth / and pestylence. with sodayn
death and strange sickness in in our bodies. And all this is for the sin
of our bodies. And over all these with innumerable mo myseryes. what dyuysyon
is among the princes and heedes of the church / I report me unto you. I do
fear me to the great hurt and oppressyon of the people. But very assured I am
that it is to ye great damage of grace / and loss of many a soul what kind
child of god is there in this world yt sees his fader so sore dyspleased /
and also his mother the catholycall church so sore decayed / but he would be
sorry / tremble / and quake / and seek always for remedy how he might again be
reconsyled to his fader and help to redress his mother so wounded and
dyffygured yt fro the heed unto ye foot I wot not in what degree or state of
Crystes church I may say yt there is the life / the health / and the
conversation yt should be and has been in chrystianite / our lord Jesus remedy
it / and help it. For only the work of his insuperable mercy it must needs
be. for it passes the power of man / for of man's behalf I se no remedy /
but penance and prayer. And now the hertes of ye people be so sore deiete and
converted to the asfeccyo^s of this world. and so depely enco^bred with the
study and business thereof / yt their hertes can not pray. But whiles their
mother does pray / their hearts be full of worldly cogytacio^s / and
distraccio^s of mind. They many times against their wylles (to the great loss
of the fruit of their prayer) which if it were pure nothing might resyste it
/ it would ascend to ye throne of god as scripture says. And fro thens it
would not depart while it had opteyned ye petycion. ^^cle. xxxv.
For as saint Austyn says. Impossyble it is yt the prayer of many shall not be
herd. ^^d fratres ^^heremo ^^.xliiii. et ^^sa. Ad ro^^. xv. luce.
specially wha^ it does proceed of pure and meke hertes. For ye gospel of
Christ does show us ye importune prayer with co^tynuall perseuerau^ce / albeit
ye thing seem impossyble yt we ask of god ^^le.xxxv.
/ it will at ye last in line the ear of ye mercy of god and opteyne comfort
/ as he showed in the parable of.iij. loves. And not withstandyng that we be
not his friends: but wretches and sinners: and therefore by reason of our sin
he sees in us no cause to have pity on us. yet contynuall prayer will
vaynquysshe him / and inclyne his mercy and charity to releue our necessytees
satysfy: and our requests. Luce. xviii
As he showed himself in the symilytude of the wydowe and the unright wise
judge / which for the wydowes importune and contynuall cry and clamor was
compelled and feign to give sentence with her. ps. xc clam^uit adme. ^^
So god will do / for so he promised unto his people. with what soever sin /
temptacyon / sickness / loss of goods / or other aduersyte of the world we
be vexed / call and pray perseuerauntly and we shall have conforte. luce. xviii.
But he byddeth us to pray and cease not. But alas for sorrow yt prayer is in
manner gone. I mean the contynually affection / mind / and desire to god and
godly things / with habundaunce of deeds of pity and alms / according to their
abylite. For who has these he co^tynually does pray as this treatise following
more largely does declare. And shows also what is prayer and how we should
order our prayer. and our self in the time of prayer. And how we should make
our petycyon / with many other great co^modytees and benefytes which comes by
prayer. And specially remedies against wandryng minds and vain cogytacyons in
time of prayer / which premysses consyderyng / and seeing how charity of ye
people is now very cold. eccle. xxix.
And alms which hyd in the bosom of ye poor was wont to pray instauntly / but
now has ceased / for little is given in yt respect as it has been. Therefore
I was very glad yt this treatise fortuned to come to my hands / sith I found
it both good / devout / fruytfull / and catholycall / thynkyng how many hertes
of the people should be much conforted therein / did cause it to be imprynted.
And so much more rather yt the drawer and auctour of it / is one of the devout
fathers of ye Cartherhous of Shene. whose virtue and learning is well approved.
wherefore devout reder I counsel the to bye this sweet treatise / and exercise
thy self ordering thy self there after. And I doubt not but thou shall do
much honor to god / suffrage to all christian people / and to thy self much
profit and edyfyeng. which almighty god grant to all the reders thereof.

AMEN.

O man unkind
Bear in thy mind
My pains smerte
And you shall find
Me true and kind
Lo here my heart.
The prologue of the treatise following.
WIth ye grace of god I intend in this treatise following to show how a man
ought to order himself in time of prayer / and what should be ye fynall intent
thereof / and for what things I think it most expedient for to pray. But
first of all I shall declare what is prayer after ye dyffinycion of saint
Augustyn / and this in the first chapter. In the second chapter that a man
should often times use prayer. In the third chapter of the prouffite yt comes
thereby In the.iiij. chapter of.iij. things necessary to be co^sydered tofore
the beginning of prayer. After this I shall speak of two manner of prayers /
that is to say / of mental prayer / and vocal prayer. The which saint
Bonaue^ture deuydeth in to two parts / that is in to pure vocal prayer / and
myxte vocal prayer. which is one and which is the other / it shall be declared
in their places. But my special intent and meaning is most of the myxte
prayer. For that (as I suppose) is most necessary for to be used of such
persons for whom I write this treatise. But peradventure some men will
marvel why I did not write this matter in latin style (for then it might have
been understand of many persons: as well of alyens as of this land) but in
english / the which but few / that is to say only english men / or such
as have been co^uersaunt in england do understand. The cause is this. I was
desire both of learned and of unlearned to write this treatise. Not for the
learned (for they understand scripture / and know this matter better tha^ I)
but for the unlearned that lack knowledge of holy scripture / to instruct them
in the order of prayer. That is to say / to show them for whom / or what
things it is most expedyent to pray / and what should moeue them to pray
devoutly / and give them occasyon to perceuer therein / with such other as
shall be contained in the said treatise following. Now I have made answer to
such points as may be objected of some quycke wytted persons. I will beseech
the devout chrystyans for whom I have taken this labor / and written this
matter at their desire to the honor of god / and to the profit of their
souls and mine / to look upon it substancyally. And not be contented with
redynge it ones over / but keep it with the^ contynually / vsyng often to read it
over / unto such time as they be very perfyte therein / for I trust the after
that they read it the better they shall like it. And like as a Pomaunder when
it is chausted and made warm with contynuaunce in a man's hand gives a
fragrant and sweet smell / so I trust this Pomaunder of prayer (for so I will
this treatise be named) if it be often times looked on and read with good
purpose to practyse such things as shall be contained therein / will give a
fragraunt smell of spyrytuall conuersacyon and living to the devout reders of
it. The which if it so do / I pray the^ to give laud and praysynge to god
therefore. And contrary wise where any thing is amysse ascrybe it (I pray the^)
to my insuffycyency and ignorance / which lack both learning and eloquence.
Finally I beseech all them specially that shall profyce by this poor treatise
/ to pray for me a wretch / which has bestowed this labor to the honor of
god and their edyfyeng / that I may work in mine own life these instruccyons
that I have gathered and written for them And I shall pray for them by the
grace of god / who ever be with them.

Emanuel. The preface.
OF late time I have been instauntly desired of certain spyrytuall fre^des to
write some treatise that might be inductyue and also demonstratyue (to such
devout persons as lack lernyng and knowledge of holy scripture) how and under
what manner they might order them self in prayer. To the performacyon of this
charytable desire and request I know my self unworthy and unable / both for
lack of speculacyon and practyse thereof. Not withstanding I will desire my
solycytares in this matter to call with me to our savior Jesus Christ / saying
as one of this dyscyples did. Domine doce nos orare. Luce. xi.
That is to say Lord or master teache us to pray. This done I shall study with
dylygence / some thing to satysfye their desire / as it shall please our
foresaid master Jesus to give me grace.

The dyffynycyon of prayer. Ca. i.
^^.cc. xxxix. ^^p^^e.
FIrst I think it very expedient to show you ye dyffynicion of prayer that ye
may ye better know what it is. Saint Austyn says. Quid autem estoratio: nisi
ascentio ai^e deterrestribus ad celestia: inquisitio supernorum: inuisibilium
desiderium? As who should say. Prayer is nothing else but an ascencyon of the
soul from erthly things to heavenly things that be above / and a desire of
things inuysyble. we may take this dyffynycion that when we pray we should not
wylfully suffer the affeccion of our minds to rest on worldly creatures / but
we should have our desires eleuate unto god omnipotent in heaven. And this
appears well in the beginning of ye prayer the which Christ did teache to his
dysciples: where as we say. Pater noster qui es i^ celis: sanctificetur nomen
tuum. ^^^^thei. vi.^
O our fader the which art in heaven / santyfied be thy name. This word. In
celis (as says the gloss ordynary) is put there because yt we should in time
of prayer eleuat our minds unto ye spiritual heuyns / where as is ye fader
omnipotent most excellent in his glory. we should so order our self in prayer
that we might truly say with the apostle saint Poule. ^^^d philip. ^^x.
Nostra autem co^uersatio in celis est.

That we should often times use prayer. Ca. ij.
IN many and diverse places of holy scripture we be exhorted and provoked to
frequentacyon of prayer. It is written. Ad col. iii.
Orationibus insta^te vigila^tes in eis in gratiaru^ action. Use you to pray
instau^tly / not slepyngly / nor slouthfully / but quykly and devoutly gyuyng
thanks and praysynges to god. It is also written. Subditus esto dn^o: et ora
eum. Psalm. xxxv^
Subdue thyselfe man to thy lord god / and make thy prayers to him. Also. Non
impediaris orare semper. Eccle xvii^
Let nothing be impedyment to the / but that thou may be ever in prayer.
Also our savior Christ in the gospel of Luke. Oportet semper orare et no^
deficere. Luce. xviii
ye should ever be prayeng and never cease. And ye apostle saint Poule. Sine
intercessione orate. 1. Ad thess^ v.
That is to say Pray you and cease not. And also ad Timotheum. Volo ergo viros
orare in omni loco. I will that men be prayeng in every place. But because these
words sounds to be very streyte / if we take the lytterall sense of them.
For it is very hard / and almost impossible for any man ever to continue in
actual prayer. A certain holy doctor expoundyng says. Beda suplu came ca.
xvii.
Nu^quam de sinit orare nisi qui desinit bn^facere. As long as a man is doing
any good deeds: so long he is prayeng. And except he cease from doing good
deeds: he cease not to pray. This exposycion makes the words beforesayd
easy / and comforts the reders or herers of this. yet not withstandyng I will
exhort every devout chyrstyan to give the^self to vocal prayer as nygh as they
may co^uenyently and expedyently. For doubtless thereof will come great profit
and manyfolde fruytes / of the which by the grace of god part I shall bryefly
and shortly touch

Of the profit yt comes by prayer. Ca. iii.
^^^omeli^. ^^lxxviii.
THe holy doctor saint John^ Chrysostom says. Magnu^vere bonu^ charissimi
or^o. etc To bring you in much latin it is great labor to me / and but little
profit or none to ye reders. For my purpose is specially to write to such
persons as be unlearned / and not to the^ yt be learned. wherefore here after I
shall leave ye latin and speak ye sense thereof in english / trustyng yt it
shall be more co^pendyous to me / and more acceptable to the^ for whom I write.
This doctor Chrisostom says. Prayer is a thing of great virtue and goodness.
For if ye take great profit by co^munycacion with a man yt is approbate and
singular in vtues. How much more (says he) shall ye person have yt in his
prayer speaks to god / the which is the lord and gyuer of all virtues? ^^e.
xxx. de ^^. e.
Saint Augustyn says yt prayer does call the grace of ye holy ghost to a
ma^nis soul / it puts away all hardness of hertt yt makes fasting and
abstyne^ce to be dulcet and delectable to a man's soul. And like as a man can
not make a perfyte refeccyo^ or meal without drink / so fasting without prayer
can not perfytely nourysshe ye soul. Prayer causes a person yt is in deedly
syn^e / and in ye state of da^pnacion to rise fro his syn^e / and to be made ye
child of salvation. Prayer (as says Ludolphe ye carthusian in a certain
sermon) is a virtue inestymable / and of suffycyent efficacy to i^petrate and
get all thing yt is good / and to repel and wtstande all thing that is not
good. By prayer we obtain pacyence in all sekenesses / dyseases / and
aduersytees. By prayer we may subdue all evil affeccyo^s. By prayer we may
perceive the subtyltees and dysceytes of our goostly enmyes / and be able to
resyst and avoid them. By prayer we may gladly suffer and strongly bear without
tedyousnes all penyte^cyall labors and afflyccyo^s. By prayer we may be able
to profit in the sweet excercyses of spyrytuall living. By prayer we may
refreyne ye bestyall and carnal appetytes of our bodies. By prayer we may
eschew ye delectacyon of vain thoughts. By prayer we may stablysshe our
hertes in constant purpose and spu^all strength to ye pleasure of god. Prayer
is much profitable at every necessyte / for by it we may remove and expel fro
us al wicked spyrytes / and call for our help and consolacyon ye glorious
angels of heaven. For as saint Bid says Like as a thief does fle away wha^
he hereth ye clamor or noise of his resystenes: so does our goostly enmye ye
devil wha^ he hereth ye clamor of prayer. And like as their neybours come at
their calling to help them yt be in danger of thieves / so do ye good angels
of god come to help us against our enmyes when we call to the^ by prayer. The
manyfolde affliccio^s of king Pharao by ye prayer of Moses were ever wtdrawen
and taken away. wha^ ye children of Israel murmured against god in desert
so^tymes he punisshed the^ with fire / sometime with brennyng serpe^tes / and
sometime by other means / of ye which it were to long to speak now / but ever
when Moses prayed for the^ our lord wtdrewe his sword of ve^geau^ce fro
the^. By prayer king Dauyd was delivered fro ye persecucio^s of Saul and
Absolo^. By prayer Helyas obtened of god yt it did not rain by ye space
of.iij. years and.vi. months / and than he prayed again for to have rayn /
and it pleased god to send sufficyent thereof for ye produccio^ of fruytes and
other necessaries By prayer Helyzeus did reyse fro death to life ye child of
the Sunamyte with whom he had his hospitalyte. It would ask a long space to
speak of all the miracles and other things that the prophets and other good
men of the old law / and ye apostles with other true chrystyans of ye new
law has optened of god by the virtue of prayer. wherefore I will let them
pass / prayeng you my spyrytuall friends to be contented with these few / the
which I have now shortly touched. And for a breue conclusyon of this matter I
shall bring one auctoryte of the gospel yt does suffycye^tly express what
profit come^th by prayer / though there were no mo in all holy scripture but
only it. Our master Christ in the gospel of Mark says. Quecu^que orantes
petitis: Capitulo. xi
credit qr accipietis: et euenient vobis. That is to say. what soever ye right
wysly desire of me by prayer / believe that ye shall have it and ye shall have it
after / your desire / or else much better / and more for your profit.
Therefore seeing that prayer is of so great dygnyte / and so acceptable to god
let us not forgete to pray / but let us occupy our selfs therein / as much as
we may conuenyently. But peradventure some men of the world will say. Prayer
is ordained to co^templatyf and relygious persons: for they have nothing else
to be occupied with / wherefore let them pray. But we that be men of ye world
have other business to do / and therefore we may not be ever rennyng to ye
church to make our prayers. It shall be suffycye^t for us to pray on the holy
days. I fear me lest there be many of this faculte now of days / more is ye
pity. And I think yt the cause thereof is blyndnesse of heart engendered by
custom of syn^e. From ye which to be delivered our mother holy church does
pray saying. A cecitate cordys libera nos domine. I know not what it should
avail to exhort such persons to prayer / except they would first purge their
souls from this blyndnesse by contricion / co^fessyon / and satysfaccion / yet
notwtstandyng if they would fall to prayer / by the virtue thereof / they might
obtain grace to rise the more quyckely from their sinful living. But my
purpose as now is to write specially to such devout persons / as I trust will
not to their knowledge rest in deedly syn^e / for all the temporal lucres of
this world. And I trust of that dysposicyon there be right many. whose number
I beseech our lord to multyply and increase. These devout souls I will
counsel often times to use prayer / and not to make such excuses as the other
persons beforesaid do. For as says saint John^ Chrysostom in his foresaid
homyly it is no suffycient excuse to say they may not be ever at the church to
pray For a man that is well dysposed may pray in any place where soever he is.
For it is neither the place nor the time yt is impedyment to prayer. If a man
neither lift up his hands toward the heuens / nor knele on his knees / nor
make tunsyon on his breast / yet shall he make a parfyte prayer / if he render
to god only a fervent and devout mind. That man that is come of noble blood
and ryall progeny may be at lyberte to frequentate ye church and other secret
places at his pleasure for his devotion. And therefore may he the more quyetly
give hymsel e to vocal prayer. And not only wha^ he is secret / but also
wha^ he is in company he may use to pray / though his prayers be than the
shorter. As (for an example) when he sytteth at dinner / or souper / or when he
is so^tymes at other honest recreacio^s: he may lift up his heart unto god
saying in his mind / though he speak nothing with his mouth. Jesus have mercy
upon me / and forgive me all my sins. Jesus give me grace to be thy true and
faithful servant. Jesus make me to love the with all my heart / and all my
soul. with such other as it shall please god to put in his mind / sometimes
sayng one / and somtymes another. And if it please him to speak with his mouth
he may so^tymes say. Aue benign Jesus. And somtymes. Aue maria. with such other
short prayers as shall come to his remembrance / the which saint Augustyn
calls Or^ones iaculatories / yt is to say / prayers iaculatory: or ready at
ye hand. And they be very profitable and expedyent to obtain grace. Thus may
the man of worship occupy himself in prayer. Other men yt be of inferyous
degrees whyther they be merchants / yomen / or crafts men or of what
co^dycyon soever they be they can not be excused / but they may use much
prayer if they will. For if they be ryding or going in journey they may have
space enough thereto / if they be at home at their occupacyo^s or sellyng of
their ware / yet may they use such short prayers as I have beforesaid in their
shoppes or other places where they be. For god regards more ye heart and mind
of him ye prays tha^ he does ye place where he prays. The prophet Hieremy
being in ye foul prison / and standing in clay and dyrt / made his prayers to
god. Danyell in ye lake of lions did also pray to god. Jonas being in ye belly
of a great fysshe did not forgete to pray. The thief hangyng on the cross at
the right hand of Christ made his prayer in few words. Job sytting on ye
do^ghyl did offer up his prayers to god. And all they by the merits of their
prayers was herd of god / and they obtained their desires to their great
co^solacyon and confort. Here may ye se yt god does accept the douout prayer
of man in what place soever it is said. Therefore my intyerly beloved friends:
let us exercise our selfs in prayer as much as we may / never deferryng it
for the time nor for the place. For every time / and every place is apt and
conuenyent for prayer. For if we give our self thus to prayer / I trust in the
goodness of god we shall taste of the wholesome and sweet fruytes yt comes
thereof / of the which part I have shortly touched here before.

Of.iij. things necessary to be considered before the beginning of prayer. Ca.
iiij.
AFter the mind of the mellyfluous doctor saint Bernarde in his book of
sentences: it is necessary for every person to consider three things tofore
the beginning of their prayer. First what thing they intend to ask in
prayer. Secondaryly of whom they ask. Thyrdly themself that do ask. As to
ye first party I say / it is necessary to consider before their prayer / what
thing they intend to ask in prayer / leest peradventure they should ask
that thing that should be contrary unto charity / as the death of their enemies
/ damage of their neighbors / or other such. He that so prayed deserves not
for to be herd of god. Ca. ^^^.
For he in the gospel of saint Luke / the syxt chapter does exhort us for to
love our evil wyllers or enmyes / and to be benefycyall to them yt do hate us
/ and to pray for them that wrongfully do persecute us. But if we pray for the
remyssyon of our sins / for ye grace of ye holy ghost / for virtue / for
spiritual wysdom for faith / for truth / for justice / for mekenes / for
pacyence / and for such other / than almighty god of his infynyte goodness
will quykly here us / and grant our desire. For of them yt in prayer asks
such things almighty god speaks by his prophet Esaias saying. Ca. lxv.
wha^ they be spekyng I shall here them / and tofore the and begin to cry I
shall gracyously here the^. Secondaryly we must consider of whom we ask any
thing by prayer for ye salvation of our souls. For we ought to have before our
eyes as the only graunter and gyuer of our peticion. That is to say god
omnypote^t. And in him we must consider.ij. things / his infenite goodness /
and his superexcellent magesty. His goodness by the which he will freely
grant us our desire. And this shall cause us to have a great co^fydence and
trust in him. His magesty by the which he may grant / and give what soever it
shall please him. And this shall cause us to give honor and reverence to him /
as it besemeth the creature to give to him that did create and make him.
Thyrdly we must consider our selfs who and what we be that do ask any thing
of god by prayer / yt is to say / yt we be wretches of ye world and grievous
sinners / deseruyng to obtene nothing that we pray for / as of our own
merytes: but only by the great mercy and goodness of god. And this will cause
us to humylyate and meke our selfs in the sight of god / and than we may be
sure that he will not despise our prayers. Ps. C.i.
For the prophet says. Our lord has looked on meke men: and he has not
dispysed their prayer.

How there is two manner of prayers: of ye which one is called vocal and the
other mental. Ca v.
WE read by a holy doctor of.ij. manner of prayers: of the which one is called
vocal prayer / and the other is called me^tall prayer. Vocal prayer is yt /
the which is spoken by mouyng of the tongue and of the lyppes: and by
pronouncyng of ye sou^de. Of this prayer speaks the prophet in ye.iij. psalm
/ saying. Voce mea ad dn^m clamaui: et exaudiuit mede mo^te scto^ suo. I cried
to our lord with my voice / and he herd me from his holy hill. And also in
ye.xvij. psalm. In tribulatione mea inuocaui dn^m: et ad deu^ meum clamaui. Et
exaudiuit de templo scto^ suo vocem meam. etc In my trybulacion I inwardly
called our lord / and I cried to my god / and it pleased him from his holy
temple to here my voice. After the mind of saint Bonauenture in his third
questyon upon the.xiiij. dystinction / in the.iiij. book of ye master of ye
sentences: vocal prayer may be divided in to.ij. parts / yt is to say in to
pure vocal prayer / and in to myxte vocal prayer. Pure vocal prayer is when
a man speaks the words with his mouth without any affection or deuocio^ of ye
mind perteynyng thereto. And this is but of small merit and little effect / if
there be no intencyon actual nor virtuall going tofore / but if it have an
intencion going tofore / yt is to say if a man at ye beginning of his prayer
lift up his mind to god with good purpose to pray devoutly / than is this prayer
merytoryous / though his mind afterward by fraylte be not much thereon / it
is suffycye^t to excuse a man of his duty.

Myxte vocal prayer is that the / which is spoken with ye mouth / and
proceeds fro the heart with ardaunt devotion and fervent affection of the mind.
This manner of prayer is very good and profitable / and gretely accepted in the
sight of almighty god. And unto such persons ye perceive their devotion to
increase by spekyng of ye sweet words in prayer / this myxte prayer is comynly
ye best / and this I think does fortune most often in good devout people of
ye world (for whom I specially write this treatise) the which have a good
mind to serve god. But yet they have not experyence of the delectable
spiritual life / nor did never taste the sweet delicious wynes of the life
co^templatyfe / which god has reserueth unto such persons yt be as it were
sequestrate from the world / and the affeccyons thereof / and through the
mortyfycacyon of sensualyte be made by the grace of god much spyrytuall. The
mental prayer (of the which here after I intend to speak / as it shall please
my master Jesus for to give me grace) I think is ye best / if it me used
sobrely and dyscretely. For else it is so laborous and so vyolent / yt within
short space it will bring a man unto such debilitacion and weykenesse of
brain yt it will cast him in great danger of sickness / or some other great
inconuenyence.

Mental prayer is that the which is offered to almighty god with perfyte
fervor of spyryte and devotion of the mind / without any sound of words
spoken by the mouth This prayer is of great effect and profitable if it be
used dyscretely as I said before. In some case ye myxte vocal prayer is better
to some persons than is this. But if we shall speak sympliciter and without
any such respect I think this mental prayer is the best. For vocal prayer
both pure and myxte may be spoken and said when ye mind is occupied with vain
cogytacyons of things said or done in ye world / the which perteyneth
nothing to their prayer. But this mental prayer is of so noble and so pure
nature / that it will not at that time admyt any other thought that should be
impediment or lettynge to it. For when a man prays mentally / his mind is
only thereupon / or upon due cyrcu^stau^ces perteynyng thereto. And if any other
thought by chance do occupye his mind / for that time he cease to pray
mentally. This prayer is of great excellency ad dignite / and is the very true
and faithfully ambassador betwyxt god and man's soul. For there can none
aduersyte let him but he will go ye right way to ye celestyall palace / where
as the king of all kings: and lord of all lords does contynually tarry /
and there effectuously with due honor and reverence show the causes of his
coming. yea / and this heavenly messager orders himself so wisely and so
amyably that the most high and almyghtyest king and emperor will not lightly
deny him any manner of thing that he desires. But what soever he charitably
asks / this most heavenly king gracyously grants. On this manner prayed
Anna the wife of Helcana / as it is expressly manifest by ye bible in ye first
book of ye kings. when Hely the priest did behold her face largely perfused
with tears of devotion. She prayed to god because she had been al her life
without any fruit procreate by the sede of man / yt it would please his mercy
and goodness to grant her a sone yt might be his true servant. As she prayed
in this manner Hely seeing her lips move and heryng no voice thought yt she had been inebryate with drinking to much wine. It may well be that she was dronken /
but not of this materyall wine made of grapes by the craft of man / but she was
dronken with spyrytuall wine of devotion the which came fro the wyneceller of
heaven. whereof the holy ghost / ye third person in trynite is the tauerner /
or vyntener. Of how blyssed is he / or she that may be inebryate with this
wine? I beseech you all my spyrituall fre^des to pray for me a wretch / that I
may have grace so to order my self yt I may deserve some thing to cast of
this wine / to the laud and praise of him that is both wine and vyntener. I
mean of this devout and sweet me^tall prayer / of the which to speak a little
more I hold it expedyent. wherefore I will exhort such persons that by grace
can and may practyse themself therein to use it with dyscrecyon. And if they
perceive them self strong of nature and may well away therewith / to use it often
/ but not long at ones. if they perceive themself weyke or feeble in brain /
it is good for them to use it but little. It is a pretty craft to pray mentally.
And there be (as I suppose) but few that be co^nyng therein. This art
perteneth most specially to co^templatyf persons: and other devout seculer
persons yt have suffycie^t knowledge of scripture and spyrituall things. To
other unlearned persons it is most profitable to use the prayer of mouth /
gyuyng thereto ye devotion of mind as much as they may. And this for a
co^clusyon (as says saint Thomas) it is expedyent for every person to
exercise and use yt manner of prayer / whither it be mental or vocal / in the
which they find most sweetness and increase of devotion.

Of.ij. things necessaryly required to prayer. Ca. vi.
IF that the prayer of man shall be pleasant and acceptable in the sight of
god / it must have.ii. propryetes: yt is to say / devotion and continuance.
First I say our prayers must be offered to god with devotion / and with inwardly
affeccyo^ of heart and mind / or else it is no marvel though we be not herd
of him to whom we pray. For if a man should make his supplycacion to a great
prince of this world in any necessary cause / either for himself or for his
friend / and did not speak effectuously nor hertely in the said cause / but
slouthfully and as it were slepyngly pronunce his words / so that the prince
might well and euydently perceive that his heart did nothing agree with his
words: it is to be supposed yt he would deny his peticion or supplicacio^. So
likewise when the excellent prince of heaven the which knows the heart and
thought of every person / does perceive that in the time of prayer our hertes
be not consonaunt with our words: it is no marvel though he regard not our
peticio^s or prayers. wherefore it is very expedyent if our prayers shall be
accepted of god / yt we e^deuer our selfs to pray with fervor and devotion. Of
certain things that shall give us occasyon to devotion in time of prayer I
shall show you hereafter by the grace of Jesus. But first I intend some thing
to speak of the contynuaunce that we should have in prayer.

Our savior Christ in the gospel of Mathe. does provoke us nt only to prayer
saying Petite et accipietis: querite et inuenietis: pulsate et aperietur vobis.
That is to say. Ask and ye shall have / seche and ye shall find / knock and
I shall open to you. In these words we may have a great confidence and trust
to obtain whatsoever we right wysly desire by prayer. For he yt bydded us ask
will not deny. If he would have denied / he would not have bydden us ask. And
therefore says saint Augustyn (Sermon equite de verbis dn^i in eua^geliu^ sedin
Matheu^). He that counceyleth thus to ask / will he deny? as who would say /
no. But peradventure somtymes he will not grant our petycyons by and by / but
dyfferre unto another time. And yt for diverse causes? ye which if I should
now recyte / they would ask a long time / therefore I will let them pass
all / except one yt is most for my purpose. After the opynion of diverse
doctors so^tymes almighty god deferreth to grant ye petycyo^s of his
supplycauntes and servants: because he would yt they should co^tynue and
persevere in prayer. For perseueraunce in prayer and in every good deed is
worthy to to have a great reward / and therefore it is wryte^. Qui
perseuerauerit vsque in finem hic saluus erit. ^athe.x.
who that in goodness does persevere unto the end / he shall be saved. And
also of ye perseueraunce in prayer it is written. Eccliast. Melior est finis
orationis: quam principisi. Ca. iii.
The end of prayer is better than the beginning. wherefore our master Christ
says. luce. xviii.
Oportet semper orare et non deficere / ye should persevere in prayer and not
fail them. Thus does our savior Jesus spekyng in holy scripture / exhort us
to the co^tynuau^ce and perseueraunce in prayer. And he does not only council
us by his sweet and confortable words: but also he provoke us thereto by
famylyare examples Of the which one we read in the.xviij. chapter of ye
eua^gelyst Luke. where he says. Iudex quida^ erat in quida^ ciuitate. etc.
There was a judge in a certain cite the which did not fear god nor man /
unto whom came a certain wydow of the same cite / desyryng him that she might
have right of her adversary. He deferred and would not regard her words of a
long season. But yet at the last because of her importunyte he remembered
himself and said. Though it be so that I dread neither god nor man / yet for
her perseueraunt instaunce and desire I will se that her adversary shall do her
no wrong / leest peradventure at the last through her importunyte she will be
unto me much tedyouse. This aforesaid parabole spoke our savior Jesus Christ
for to provoke us unto the co^tynuance of prayer. And in like wise as the judge
did dyfferre by a long space / and yet at the last did condescende unto the
desire of ye wydowe because of her contynuyng instaunce. So will the most
glorious sader of heaven sometime dyfferre for to grant such things as we do
desire of him by prayer. But if that we will persevere always / and call to him
contynually / at the last he will grant our petycyo^s because of our
importunite. Also of this matter we have another parabole in the gospel of
Luke. ^cc. xi.
where our savior Christ says. Quis vestru^ habebit amicu^. etc. which of you
has a friend and gooth to him at mydnyght sayng to him. My friend I pray you
lend me.iij. loves of bread / For I have a stranger come^ to me / and I have
no bread to set on ye table before him. And he being wtin says answeryng on
this manner. I pray you disease me not / for my doors be shet / and I and my
servants be all in bed. I can not now rise and lend them you. yet he is not
contented with this answer / but taryeth still contynually knockyng and
calling / and will not return to his house till he speed of his purpose. I tell
you truth (says our master Christ) if he will not arise because he is his
friend / yet for his improbite or his i^portunyte / at the last he will arise
and lend him as much bread as is necessary. Se here my gostly fre^des how
our loving lord and master Jesus christ shows to us this parabole to provoke
us to the perceuerau^ce of prayer / whose counsel and prouocacyon if we follow
/ undoubtedly as this man caused his friend to rise at mydnyght and lend him
bread. So will almighty god (though he defer for a time) give us al thing
necessary / if we call to him with co^tynuau^ce and perfourmaunce of prayer.

Of certain things that will give a man occasyon to pray devoutly. Ca. vii.
I Promise here tofore yt I would show you ol such things yt will give you
occasyon to devotion in time of prayer / wherefore by the gace of Jesus now I
shall do my dylyge^ce to perform that promysse It is a special help to
devotion before your prayers to make a due preparacyon. Therefore it is written.
Ante or^onem prepara ai^am tuam. Before thy prayer prepare thy mind / or thy
soul thereto. Ecclesi. xviii. ca.
But peradventure some men be ignorant / and know not how to prepare them /
therefore I shall show them after my simple reason the manner thereof. First when
ye intend to pray / tofore the beginning of your prayer: call to mind part
of the many and great benefytes with the which god of his goodness has
suffycyently in dued you. As the benefytes of your creacyon / how he created
and made your soul to his own symylitude or likeness. Of your rede^pcyon /
how it pleased the second person in trynite to come fro the glory in heaven
unto this vale of mysery / and here to suffer great penury and pains all the
time of his life / and at ye last most bitter passion and death on the cross
/ for ye redemption of you and all mankind. Of your preseruacyon / how that
god of his singular gracyousnesse has preserved you from the first day of your
natyuite to this present time / gyuyng you meat and drink and clothes and all
other things necessary and expedient for you to have. And besides these many
times he has delivered you from the ieopardy of corporal death. where as if ye
had been deed at yt time / perchance your soul should have been in great
danger of dampnacion / by the reason of deedly sin / in the which
peradventure at such time ye were culpable. Of your promised gloryficacion /
how god of his charitable benignite has predestynate you to be perpetual
inheredytare of ye kingdom of heaven / where as ye shall have the fruycyon and
clear sight of his deyte / the which shall be more Joy to you than my pen can
write / heart can think / or mouth can speak. Remembrynge these with such
other / as it shall please god at that time to put in your mind / give lauds
and thanks to him / not only for them: but also generally for all his other
benyfytes the which be innumerable. when ye have thus done / remember how
unthankful and how unkind you have been to him / that did never before give
him due thanks for all such his great benyfytes / but most unkindly
forgetyng them have offended his magesty by the reason of innumerable syn^e /
the which ye have committed by all ye times of your life / Beseech his grace
tha^ of mercy and forgyuenes knowlegyng your self to be a wretched sinner /
and of so great fraylte that ye be neither able of your self to pray devoutly
/ nor to do any other good deed acceptable to him. Desire him mekely and
louyngly yt he will vouchesaufe to dyrect your prayer / so that it may be
acceptable to him / and profitable to your self and all other things
necessary to be prayed for / sayng with the prophet dauyd. ^sal. cxi.
Dirigantur domine or^o mea: sicut incensum in conspectu tuo. Good lord I
beseech the that my prayer may be dyrected and ascended in the sight of the /
like to the sweet odor of encense. Thus ordryng your self as I have now said
/ I trust in ye mercy of god that ye shall make a conuenyent preparacyon going
before your prayer. And this take ye for ye first thing that shall give you
occasyon of deuocio^ The second thing yt shall cause you deuoutely to pray is
to remember first what need and necessyte ye have of prayer as concerning your
own person. Seco^dayly what need generally all the world has. And thyrdly
what need ye souls have yt be in the pains of purgatory.

First I say it shall moeue you to pray devoutly if ye intyerly will consider
what need you have of prayer / as concerning your self. For if ye examyn your
conscience depely / consyderyng dyscretely how your fraylte is much i^clyned
to pride / to wrath / to envy to slouthe / to glotony / to auaryce / to
lechery / and to the spyces and branches of them. And on the contrary part
how slow ye be to vysyte ye syke persons / to comfort the^ that be desolate
and lack consolacion / to give alms to ye poor people. etc. And how tedyous
it is for you to here ye word of god priched / to here your mass and other
dyuine service. And how so^pnolent and slep^ ye be thera^ / with ^^^ches there ^^y
^^s: I doubt not but ye shall well perceive yt you had great need of prayer for
your own person / and that shall moeue you to pray devoutly Secondaryly I
think that it will cause you to pray devoutly if ye consider what need all the
world has of prayer. For as says saint Johan the apostle in his (...)
epistle. C^. ^. ^
Mundus totus in maligno positus est. That is to say. all the world it set on
unhappiness and myschefe. Not so to be understood yt every person in the
world is so ill dysposed. But that many: and it is to be feared lest the most
part be much set to follow ye concupyscence of vice and sin. we know by
daily experience yt in the people of the world ^tue does gretely decay / and
vice does daily encreas and multyply. who is now living that ever saw or
herd of me new inuencyons of pride and vanytees than is in these days? who
herd ever of moo dysceytes and frauds among kynsfolkes and neybours? was the
sin of the flesh ever more used / sithe ye time yt Sodom and Gomorre were
dystroyed than it is now? was there ever greter swering and blasphemy than is
now? It is taken but for a tryfle to swear by ye precious wounds and body of
our savior Jesus Christ / and by the mass / and by the glorious sacrament of ye
auter. Alas for pity / it would ask to long space if I should reherce
syngulerly by himself every great notable vice yt is comynly and daily used in
the world. But you my spyrytuall friends yt be more conuersaunt in the face of
the world than I am / may se and perceive much more abusion / that I cease
to speak of now because I will not tarry so long in this matter. But if I shall
speak any thing concerning ye mynistres of crystes church yt should be adorned
with grace and virtues to the example of other / I fear me yt among part of
them is also much abusion. who herd ever of more symony? who herd ever of
more sellyng of benefices under color of pensio^s. who herd ever of more
auaryce regnyng among seculer prestes than is in these days? To speak of them
yt be reguler / who saw ever relygio^ more remyshly kept? who saw ever so
many apostates that have forsaken their relygyo^ and be now insecular habit?
And for a co^clusyon to speak generally of persons of every faculte. who herd
ever of more heresy open and suspected than is in these days? Take heed
dyligent reder and consider / whither ye words of saint John^ before rehearsed
/ may now be veryfyed or not / where he says. Mundus totus in maligno positus
est. The world is all set on sin. I think there is no man that profoundly
and effectuously does consider this general mysery yt is used thrughe the
most part of all the world / but it shall give him occasyo^ to pray devoutly
for amendment thereof. And this for the second part.

Thyrdely to consider how great need the souls yt be in the pains of
purgatory have of prayer / will also submynyster plenteous and habou^daunt matter
of deuocyo^. For there they be without co^solacyon or comfort / in great
derkenesse and mysery / suffryng pains ineffable and contynually calling and
cryenge for mercy / and for to be releued with devout prayers: and other
charytable deeds of good crystie^s yet living in this world. Oh what heart is
so hard yt will not be mollefyed with co^passyon upon those poor souls that
there be in pains intolerable. It passes the capacyte of all men lyui^g to
express ye gretenes of the pains with ye which they be grievously tormented.
After the mind of some doctors their pains be egall in comparyson to the
pains of hell. Except that ye pains of hell be perpetual / and the pains of
purgatory temporal. There they be somtymes in extreme coldness / and sometime
in inextynguyble hotenesse. That hotenesse after ye opynyo^ of some catholycall
men / as far excedeth ye hotenesse of this elementary and materyall fire / as
the hotenesse of this fire passes the hotenesse of the fyguratyf fire painted
on a wall. if any such comparyson may be made I will speak no more of this
matter / for I can not express / neither in general nor in specyal what
horrible pains ye souls yt be there suffer / and shall do unto such time as
they have made condign satysfaccyo^ for their trespaces committed / and not
suffyciently punysshed in this life. Except they be released by the devout
prayers (as I said before) and by other good dedys of charitable cristya^s
living yet in this world. wherefore every devout person before the beginning
of his prayer call to mind ye ineffable pains yt these souls do suffer /
thynki^g if he were therewith the^ how glad he would be to be released by ye
merytes of suffrages and prayers. This doing I suppose yt there is no man so
cold nor so dull / but he would styre him to the warmnes and fervor of
devotion.

Now have I showed you after my poor manner of certain means: the which well
consyderyng before ye beginning of prayer will excytate and moeue your hertes
to ye fervent swetnes of devotion. yet I intend by the help of Jesus breuely
to superadde and put one thing more / and so to make an end of this matter.
But peradventure some men will think yt I am superfluous in this point. for it
would be very long and tedyous to remember so many things ever tofore ye
beginning of prayer. As to this obieccion I make this answer. If a man should
consider every thing at ye large as it is written it would ask a long space.
But ye effect of the^ with a quycke memory may be so shortly co^prehe^ded that
they shall not be tedyous / nor any thing grievous to any such whom it shall
please to put them in practyse. But yet for more compendyousnesse I will that
all be not remembered at one time / and but sometime one / and sometime another /
and so I think they will be tedyous to no man.

Another mean that will give you occasyo^ for to pray devoutly / is tofore che
beginning to think yt either tofore your prayer be accomplysshed / or else as
shortly as ye have made an end thereof that ye shall depart out of this world
/ and be presented to ye right wise judge / there to make a streyte account and
rekenyng of all the time of your life past. But peradventure some will say. why
should I think so? For I trust to live many years longer. As to that I say not
nay / but it may so fortune. Notwithshandyng you being on live at the
beginning of prayer / if it shall please god / ye may depart tofore ye have
made a perfyte end thereof. And if I would affirm this part to be true there
is no man living that may truly affirm the contrary. Therefore I hold it
much profitable thus for to think. And so doing I trust it will give you
great occasyon to devotion.

How in time of prayer sometime the mind is much dystracte by reason of
wordely besynes And remedies for the same. Ca. v.iii.
LIke as example by every thing that is heavy of the self / or laden with any
thing that depresseth the berer / sooner and more easily it may descend down
the hill / than it may ascend up the mount. Prayer is an ascencyo^ of the mind
to god as Damascene says. Li. iiii. ca xxiii ps. xii.
According also to ye words of the prophet in his psalm sayng. I have lift
up mine eyes unto the mountes. That is to say. I have made my prayer to the holy
saints in heaven / as means to god / of whom I trust help and socoure. For my
socoure and help is of god / the which made heaven and earth. wherefore every
thing yt is heavy unto the soul / does depresse the spyryte and lets
parfyte devotion / and causes many and often times distraccyon of mind in
time of prayer. According to the sayng of the Sapience. Sapi^^ie. j.
The body yt is corrupt does grieve and let the soul / and the senses do
depresse him / whose mind is occupied about many things. For vndubted in
time of prayer / there ye mind is much inclyned / where about in other times
it is most occupied. If great study / business / and care does occupy the
mind / as to get temporal riches and honors worldsy promocyo^s: or other
such pleasures: no meruel if yt soul can not be fyxed in one thing specially
if it be iner spyrytual. But prayer sith it is one of the parts of
co^templacio^ / if it be pure / it has respect only or pryncypally unto one
thing / which is god almighty. To whom prayer bears the petycyo^ of the heart /
and makes supplicacyon for help. But ye hertes of them yt be occupied in many
things can not long be fyxed on one thing / wherefore their prayer can not be
long pure without distraccio^ of mind. Martha was occupied about many things:
Luce. x
and therefore she was troubled in her mind. But Mary occupied about one / did
choose the better part. And therefore she was quiet in spyryte / and all together
conte^platyue. Of the which example we may learn / that since both these women
were holy and much accept in ye favor of god: that the labors of them which
ben prelates and take cure of other. and be content for the love of god to leave
their co^templacyon / and to take labors spirytual or temporal for their
subgectes / ben much merytoryous. For albeit yt they have distraccyo^s in their
prayer / and sometime feel not such swetnes and flame of deuocyo^ / as they
were wont to have before they did take yt office on them. yet let them be sure:
sith their labors is for god / and helpyng of souls / so much more rich is
their merytes before god. how much more is their labors and cures? In so much
yt these householders also / which dyscretly and truly does occupye the world
for the mayntenyng of their household / albeit they come^ly have dystraccio^s of
mind in time of their prayer: yet they not wylling to have such euagacions of
mind: if they often call in their mind to the remembrance of god they shall
not lose their merit. For as saint Thomas says. xxij. q^ xxxiij. arti xi^
Holy men have sometime euagacyo^s of mind in time of prayer: And he says
moreover that / yt person does pray in spyryte and truth / which moeued of
the instinceyo^ of ye holy ghost proceeds and gooth to pray. Notwithstanding
yt for weykenes of spyryte ye mind afterward be wa^dryng and dystract. For
when ye mind of him yt does pray ascends to god by contemplacion / than
anon by cause it is feeble and weyke it falls to euagacyo^s and wa^deryng
minds. But holy me^ ofte^tymes calls in their spyryt to remember what they
pray / and so they continue their devotion. And this is one general remedy /
and as a daily medicyn contynually to be used of every person against
dystraccio^s of mind / for to co^serue their attencyo^ / devotion / and merit
in prayer. Another remedy is ofte^tymes with actual intent (as much as fraylte
will suffer) to do their works and worldly besynes to the honor of god /
actually referryng them to his glory. As saint Paul says. j. Co. ^
whyther ye eat or drink / or what someuer else ye shall do do al to the glory
of god. This exercise of mind used in other prayers / shall encreas the love of
god in their hertes / whereby thyer spyrytes shall be more strong in deuocio^ to
avoid great distraccyons of mind in time of prayer. And it would be noted of
every christian man that beside the natural love which he has to his wife /
children / and servants / except in true catholyke faith of ye chirch he
endeuer himself by his good example of life to edyfye the^ in virtue / to the
honor of god and profit of their souls / he shall do little more to his
household tha^ does the pagan or turk to his famylly. For they daily do
labor and provide for their household / and naturally does love the same. But
the faithful servant of god an true crystyans must do more. Another remedy
against distraccio^s is this It is necessary for all such honest worldly lyuers
which be much troubled with scateryng mind in prayer to apply the^self to some
ordered exercise / specially in ye church of god. As after they have taken holy
water knele down in some place where they intend to rest and pray. And all
worldly besynes sequestered all grudges against neighbor al iniuryes / and
offenses clean put out of mind and remyt with meke and contryte spyryte / ask
god mercy for their unkindness and neglige^ces done and co^myth sith ye last
time they were there a^nd for all indiscreet behauour and impacyency to his
household and neighbors. And thank god for ye preseruacion of him or his / and
all christian people. And for all ye benefits of god / specially for your
creacion / rede^pcio^ and gloryficacyo^ / which we all trust to have by ye
means of his sons blyssed passion. which than let us call before our mind.
and in sure faith depely co^sydering ye lame sete us mekely thank the father of
heaven for his ineffable mercy / love / and charity / yt would send his eterne
and only beloved sone to suffe in our nature so paynfull and ignomyneous a
death to redeem man out of the thraldom of the devil. And also with all our
hertes thank our said lord Jesus christ ye sone of god for his like love / mercy
/ and charity. To whom (as saint Poule says. Ad Hebre. xii
Joy and glory profferd / all co^fusyon dyspised) would sustene the cross /
and suffer the most paynfull death for our salvation. If we would thus order
our self in the church dystraccyons should have little place in prayer. But if
the person be unlettered and much encombred with wandryng cogytacyo^s of their
heart / than it is expedye^t for such to have before their eyes some devout
remembrance or object / as some pycture of the passion of Christ / or some
other saint / to whom they have most devotion. That while senses be stayed
and fyxed in that sensyble devout image / their spyryte may more lyberally
ascend to god or to the saint to whom they pray. And for yt consyderacyon
images of saints be set up in the chyrches as books of lay me^. That they
redynge in the^ / their acts and Iestes suffered for almighty god may be styred
to devotion / and for to honor god in his holy saints. Some uses against
such dystraccions little books / in the which is contained pyctures of the
artyeles of the life and passion of our lord Jesus / and tornyng over their
leaves does worship our lord / saying for every article a Pater nr^ / an Aue
and a creed. and this exercise is good for the^ which be unlearned. and I
council them yt can have no such books to remember the said articles by the
feestes of the year. begynni^g at the natyuyte of our lord god / his
circumcysion / his epyphany / his presentacion in to the temple / his fast and
temptacyon / his death and bitter passion / his resurreccyo^ / and ascension /
with other sole^pne festes in ye year. And for each say the prayer above
rehearsed. And this done serve our lady likewise / beginning at her concepcyo^
/ natyuite / salutacyo^ / visitacyo^ / purificacyo^ / and assumpcyo^. And after
this ye apostles / martyrs: and other holy saints as their festes ca^ be
called to remembrance / or as they appear and be reprynted before the^ in their
images set up in chyrches. This order used shall call in the mind from worldly
besynes (and so distraccyo^ avoided) it shall kyndle devotion / and encreace
the merit and fruit of prayer.

Of other manner of dystraccyo^s. And of the causes and remedies of the same. Ca.
ix.
THere be other distraccyons of mind in time of prayer / ye cause whereof is
sin. For like as in bodyly sekenes he is in great ieopardy yt does abhor
all meats: and what so ever he receives he casts and vomiteth it out again:
so in likewise he is most far from devotion whose soul is most sore
wounded with many and diverse mortal sins. For very tedyous and unsavory is
prayer and al spyrytual things to such a person For if any time he begin to
pray / anon he has done / for he is so weyke in soul yt he can not continue.
He ca^ not taste nor dygest spyrytuall things / because in himself he is all
sinful and beestly. No marvel though yt person be dystract in prayer / whose
heart is sore wounded and auerted fro god and fro the life of grace: I council
him to seek for remedy betyme. Go to ye lauatory of health / and with contryte
heart make clean and hole confession. Take with him so much more huge contricion
and repentau^t sorrow. How much more by his syn^e he has deserved dampnacion
/ and has provoked the wrath / ire / and indygnacion of ye hye god
omnypotent. Let him never presume / but think himself unworthy to come in to
ye church / and to appear in the presence of god with an unpenitent heart. But
rather with the publycan for his sin judge himself unworthy to look up to heaven
/ and beat that breast and heart with his fyst which has so grievously offended /
and cry with ye publycan. Mercy lord god / mercy / mercy. A more sure remedy
or more wholesome plaster for his sores can he have none. For like as it is a
noble plaster or medycin yt heals not only the wound / but also takes a
was the skar: which comynly is left in ye flesh / so co^tricion is a noble
medicine for the soul. For it may be so great and parfite / yt it not only
cures the sin^e / but it makes ye syn^e to be in such detestacyon / yt it
does away pryntes / fantasies / pronytees / ill customs / feebleness / and
other unclean mocions to syn^e / which syn^e does leave behind it in the
soul / or at the leest does so mynisshe them yt much they do not trouble ye
spyrite. For albeit that the contrycion of some is suffycient to the remyssion
of their sins / yet it is not always so perfyte to take these foresaid and
pains and effects away and yt causes or is occasion of fantasies in time of
prayer. For when they would be much devout / and pra most hertely. yea /
sometime in heryng mass / than ye fantasyes of their sins is so brym^e in
their eyes and ymagynacion / that they have no devotion to prayer And sometime
they leave their prayer / and be so weary of such cogitacions: yt they fear
themself lest their sins be not forgyuen / or that god does forsake them /
and is sore dyspleased with the^. and it is not so. For as saint Gregory says.
Sins remyt and past / when they be brought to memory / they never hurt ye
soul / except they please them self. As when the soul has delectacion in
remembrance of the^. But if such persons would consider their own self well
/ how they never did take such pain and penance / nor had so perfyte
contrycion and sorrow for their sins that it was able to put away all
fantasyes thereof / they should se that of very justice it were expedyent for
them to have such temptacyo^s. For where they have against ye will of god
wylfully abused their own will in such sins / it is the great goodness of
god yt will suffer the^ to their pain against their wylles to be tossed and
vexed with the fantasies of the same sins / to their merit and crown in heaven
/ co^fusyon to their goostly enmy which has no ferther power on them / than
without peril to exercise and trouble them only with fantasyes / which
comynly is called the te^ptacyo^s of holy men. And therefore let them never leave
their prayer nor place for them. So holy scripture admonyssheth sayng. If the
spyryte of him yt has power ascend upon the That is as the gloss says.
Eccle. x.
If a mighty temptacyo^ assail the dymyt not and leave not thy place for it.
For the cure and health which comes thereby in the soul / shall put away and
make ceas the gretest sins. For vndubted god does suffer the to be tempted
with such fantasyes for the mortificacyon of thy senses: purgacio^ of thy sins
and for due and perfyte satysfaccio^ of ye same. Remedies against such
fa^tasies. For these foresaid co^syderacio^s it is expedyent for such persons
never to leave their prayer / but go forth always spekyng holy words. For
albeit they feel no swetnes in their words: yet ye gostly enmy feleth thereof
great pain / co^fusio^ / and shame. And if they perceive the^self sore altered
in their bodies by such thoughts / arm the^self with ye syne of ye cross and
make co^tynually inuocacio^ to ye passion of our lord for socour sayng. Lord
thy bitter passion be between me and this temptacion. Some as they might (their
hertes fyxed in ye wou^des of our lord) has cried and named continually ye
holy name of Jesus and has found remedy / and their te^ptacion has ceased For
like as every thing is cured by his contrary / and experience shows yt taking
styckes fro ye fire / it shall be sone extynct and quenched. So take away the
causes and use the contrary virtues of these te^ptacions / and all other
distractio^s in prayer / and they shall cease. The causes of distraccions in
prayer is not only ye great enorme lines as heresy / homicide / usury / and
other like / but also great multitude of venyall sins and generally all
mortal sins be occasyo^ and causes of dystraccyon.. cor. iij
For albeit venial sins takes not grace away fro ye soul yet where they be
in custom and great habou^dau^ce the soul ca^ not without great labor attene to
feel ye swetnes of devotion. for ye senses has so delyted in the^ as outward
and se^syble plesures: yt it can not savor nor taste notably ye inward swetnes
of ye spiryt / which ye spirit sore desires. Among all mortal sins I
note.vi. yt specially dysposeth to distraccio^s: yt is pride / e^uy / ire
glotony / lechery / and couetise. Pride inclyneth to vayn glory / and ypocrisy
/ and to thoughts of elacio^ of hi^ self. for ye proud persons mind is so
besy yt whereso ever he go or bide / stand or sit he speaks to himself. And
therefore he can do none otherwise in payer but whiles his tongue speaks one
word his heart thinks another And ofte^tyme he ymagineth yt never was nor
never shall be. Remedy for these we may soon have / if we in time of prayer
will take good head and custody of our heart / and dyspise all vaynglory and
praise of creature. abhor ypocresy / and meke our self to god. and prepare
our hertes specially in the beginning of prayer. For lack of due preparacion
in ye beginning / and for yt we are neglygent in orderyng our hertes to our
prayer / causes us to have little devotion in our hertes / nor swetnes in our
prayer. And contrary wise good order in the beginning expels dystraccyo^s:
and induces fervor of spyrite. Example we may take of ye holy woman Judith /
which as scripture shows wha^ she should make her prayer to god / she did
cast away all her gay array / and did clothe her self with sack. Iu. ix.
cast dust upon her heed / and fasted and watched in great penance. Of queen
Hester we read also / yt not only she did all these with great weeping and
waylyng. as it is open in the book of Hester / but also she fyled her heed with
dust and donge. ^e. xiiij
And yede to every place where she had by her pride and mirth dyspleased god.
and there she teared her here in detestacyo^ of her syn^e. Omeli. xxiij.
Mary magdalene also when she yede to here ye holy word of our lords prechi^g
(as saint Gregory says) she did take with her so great co^trycyo^ / yt she made
a sacrefyce of every part of her body / wherewith she had offe^dyd god If she
had this preparacio^ of heart when our lord did speak unto her. no less ought
we to have wha^ we shall come in presence and speak to god which undoubted we
do as doctors says / wha^ we pray to him. Tha^ al ye malice / and impacyency
should be fer fro us / which causes dystraccyons of mind in prayer / nothing
more. For Mary for the love which she had to god and her neighbor was worthy
to here these words of our lord / the great multitude of her sins be
forgyue^ / because she loves much / let us ever remember ye words of our
savior. Lu. vij
Ma. vi et. xviij
Except ye remyt each other with your hertes* your fader in heaven will not remyt
nor forgive your sins. All these examples of these holy women ben written in
the holy scripture of god / and left for our example and erudycion. Let us
therefore with Mary magdalene when we shall come to pray / weep and wayle our
sins. Call to our remembrance with queen Hester the times / the places / the
persons / and the parts of our body. And also the words / ye deeds and the
thoughts / in the which we have offended the hye god omnipote^t / and there
tear our here / yt is to be actually sorry for them and have them in
detestacio^ / and be dyspleased with our self / which so unkindly have offended
our most loving and merciful fader in heaven. And I praise it much when ye
meke and contrite heart speaks to god in the mother tongue / praysyng his holy
name / or askyng mercy for his sins. Nothing tha^ should be so much before
our eyes / nor with much occupy our hertes as heaven / which myserably we have
lost by syn^e. And hell to the which we have bound our self by syn^e / and yt
perpetually except we amend our co^uersacion. Let us therefore for cloth /
clothe our self with sack / as Judith did / yt is to say. Meke our self in
our hertes: and evermore remember how unworthy we be to come to ye presence of
god and speak to him And in this example of this holy woman we may learn and
perceive how little it pleases god / or promoteth praer to come to ye church in
gay apparel or clothing / except we use our self warely therein. For nothing
more distracteth ye mind / and hurts prayer and devotion tha^ ye inordynate
and curyous affeccio^s and thoughts of such vanitees. I will not say but it
is co^me^dable on ye holy day to a^orne our bodies honestly / so yt our minds
be not alienate fro god thereby. Let us also with queen Hester cast dust and
do^ge upon our hedes. That is to remember not only how we be mortal / dust /
ashes / and earth. and to the^ torn again we shall. But also cast dong on
our heed / yt is knowledge of our self ye most vile slynking and unkind syn^er
yt lives. If you look man straight before thyn eyes / and judge not thy neybour /
for in ease it is not lawful for ye. and I suppose that you may well think so
on thy self / whom only in heart thou know and no other. Many because their
conscience murmures not / they thy^ke the^self sure / but yt is a falls suerty.
For as saint Poule says. I know no syn^e in my co^scye^ce / but yet in yt I am
not iustyfied. But the day of our lord shall show and declare what every man
is / wha^ our miserable soul shall be brought before ye tribunal of ye hye
judge god almighty / there to abide yt most terryble sentence of ye justice of
god almighty. Either to everlasting life or endless pain. If we would daily
exercise our self in this manner of preparacio^ to our prayer not only we should
avoid great distractyons of mind but also we should do due fruit of penance
for our sins. Some there be which be much let in prayer by fantasyes and
diverse thoughts and cogytacyons and yet they be not much intryked nor fyled
with mortal sin. And the cause of their dystraccyo^ is supposed to be great
habu^dau^ce of venyall sins. For now a days many be given to sportes / games
and desolate myrthe / and specially to delycate fedyng of meats and drynkes
and idle speech All which be poison to devotion and much let to prayer and
occasion of fa^tasies. For all such dissolute mirth / vayn speech and fedyng is
so pleasant to ye senses yt they suffocate ye spirit / and lets ye soul
fro rejoicing in spu^al things. Avoid this case and deuocyo^ will follow in
prayer Delight in such vanytees / and not only ye shall droune deuocio^. but
also ye shall make your self a uessell fyt for every te^ptacyon. Many there be
clean and incorrupt in body. but for lack of custody of their heart fro ye for
said vices has fallen in to great te^ptacyo^ of ye body / and so has been sore
trobled with unclean thoughts / specially in time of prayer. de so^n^ bono. l^
il j. Ca^ xxxviij
And all this is suffered of god / for to suppress their pride norysshed by
such fedyng and dissolucyon. For ye grcte clerk ysid says god suffers yt
proud person because he will not se himself to fall in te^ptacion of lechery /
which is so manifest yt sensibly he may se his own bestlynes / and so learn to
meke himself yet some there be yt be cleue / and both vtuous and holy / and
yet be sore troubled with such unclean thoughts and steringes of ye body which
trobleth the^ / and specially in time of prayer. ii. Cor xij.
and this is suffered of god to keep the^ in mekenes. So had saint Poule ye
stimulacio^ of his flesh and sore was trobled with it / and al was to keep hy^
in mekenes / lest ye great habu^dau^ce of grace and reuelacio^s should make hy^
proud. wherefore such fa^tasies and unclean cogitacions workith no hurt / where
there is no consent to the^for more profit is the custody and preseruacyon of
mekenes with exercise of temptacyon to the meke person than is hurt to have
sometime dystraccyon. Some be so dull in spyrite that albeit their conscience
does not much reprove them of sin / yet they be very slow to exercise
themself in virtue. And such comynly be slepy and sluggysshe in their prayer.
And ye cause thereof I suppose is not only heaviness of complexyon / but also
by reason of hotenesse of conscience they think themself sure without syn^e.
And so put not themself to pain to labor for the increase of grace and
devotion / which peradventure they might have above other if they would put
their dylygece thereto / for they have less impedymentes than other / and that
causes the^ sometime to think in their hertes how they need not to fast / nor
pray much / nor watch / for they have no great sins. But all such which be
neither cold nor hot / but rather do begin to be lothesome to our lord as
scripture says. I would advise them to mark this point well. Better it is
after many fyn^es remyt and forgiven strongly to fight for the love of god and
for their own salvation / than in few sins without battle weykely to desire
heaven. Appoc. ij.
In all these dystraccions and in such otherlyke which comes by reason of
sickness or inordynate thought. Remove ye cause and ye shall find remedy. But
those persons which be dull in spyrite I would counsel to use oftentimes
depely some article or point of Crystes passion. such as most sensybly may
move them to devotion. Example who may consider yt unspeakable pain which the
sone of god did suffer for our sins upon the cross / where neither
standing upon carpytes / nor syttyng upon cuysshyns / but hanging with all
the weight of his blyssed body upon boystous nails of yren / which did tear
and rent his hands and fete wherein were most synewes / veins: and bones to
his importable pain. And who may this in true faith depely consider but it
will styre and moeue him to love and devotion / and to take pains for their
own saluacyo^? For as ye fla^me comes of the fire / so comes devotion of
love and charity. wherefore holy persons should be much inward and attent in
the time of their prayer. For when the fla^me of devotion is tender / sometime
the leest cast of the sight aside / or alienacyo^ of any other of ye senses may
extinct it and put it out. notwtstanding yt the fire of charity remains in
their souls: which if they will labor and blow well by the exercise of this
forsayde holy point of our lords passion or any such other / they may kyndell
and recover the fla^me of deuocyo^ again to their comfort. which fla^me if
they can not recover / making their prayer in charity / albeit they feel ye
less swetnes in prayer / yet so co^tynuyng they shall not lose their merit.

As says saint Thomas and other doctors mo.

How a man may order himself in time of prayer. Ca. x.
HEre before after my simple lerning I have spoken of certain means: yt
which used tofore the beginning of prayer may excitate and gretely dispose the
mind to ye fervor of devotion in the prayers folowi^g. But it is oftentimes
seen yt some men at the beginning of prayer be well and devoutly disposed. and
afterward as they proceed their affection decays / and their deuocyo^
begins by little and little to be cold. The cause of this as I suppose / is
the multitude of fa^tasmes and vain thoughts ye which by the suggestion of
our goostly enmy / will enterprise to have possession and dominion in the soul
of man / and so to exclude the fervor of devotion and spiritual affeccion.
wherefore how to avoid such vnprofityble cogytacions I shall show you a
remedy ye which I think is very expedient for to use This remedy I have red
in a book of reuelacions ye which it pleases god to show to a certain holy
co^te^platyf fader. There he says he saw in his co^templacion ye soul of a
Carthusian assu^pted unto heaven of a great co^pony of glorious angels and
fayntes / where as it was magnyfice^tly gloryfyed / for the manyfold virtuous
deeds yt he used in the time of his life past. but in special he had one great
accidental reward because yt he used in the time of sayng his service for
every verse yt he said / to remember one of ye blyssed wou^des of our savior
Jesus christ most ple^teously bledi^g as hangyng on ye cross. This is ye remedy
yt I would have my spyrytuall friends to use against ye vain and unprofitable
cogitacyo^s yt in time of prayer will importunely knock at ye gates of our
hertes. Unto this councelleth the holy apostle saint Peter in the.iiij.
chapyter of his first epistle / saying. Christo igitur passo in carne: and vos
eadem cogitatione armamini. Seeing that Christ suffered passion in his passyble
body / look that ye use the remembrance of the same as a strong armor or
defense. The remembrance of this blyssed passyo^ may well be called a strong
armor. For it is so strong and of such virtue / yt against it there can none
of our mortal enemies (that is to say neither the world / nor the flesh /
nor the devil) prevail nor have ye vyctory. But whanso ever we be most
troubled with them / if we call this to mind / they will anon vanyshe away /
as does the smoke of fire in the air.

There is no te^ptacions: no trybulacions. nor none other aduersytees that may
have ye better or vpperhande of this. And therefore saint Augustyn on this manner
speaks of himself: In omnibus temptacio^nibus. etc. In all temptacio^s /
trybulacions / and aduersytees I find never so efficacial and sure remedy as
in ye blyssed wou^des of our savior Jesus christ. wherefore devout chrystia^s I
will exhort and advise you in all trybulacio^s: whyther they be spyrytuall or
corporal / to arm you with this impenetrable harneys of the passion of Christ.
That is to say / with de memory of this blyssed wou^des. And not only in the
time of aduersite / but also in prosperyte. And most specially / as now for
my purpose I will council you to use this medytacyon or remembrance in time
of praer. For very hard it is / and almoost impossyble for any man the which
does not understand (at the leest) the lytterall sense of his prayer / for to
keep his mind contynully eleuate and lytte up to almighty god in devotion /
and upon the due cyrcumstaunces thereof. wherefore necessyte will cause and
compel him to admyt some other cogytacyons and thoughts beside the sense of
ye prayer. But so it is that every man should eschew and put from him at all
times / but most specially in time of prayer vnfruytfull and unprofitable
thoughts / and keep his mind steadfastly as much as he may upon good
spiritual thoughts but as I suppose there is none more spu^all / nor more
fruytfull than is ye medytacyon of ye wou^des of Christ wherefore I will council
you yt be unlearned and perceive not the lyterall sense of your prayer. and also
I hold it profitable for you yt be learned in the time thereof to let your mind
be occupied with the remembrance of these precious wou^des. If ye thus do / tha^
shall ye exclude the vain and unprofitable cogitacio^s of worldly things.
Than shall ye be much quiet in your souls fro te^ptacio^s of your ghostly
enmyes. Tha^ shall ye be fervent in deuocio^. And than shall ye offer up to god
your prayer more odoriferous / more sweet / and more acceptable to him / than
is the fragrau^t fume of incense.

How after prayer will follow te^ptacyo^s of vayneglory. And how they may be
eschewed and avoided by diverse remedies. Ca. xi.
SHortly after this manner of devout prayer or else in ye time thereof your
ghostly enmy will be besy to tempt you to ye vice of vayneglory / and so (if he
ca^) cause you not only to lose ye merit of your devout prayer / but also
beside yt grievously to offend god / by the reason of this detestable syn^e.
wherefore it is nedeful to be cyrspect. and wha^ ye perceive your self to be
assailed with such te^ptacyo^s anon mekely subdue your self to god / unfeignedly
knowlegyng yt if ye have prayed devoutly it is your duty so to do. And yet be
nothing able so to do as of your self / but only it comes of ye great goodness
and grace of almighty god. That we can do nothing yt good is / as of our self
does wytnes saint Poule saying. No^ sufficie^tes sumus. etc. ii. co. iii.
we be not suffycie^t as of our selfs to thynk any good thought / but all our
suffycie^cy is of god. That all thing yt is good comes of ye grace of god it
appears well by ye words of ye same apostle in another place where he says
that he has taken more labor in prechynge yt word of god tha^ all ye other
apostles. But than he quyckly somthi^g wtdrawi^g these words says. No^ ego:
sed gr^a dei mecu^. It was not I. but it was the grace of god with me. Right so
my fre^des wha^ ye be tempted to vaynglory / either for sayng of your prayers
devoutly / or for doing any other good deed / quickly make answer to your
gostly enmy / sayng with saint Poule. It was not I yt did this good deed / but it
was the grace of god with me. And by this mean keeping your selfs in mekenes / yt
is to say Hertely knowlegyng yt no goodness comes of our self but it comes of
ye mercy of god / ye shall not only have the merit of your devout prayer / but
also ye shall deserve a crown in heaven for ye vyctory of your gostly enmy / by
resisting of his te^ptacio^s. But it fortuneth many times yt wha^ a man has by
the grace of god and such m^^^nes as I have now said / resysted a te^ptacio^
of vaynglory. by and by there follows an other te^ptacion to ye same vice more
subtylly and much more craftily than did the first. For wha^ a man has
resisted one te^ptacio^ of the said vaynglory / the devil will be ready cast in
ye mind of the resistent / yt he has done a noble act / and yt he is worthy
to have a great reward of god with such other flateryng cauyllacio^s / ye
which be more peryllous than the first. And after these if they be resysted /
peradventure he will multyply mo / in so much yt he will trouble the devout man
so sore yt he shall uneath know what is best for him to do. but I will advise
every sweet soul to be of good comfort / and strong in god / taking such
importune temptacyons as a scourge or flagellacyon for his sins past / in ye
which he has grievously offended almighty god. And though he be sore troubled
therewith / yet let him ever have a constant purpose to resyste / as much as
shall lie in him / making the sign of the cross in his for heed / and
calling to remembrance the blessed wounds of our savior Jesus christ. And
than call to him sayng as did his dyscyples. Mathei octauo. when they were
troubled with tempests upon the water Domine salua nos: perimus. Save us good
lord / or else we shall perysshe. He that will thus do / let him trust surely
to have remedy. And truly he shall not fail thereof / but quickly he shall be
delivered fro the ieopardous tempest of temptacyon. or else have grace /
strength / and patiently to suffer them. And after this life gloryfyed in the
kingdom of heaven. For he says by the mouth of his prophet. Psalmo. lxxxx.
Quonia^ in me sperauit: liberabo eu^. etc. Because he trusts in me I will
deliver him. I will defend him because he did know my name. He cried on me and
I shall graciously here him. I am with him in his trybulacion / from the which I
shall take him and gloryfy him. Also the apostle saint Paul in his first
epistle unto the Corynthyens speaks to the consolacyon of such persons that
be much troubled with te^ptacyons sayng. Hidelis aute^ deus. etc. Almighty god
is faithful the which wylt not suffer us to be tempted forther than he will
give us grace for to resyst. But in time of temptacyo^ he will give you grace
to resyst / and also torn it to your great spyrytuall profit. Also saint
Bernard says in his fyfth sermon de quadragesima. Sub te est o homo appetitus
tuus. etc O man / says he: thyn appetyte is under thyn own governance / and
thou art ye lord of it. Thy enmy may moeue thy to temptacyons / but it is in
thy liberty whyther thou will consent or not. when he tempts the to pride
/ vaynglory / glotony / vanite / impacyence / lechery / or any such other /
look you do not consent. And as often as thou do resyst / so often thou shall be
crowned with crowns of glory. to the which bring us / be that on the cross
dyed for us. Amen.

How the fynall intent of our prayers should be the laud and praise of god. And
how he may lawfully desire in prayer all other things necessaryly referrynge
them to this end. Ca. xij.
IT pleased almighty god of his infynit goodness to creat and make man to his
image and symilytude yt he and his posteryte might supply the places in heaven /
fro whens / Lucyfer with his adherentes did fall for their pride. for the end
yt they may perpetually give lauds and praise to their maker with the glorious
angels in heaven wherefore my devout friends we should refer our prayers: and
all other good deeds yt we shall have grace for to do finally to this end. Not
withsta^dyng we may lawfully desire in our prayers all things necessary and
expedyent both to our souls / and also to our bodies. Having ever in purpose
the fynall intent / of ye which I spoke before. After the mind of the sweet
and mellyfluous doctor holy saint Bernard saying in his sermon before said.
All things yt we need to desire in prayer / may be conclude in.iij. peticio^s.
Of the which one perteyneth to ye body / another to ye soul / the.iij. to ye
beatitude of the life eternal. In ye first peticion yt perteyneth to ye body of
man we may lawfullly desire of god all things yt be necessary thereto / as
meat / drink / and clothes: with such other / by ye which we may be ye better
sustained in holy service. In ye second peticion we may desire in prayer all
thing necessary for our souls: as for grace and virtues. etc. and for these we
should pray often / devoutly / and fervently. In ye third peticio^ we should
desire with all affeccio^ and love to have the life eternal. For the end (as I
said before) yt we may vnceasyngly laud and praise yt magnyfice^t lord / yt
did create and make us to his lykenes. But in these. iii. peticio^s it is
necessary to observe.iii. things. For in the first many times there is
superfluite / in ye second impurete / and in the.iij. elacyon or pride. For
often times we desire to have super fluite and more than is necessary of
te^porall things. And sometime we desire to have virtues yt we may make
oste^tacyo^ / or host our selfs therein. And peradventure sometime we seche how
to obtain ye life eternal. Not with humylyte and mekenes but with a falls
confidence in our own meries or deseruinges. Therefore we must take heed when we
pray for temporal things yt we desire no more but as necessite requires. wha^
we pray for virtues yt we may be frefro i^purete / yt is to say yt we desire
not virtues to make ostentacyon and bostyng thereof. And when we pray for ye
life eternal / yt we nothing presume of our own merytes or deservings: but
only on the great mercy and goodness of god. And to my purpose yt we should
refer all these finally to the laud and praise of him yt did create and
make us / it appears well by the words of saint augustine i^ his.x. omelye
where he says yt no true crystyan should desire to have all te^porall and
transitory things. But all the effect of his intencion and prayer should be ye
eternal beatitude where as he may laud and praise his creator and maker
perpetually with all glorious saints. And when it pleases god to give us
te^porall goods according to our prayers / tha^ should we give him due thanks
for the^ / and when it pleases him to take the^ fro us: yet nevertheless should
we thank him. And in this part keep us indifferent to be co^tendted when it
shall please him to take the^ fro us. but let us pray devoutly / hertely /
instau^tly yt he never take him himself nor his grace fro us.

For whom we should pray. Ca. xiii.
IT is a laudable custom in ye church of Christ to pray for three states or
degrees: in ye which be contained such persons for whom it is necessary to
pray. That is to say ye spiritualte the temporalte / and the souls in
purgatory. The church does not command us to pray for them yt be in heaven /
for they have no need thereof. Nor for the yt be in the pains of hell / for to
the^ prayer can not pro fyte. But we should pray for the^ yt be in this world
lyuinge / and for the souls yt be in purgatory. First we should pray for the
spiritualte / as for our holy fader ye pope with all his subgectes: mynistres of
the church / and specially for ye bishop our dyocesan / and such as under him
has ye cure of our souls: Seco^darily we should pray for the te^poralte / and
specially for ye kings grace / with all such yt under him be rulers and
gouerners of the realm. And in this part every man (if he be of ye teporalte)
ought pricipally to pray for himself. And if he be of ye spu^alte likewise to
do in yt part / and than for his parents: kynsfolkes: and bn^fanctours / and
than generally for all other christianes: both good and bad (as says saint
Augustyn in ye beginning of his third sermon on ye.xij. sunday after ye
trynite.) For the good yt they may profit and encreas in goodness. For the
bad yt they may have grace to amend. Also well done it is to pray for
heretykes and infydels: yt they may have grace to forsake their errors and
infidelite / and be reco^syled and brought to ye veryte of christian faith. and
Besides these our savior cyryst byddeth us pray for our enmyes yt do persecute
and trouble us. And surely so we have great cause. For if we take their
persecuryons pacyently for ye love of god / they shall gretely augme^t and
encreas our crowns and rewards in heaven. Now to make a short conclusion in
this part / we should pray generally for all things necessary to be prayed
for.

Thyrdly we should pray for ye souls yt ben in ye pains of purgatory / and
therefore it is wryte^. i. machab. i
Scta^ ergo and salubris cogitacio. etc. It is an holy and a holso^ thought to
pray for ye souls yt be deed / yt they may be delivered from pain infilicte
for their sins. And saint Augustyn says in his.xliiij. sermon ad fr^es in
Heremo. Ora ergo pro defu^ctis. etc. Pray for ye souls of the^ yt be deed. And
wha^ they come to ye life eternal / they will not forgette to pray for you. But
it these days there be many heretykes yt say and affirm that there is no
purgatory / in the which the souls of them that then departed fro this life
be purged fro the fylthnesse of syn^e. But anon as they depart they go either
to heaven or to hell. I might bring in diverse auctorytees of holy scripture to
confute this false opinion with / but as now I will let them pass / partly
because thatof late catholycall and great famous clerks in their books lately
compyled: has confuted such opynyons much more strongly than my simple
lerning is able to do. And partly because it was my purpose in ye beginning to
write this poor treatise as an erudicion of prayer to such as have but small
or none under sta^dyng in holy scripture / and not as a co^futacion of
heretykes. But I will beseech you all my spu^all fre^des for whom I have taken
this labor / in the blyssed wounds of our savior Jesus Christ / if ye here
any persons speak either of this / or of any such other false erronyous
opynions: that ye give to them no credence / nor argue ye not with them in the
cause if they be learned and pe unlearned / lest peradventure they might seduce
your intellygence by subtle arguments: apperyng to your natural reason as
they were true / wha^ it is the contrary. But rather withdraw your presence
fro their company / dyscussing nothing in your mind that excedeth your lernyng
/ but mekely and steadfastly believe as the church of Christ does instruct you
And as holy doctors and saints inspyred with the holy ghost has left here
behind the^ on this earth for our erudicion. I will speak no more of this
matter now / but torn again to my purpose / desyring you over in your devout
prayers to remember the souls in purgatory and specially ye souls of your
pare^tes kinsfolk and friends / and benefactours. And of your benign charity
for those souls ye which I your poor servant and beedman am most bounden
to pray for. And generally for all ye souls in purgatory / yt it will please
almighty god of his infynyte mercy to release the^ fro their pains and take
the^ to his great glory and joy / ye which ye same god omnipote^t grant to
us all immedyatly after yt we depart fro this life. Amen.

How he yt will have his prayer ascend to god must make it.ij. wings. Ca.
xiiij.
^er. lx. de^^ ^or^.
Saint Augustine says yt who so ever will have his prayer fle or ascend to god /
must prepare for it.ij. wings: yt is to say / fasting and alms deeds. And
saint Bernard in his fourth sermon upon ye epiphany of our lord affirms ye
same / calling these.ij. wings afflyccion of the flesh / and co^te^pt or
dyspysyng of the world And though these.ij. doctors differ in ye words: yet
do they co^corde in the significacion of the^. For fasting is an afflyccion or
punyssheme^t of ye flesh / and gyuing alms is a dyspising of the world. For
ye shall se but few men yt has great affeccion and love to the goods of the
world yt will use much to give alms. But ye less affeccion yt a man has to
worldly gods: ye more large will he be in gyuynge alms. These doctors do say
yt when a devout prayer has these.ij. wings it will fle into heaven swyftly /
and there without doubt it shall gracyously be herd. wherefore I will exhort every
devout person dyscretely to use fasting and gyuing of alms. But perchance
some man will say to me. I am aeged or gretely diseased with infyrmytees and
sickness yt I may not fast. Also I am so poor yt I am not able to give alms
/ how tha^ should I prepare these.ij. wings for my prayer? As to ye first I
make this answer sayng / ye abstine^ce and fasting was not ordained for such
as be of great aege / nor for such as be much vexed with infyrmytees. But it
was ordained for such persons as be lusty and strong to subdue and chastyse
ye superfluous fyersnes of ye flesh / yt by ye means thereof ye sensual
appetites may be ye better subgected unto reason. Wherefore if you yt be aeged
or vexed with i^firmitees have a good mind to fast if ye were able thereto. I
doubt not but almighty god will accept your good will / as if ye did perform ye
thing in deed. This I speak of corporal abstinence or bodyly fasting. But
there is another called spu^all abstine^ce: / yt is to abstene fro vices and
sins / in ye which a man has been accustomed by along season. He yt is old
or seek may keep this abstyne^ce / as well or better than he yt lusty and
strong. And this every true christian man is bound to keep as well the old as
the young / the seek as ye hole. The other yt is to say corporal abstinence is
ordained as for a mean or help to this. The other is good and profitable for
such as be able to keep.ij. but this is ye better and more perfect and it
should be observed of every person. wherefore if ye old and seek persons keep
this abstine^ce in deed / and the other in will / yt is to say / yt they would
be glad to keep it if they were able / it is not to be feared but they do
suffycie^tly prepare this one wyng of prayer. And if ye other persons yt be
lusty and strong in their bodies do wisely and discretely observe both
corporal and the spu^all abstyne^ce / tha^ do they also on their part well
prepare this one wynge of prayer. As to the second where the seek man says he
is so poor that he is not able to give alms. I make this answer / sayng that
(after ye mind of saint Augustyn) there is.ij. ^ru^^ia. xlii
manner of alms the one is to forgive the^ hertely yt has offended you Or
(after saint Gregory) to give instruccyon of vtues to them yt be ignorant / to
give council to them yt have need thereof / to give co^solacion to the^ yt be
co^fortles / and so forth of other like. And this manner of alms he yt is in
pouerte (for temporal goods) may give as largely as he yt has great richesse
and worldly substance. The other alms yt saint Augustyn speaks of ^is to
give meat to ye hongry / drink to the thyrsty / clothe ye naked. etc. To give
this alms cou^celeth us our lord spekyng by his prophet ysay / where he
says. Frange esurienti pane^ tuu^. etc. ^. lviii.
that is to say. Break thy bread to him that is hongry. Give hospytalyte to the
poor people yt labor in journey. And when you see a man yt is naked / give
him clothes. It belongs specially to ye rich man to give this alms / but
not only to him. For the poor man yt has but little substance / if he give
part of that with a good will he shall have as great a reward of god / as the
rich man yt gives great and large alms. And this appears well by ye words
of our savior Christ in ye gospel of Luke where he says / yt the poor woman
yt offered but.ij. ^. xxi.
mynutes: the which be a ferthyng / offered more tha^ all the rich men did.
And yet every one of them by large gifts did offer. And if a man be so poor
yt he has nothing / yet if he have only a good mind / and would be glad for
the love of god to give alms if he had worldly substance / his mind will be
accepted for ye deed. Now than it appears will that every man both poor and
rich may give alms both spiritually and corporally as I have beforesayd.
wherefore my devout friends I will exhort you to follow the counsel of the
holy man Choby / where he says. ca. iiii.
Ex substantia tua fac elemosina^. etc. Of thy substance look that you give
alms / and torn not thy face away fro any poor man that does ask the / and
tha^ our lord will not torn his face fro the. Have mercy and pity on ye poor
/ and give to them alms as thy goods will extend. If thou beryche and have
great substance give than a large alms. If you have but little yet give part
thereof as thou may / with a good will. If thou have nothing / yet at the leest
look that you have a good mind. This doing thou shall prepare for the a great
reward in ye day of necessyte. For alms will deliver the from all sin / and
from death yt should follow there upon. And it will not suffer this soul to
come in derkenes / but it will give the a great hope and trust of salvation /
when thou shall appear to fore the face of god omnypotent. Also unto this
exhorts us our master Christ in ye.xi. chapter of Luke / sayng. Date
elemosinam: et ecce omnia munda sunt vobis. Give ye alms / and than all
things be clean to you. For it is written. Elemosina resistit peccatis. Eccle.
iii.
Alms does resist vice and sin. wherefore it follows in the.vij. chapter.
Elemosinamfacere ne despicias. Ca. xxxi
Despise not to give alms / but as it follows. Conclude elemosinam in sinu
pauperis. etc. Pryuely put thine alms in to the bosom of the poor man / and
tha^ it will pray for the to god. For as it is in the.iii. chapter of ye same
book. Sicut aqua extinguit igne^. etc. Like as water does quench ye fire / so
alms does quench the pain ordained for syn^e. wherefore my intierly beloved
fre^des I will advise you to use often times to give alms as I have said tofore.
And tha^ ye shall perfytely make the second wynge of prayer. The which prayer
set about with the other wynge of abstynence and this wyng of alms will
ascend and fle quykly unto the celestyall country / and there prepare for you
a mansyon or dwelling place / in the which ye shall rest perpetually / with
all blyssed angels and saints gyuyng reverence and honor / land and praise
vnceasyngly / to the most glorious Trynite. Cui sit honor et gloria per
infinita secula seculorum. Amen.
