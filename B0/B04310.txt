THE True Lovers Tragedy: Being an Incomparable Ballad of a Gentleman and his
Lady, That both Killed themselvels for Love, under the disguised Names of
Philander and Phillis.
Phillis Philanders scattered Garments finds,
And thinks him slain, for which with Fate she joins,
And with her Fatal Poniard strikes deep,
As Life no longer can it is station keep,
The Crimsoe Streams so fast flowd from her Veins,
Yet Dying, of her Loves dear loss complains:
No sooner Death had closed up her Starry eyes,
But her returned Philander her espyes;
And finding that for him she lost her breath,
He kills himself, and crowns his Love with death.
To the Tune of, Ab Cruel Bloody Fate.


AH Cruel Bloody Fate,
what can thou now do more?
Alas it is now too late,
Philander to Restore;
Why should the Heavenly powers pedswade,
Poor Mortals to believe,
That they guard us here,
And reward us there,
Yet all our joys deceive.
Her Poniard then she took,
and held it in her hand,
Then with a dying look,
cried thus I Fate command:
Philander! ah my Love I come,
to meet the shade below;
Ah! I come she cried,
with a wound so wide,
There needs no second blow.
Then Purple Waves of Blood,
ran streaming down the floor,
Vnmov'd she saw the Flood,
and blessed her dying hour:
Philander, and Philander still,
the bleeding Phillis cried,
She wept a while,
and forced a smile,
then closed her Eyes and died.
Upon the Blushing Ground,
stained with her Virgin blood,
She lay in Deaths deep Swound,
close by the murmering Flood:
Which for the lovely Phillis sake,
complan'd of cruel late,
Which had caused such care,
as had wrought despair,
I weep it to relate.


When lo Philander came,
with joy to seek his Love,
And her dear promise claim,
while Moan-beams from above,
Did twincle through the thickest shade,
and guild the flowery plain,
When he espys,
And ah Phillis cries
(not thinking she was slain)
Arise, arise from Earth,
shake off this dull repose,
Phillis my only mirth,
to thee Philander bows,
Sooner I would have come to thee,
had not a Lion staid,
My course to fight,
For which exploit,
he Lifeless now is made.
Ah me what is this! she is cold,
ye Gods quite breathless too,
O Death durst thou infold,
this beauties not thy due:
Alas? O cruel Fate he cried,
by her own hand it is well
Oh the fatal blow,
That did overthrow,
by Heavens for me she fell.
Behold my Garments died
in Phillis precious blood,
Which falling from my side,
made her suppose me dead:
And therefore fell for love of me,
ah cruel destiny.
And shall Philander
Live to wander,
No by the Powers i will dye?
I come my Phillis now,
prepare, for in thy Arms,
I will perform my vow,
a sleep like Death now charms:
These Ciprus wreaths our Crowns shall be
we will Triumph over death,
From thy fair lip,
I Will Nectar Sip,
Then with my latest breath.
With that his Fatal Sword,
he plunged in his breast,
and sighed with dying words,
Oh now I am at rest,
Now Phillis now for ever mine,
Fate now no more shall part,
Then through the Wound,
Life passage found,
And left the Lovers Heart.
FINIS.
