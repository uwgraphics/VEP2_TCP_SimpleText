Die Lunae, 17 Iulii, 1648.
We the Commons in Parliament assembled, Taking into our consideration the
late high Insurrection in Kent, so suddenly and wonderfully quelled by the
blessing of God, upon that small Part of the Army under the conduct of the Lord
Fairfax General, cannot but be deeply sensible of the evil demerits of such
persons as have any ways had a hand therein; as also of the mischevious
consequences that offenders in so high a nature should go unpunished, yet are
we desirous to use all possible lenity toward those who are in any measure
capable thereof.

And do therefore hereby declare, that although we see a necessity that some
capital examples be made, yet shall our principal aim therein be, that all
may be warned by the punishment of few.

And although others who have thus employed their estates against the
Parliament and Kingdom, to the raising and fomenting of new distractions and
troubles have justly incurred a total forfeiture of the same, toward the
repairing of the public losses and damages by them occasioned, yet shall we
thereunto extend only the Sequestration of the estates of the principal
actors, namely such as have been formerly in arms against the Parliament, or
in former Insurrections in that County, or who have taken upon them to Act in
this Insurrection, as Commissioners or Commanders, or who have been therein
notoriously active in Plunderings, or Imprisonments, and such Ministers as have
been active in this Insurrection, and as for such other persons who only
through ignorance or weakness in themselves, and the subtilties or threats of
others have been seduced or terrified into some mistaken or unwilling
compliance in that action, we do hereby warn all those not to flatter
themselves for the future, in such unworthy principals, so prone and easy to
be wrought upon to join with evil doers.

And do likewise hereby require every such person who expects the favor of
this so gentle a warning, that they engage themselves that they will never
bear arms against the two Houses of Parliament, or against any that derive
Authority from them, nor wittingly do any thing to the prejudice of their
affairs, or to the disturbance of the Peace of that County, upon which said
engagement entered into by such persons as come not under any the aforesaid
former qualifications of principal actors, or who having been taken by the
Lord General as Prisoners of war, are not by him already set apart by lot,
or otherwise for a judicial trial to be appointed by this House, the said
engagers (not as before excepted) and every of them are hereby declared to be
freely pardoned, and so long as they shall demeasne themselves according to
their said engagement, are not to be proceeded against by any mulct or penalty
whatsoever for the said offense, nor to be any ways liable for the same,
otherwise then what they are and shall be liable unto by action or suit at law,
for satisfaction unto particular persons by them damnified, wherein each
particular person is left unto his legal remedy for reparations or recovery of
damages as if this Declaration had not been made.

And the Churchwarden or Churchwardens of the several parishes within the said
County for the time being, are hereby required to provide and keep a register
or book wherein the said engagement is to be written and subscribed as
aforesaid, within three days after notice of this Declaration unto any of the
said persons who expect the benefit thereof.

And the Ministers of the said several Parishes are hereby required openly to
read this Declaration in their several Parish Churches upon the next Lords day
after the receipt thereof, at some convenient time before the dismissing of the
Congregation from the mornings exercise; And at the same time to give the
people some seasonable instructions and exhortations, touching their duty of
thankfulness unto God for so great a mercy, as the speedy suppressing of that
Insurrection; as also touching their duty of quiet and peaceable demeanor
toward those who are in public place and authority; and to take heed of the
Councels and Practices of those, who upon what pretense soever are the Stirrers
up of seditions and tumults.

And the Committee of the said County are hereby required to take care of the
speedy dispersing of this Declaration, and to take a strict account of what is
due according as is hereby required by the Ministers and other persons
respectively concerned.
