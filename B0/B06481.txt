To His Excellence, WILLIAM Earl of NEWCASTLE, Viscount Mansfield, Lord Ogle,
Baron of Bolsover, Bothall, and Hepple, Governor of the Town and County of
Newcastle, General of all His Majesty's Forces in the North Parts of this
Kingdom, and in the Counties of Nottingham, Lincoln, Rutland, Derby, Stafford,
Leicester, Warwick, Northampton, Huntington, Cambridge, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Essex, and Hertford, One of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council.
Right Honorable,
I Make bold in all humbleness to present this Treatise to your Honors
acceptance; the candid construction which your excellence has often been
pleased to give of my Sermons delivered to the Ear, has encouraged me, by a
bold tender, to offer this to your judicious Eye: If it obtain your Lordships
approbation, it will not repent me that I have exposed it to the critical View
of this censorious age, by so open a Publication; your Countenance it begges,
that your Greatness may protect it; And daigne Noble Lord, to vouchsafe it
your Honorable Patronage, for it justifies that cause with the Pen, which your
Excellence maintains with the Sword; it pleades for Loialty, and to whom can a
Treatise of Loialty in these Parts more fitly make it is address for shelter,
then unto his Excellence William Earl of Newcastle; who as one of our David's
most excellent Worthies, has approved himself a most Renowned, Heroic,
Magnanimous protector of Loialty in these Northern Counties, to the perpetual
Honor of his Name, and Noble Family. Go on still (most Noble Lord) with
Heroic Magnanimity, and prosper; till all the Kings Enemies that have risen up
against Him, be clothed with shame, and my Lord the King return home to His
Palace at White Hall in Peace; Which is the Loyal, the earnest Prayer of

Your Excellencies in all humble Observance, Service, and Duty, Y. A.

A Vulgar or Popular Discourse, Written Dialoguewise, By Irenaeus A Lover of
Peace, against Eristes A Lover of Contention.
IRenaeus, Why do you fill the Church with Schism, and the State with Faction,
can you tell Eristes? what is it you contend for? or what warrant have you to
lift up your hands against your Lawful Sovereign, the Lords Anointed?


Eristes. Are you a Stranger Irenaeus, in this our Israel, and know not these
things? the m^tters for which we contend, are m^tter^ of importance: for we
take up Arms in defense of the true Protestant Religion, His Majesty's Person,
the Liberties of the Kingdom, the Privileges of Parliament, and that by
Warrant and Commission from the two Houses of Parliament.


Irenaeus. Surely Eristes you mean to put a gull upon me, as you have done
upon many others, and by these fait plausible Pretenses would seduce me to take
part with you in a wretched Quarrel, and to hazard my Life in this World, and
my Soul in the next, by bearing Arms against my Sovereign.


Eristes. What do you hold it an unlawful and damnable act, to take up Arms
against your Sovereign, in Defense of the true Protestant Religion, His
Majesty's Sacred Person, the Laws of the Land, the Libertyes of the Subject,
and the undoubted Privileges of Parliament?


Irenaeus. First, you take for granted that which will be denied, and go about
to render your Prince odious to His People, under the hateful notion of a
Tyrant, as if he meant to subvert the true Protestant Religion, the Laws of the
Land, etc. which are sad charges, but how groundless God and the World knows.

Secondly, were your Pretenses as true as they are specious, yet it is contrary
to the Law of God, the Doctrine of the Apostles, the perpetual Pa^ience of
Christ's Church, that Princes may be resisted by their own Subjects; this is a
Conclusion drawn no^ from Divinity, but Conspiracy, and whosoever te^ch
Resistance of the highest Power, or Supreme M^gistrate; their doctrine is
wicked, and their proofs must need^ be weak, let us hear then orderly and
distinctly, what you can allege to Justify your forcible Resistance of
Sovereignty?


Eristes. You mistake Irenaeus, we who side with the two Houses of Parliament,
do not arm our selves to fight against the King, but for the King.


Irenaeus. There are no Rebels but pretend somewhat to justify their
unlawful Acts of Rebellion: do you not take up Arms against the King, when you
oppose him by Force of Arm, and in an Hostile manner seize upon his Force,
Ammunition, Ships, Revenues, when you make a General of your own, and give him
Power to Kill and Murder the Persons, to burn and plunder the Houses of His
Liege People? when you discharge your Ordnance against Him and his Army, to the
endangering of his Sacred Person? this is a strange defense, to shoot at the
King in his own defense: I believe (if this be to defend his Person) you would
not be a King, to be so defended. Consider it well, and if this be not to take
up Arms, against the King, I seriously confess, I know not what is, nor know I
what any Rebels can do more.


Eristes. But we do it to make him a glorious King, to defend, preserve, and
maintain his true Regal Power, Honor, and Dignity, to rescue him out of the
hands of the Malignant Party, who are his greatest Enemies.


Irenaeus. You tell us that you will make him a great and glorious King whilst
you use all possible ^kill, to reduce him to extreme want and indigency, and
that you will make him to be honored at home, and feared abroa^, whilst you
endeavor by an unusual way of Remonstrancing to make him Person contemptible
to Foreign Princes, and his Government odious to his good Subjects. You set a
work seditious Sectaries and Schismatics, like so many Catalin^s, the
Firebrands of their Country, to persuade the People that what you do is to
defend, preserve, and maintain his Honor, when, as appears by the nineteen
Propositions, you intend nothing less; for to instance in some of them. Is it
for his honor to have all his Counselors and great Officers displaced for no
other fault, but because they have approved themselves most loyal and
faithful to him? Is it for his Honor, that he shall never choose any Officer
of State, but accept such as the two Houses of Parliament shall be pleased to
nominate and appoint? You would think it hard if you might not be permitted to
enterteine what Servant you would, but should have them appointed and thrust
upon you by another man. Is it for his Honor to have the power of disposing
the Militia taken from him, which all other Kings his Predecessors ever had,
and enjoyed as the chiefest Prerogative and Flower of their Crowns, and which
if once he be divested of, he can neither defend himself nor his Prerogatives
Royal, nor the Laws of the L^nd in their true vigor, nor his Loyal Subject
in their Rights, Properties, and Libertyes, all which he is entrusted with; nor
overawe and suppress any of his Subjects if they should rebel, nor be able
to protect his Kingdoms against a Foreign Prince or Potentate, in case they
should invade his Dominions, Is this for his Honor? Judge as you would be
judged, and do as you would be done unto.

Lastly, whereas you pretend that you take up Arms, to rescue his Majesty out
of the hands of the Malignant Party his greatest Enemies, we know no Malign^nt
Party within this Kingdom, in all probability able to do mischief besides the
Separatists, Men notoriously disaffected to all Government, Disturbers of the
Churches Peace, and experimentally known to be fatal to Monarchy; these and
such as these His Majesty's truly defines to be the Malignant Party, who are
Persons disaffected to the Peace and Government of the Kingdom (such as
neglecting and despising the Law of the Land) give themselves other Rules to
walk by, dispencing with their obedience to Authority, and these His Majesty
heedfully avoids as Malignants destructive to the Church and Commonwealth.

But you would have them removed from the King, as wicked Malignants, w^om in
his greatest afflictions he has found most faithful and trusty, and of whose
tried Loyalty, he has had good proof and experience, and it is your usual
manner, to empty the very sinck of Language upon the reverend Fathers of this
our Israel, and our most eminently learned Clergy, and to Martyr their names
with those opprobrious obloquies of Malignant Party, Men disaffected to Peace,
Adherents to Popery, Superstition, Idolatry, Scandalous Ministers, whereas I
doubt not but many of them will (if need require) be free of their dearest
blood in refutation of such malicious calumnyes.


Eristes. Well, to wave this point, admit that we fight not for, but against
the King, yet we do it in a good cause for the defense of the true Protestant
Religion, which is our chief inheritance.


Irenaeus. You may not do evil that good may come of it, Romans 3.4 And God is
never more dishonored, then when Religion is made a Cloak to palliate
public Rebellion, consider it well, Religion teaches thee to be subject ^o
the King, Romans 13.1. and will thou for Religion in a forcible way oppose the
King?


Eristes. Why may I not, when the King is inclined to Popery, and would subvert
the true Pro^estant Religion?


Irenaeus. Thou art a man of a very light belief (if thou can be induced to
harbor in thine heart any such conceit of so gracious and Religious a Prince:)
believe me, be that tell^ thee so, is none of the Kings friend, but one of the
Malignant p^rty, who would rob the King of the Loyal subjection and affections
of his People, which is his royal due; And to the end thou may know how much
he is wronged in the report, I refer thee to His own Declarations, wherein he
often attest^ God with fearful Imprecation, That He will inviolably conserve,
and constantly maintain the true Protestant Religion, as in His M^jesties
Speech the ninth of March, 1641. God so deal with me and mine, as all my
thoughts and intentions are upright, for the maintenance of the true Protestant
Religion: And in His Declaration to both Houses, in answer to that presented to
Him at Newmarket, M^rch 9. 1641. We do (out of the innocence of Our Souls)
wish that the judgments of Heaven might be manifested upon those who have, or
had any such design of altering Religion in the Kingdom. And in His Majesty's
Answer to the Petition which accompanied the Declaration presented to Him at
Hampton Court, December 1. 1641. We are persuaded in Our Conscience, that no
Church can be found upon the Earth that professes the true Religion with more
purity of Doctrine, then the Church of England does, which we will maintain
with constancy (while we live) in its purity and glory. And in His Declaration,
May 19. Where He desires His Actions may no longer prosper, or have a blessing
from God upon them or Him, then they shall be directed to the glory of God, in
the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion.


Eristes. Sed quid opus est verbis cum facta videam?

But what are words without deeds, or attested Protestations unless they be
seconded with answerable and suitable practices?


Irenaeus. If by the true Protestant Religion, you mean the Religion or
public Form of Gods worship, established by Law in the Church of England,
and sealed by the blood of many Martyrs; you cannot be ignorant, that His
Majesty conformes to it in constant practice, even beyond the strictness of
most of His Subjects, and what other way can he testify his sincere affection
to the true Protestant Religion, but only by his profession and practice.

He then that tells thee the King is inclined to Popery in his heart, either
speaks what he knows, and then he is a searcher and knower of the heart,
which is a Prerogative belonging to God alone, not communicable to any Man, or
Angel, or else he speaks what he knows not, and then he raises a causeless
slander upon the King, contrary to his frequent Protestations and practice
which is an high crime of a dangerous consequence, that deserves the utmost
soverity of punishment.

Thou may nor bear false witness against thy neighbor of the meanest rank,
and will thou bear false witness against thy Prince? thou may nor think
ill of the King, no not in thy heart, much less should thou dare to speak
ill of him with thy tongue.

After thy Prince has often protested his zeal to Religion, and in a solemn
manner called God to witness those Protestations, and desired God to bless
him according to his true meaning therein, and his people to defend, and serve
him no longer, then he shall con^ u^ const^^ in such resolutions; will thou
still think (...) ^^y that h^ ^o^h but dissemble; good God, what is become of
charity? which binds us to believe the best of every man, (...) we have
evident proofs to the contrary.


Eristes. But the King calls in the popish party to (...) and assist him, and
is not thatan evident convincing proof that he is popishly affected?


Irenaeus. No, for first His M ^esty was very c^n^^lou^, and tender in this
point, and d^d not ad^t them of the popish party to aid and assist him in his
just c use ((...) which never Prince had juster,) till the opposite party had
admitted Papists, Brownists, men of all professions to aid and assist them in
the most causeless and unjust war that ever Subjects maintained against so
good a King, the mirror of Princes for piety, justice, and clemency.

Secondly, it cannot be denied but the Papists are His Majesty's Subjects, and
therefore stand as deeply obliged to venture their lives and fortunes in his
just defense, when they shall be required, as any of his Protestant Subjects;
otherwise their case in point of subjection were not only different, but much
better then the case of Pro estants.

Lastly, we read that David did nor refu^e the assistance of an Amalakite,
because he was an Amalakite, nor did the wounded man refuse the Samaritans wi^e
and oil because he was a Samaritane, nor did Henry the fourth the l^te French
King, while he was yet a Pro^estan^, refuse the assist^nce of those many French
Papist, w^o spent their blood in ass^rting ^i^ Crown; ^or do the united
Provi^ces reject ^he uxiliary help of Popish Regim^nts, so long as they ^re
secured of their fide^^^y. A Christi^n if he hap to fall into a deep^pit, will
not (I suppose,) refuse the aid of a Turk to help^ him out, le^st p^rchance^^
p^rish before a Christian come by that way; a sick p^tient will not refuse to
take Physic of a Jew or Papist, because he is a Jew or Papist, and I know no
reason either in Law or just Policy, why if His Majesty should be deserted of
the Puritans, He should refuse the aid of the Papists to defend His just
righ^; it is the action that justifies or condemns the person, it is not the
person that justifies or condemns the action, and if the Papists do what
befits their duty to their Sovereign, they shall rise up in judgment against
those that undutifully oppose their Sovereign. Yet I am very confident had not
the adverse party led the way, by admitting a number of P^pists, both English,
French, and of other Nations to assist them, His Majesty would never have
admitted of their assistance, unless extreme necessity should have urged him
thereto. And I am as verily persuaded that His M^jesties constant intention,
and the aims of all, by much the gr^a^test p^^ of all the Nobility, Gentry,
Clergy and others about the K^^g, that show themselves in thi^ c^u^e for him,
is not to ^lte^ the Protestant Religion established in this Church (...) to
preserve it inviol^ble from the innov^tions of ^ll ^^^^^^aticall and factious
Spirits, and to main^^in^ u^ (...) blessed primitive uniformity of Doctrine,
Discipl^in^, and Liturgy, which so long has been the glory of ou^^ and Envy of
other Churches.


Eristes. But the two Houses of Parli^men^ h^^ ^eclared our Wars to be
Lawful, and whatso^ver they by their Declarative Votes do declare and
determine to be lawful, that we must account Law, else of necessity we shall
run to confusion?


Irenaeu^. If whatsoever they declare, is to be admitted as a Law, then either
because they find it so in the Common, or Statute Law, or else merely because
they declare it, not the latter, for

First, they being but men of fallible judgments, it is possible they may be
deceived in their Declarations, and Declare that to be ri^^t which is wrong,
that to be Law which is lawless, exc^pt they will suffer their declarative
Votes to be regulated and warranted by some certain known Law formerly ^^tant
and approved.

Secondly, if their declarative Votes be Law, merely because they declare them
to be so, and we are bound to be governed by them, then the government
depending upon such Votes, must need^ be arbitrary, for wh^t can be more
arbitrary then to sit whilst they list, and to vote for Law what they list, can
there be a more absolu^e power and government according to bare will, then to
determine right or wrong, as they shall please to call it? should we the
freeborn Subjects of England, submit to this new devised way of government by
Votes, and Ordinances which no body ever he^rd of, or could k^ow before they
were voted? we should be in worse condition then Turkish slaves, whilst they
are at the mercy of one, we at the pleasure and comm^nd of hundreds, to dispose
of our Lives, Liberties, Est^tes, and whatsoever else we may call ours,
according to their humors, or free Votes bounded by no Law, but that of Sic
volumus.

Yea we should have no foundation of any Laws but their will, before which, all
Statute^, Records, Judgments, Customs, Laws whatsoever, must vanish away, if
they say that it is for the ho^our of the King, by all possible means to make
him odious to his people, then that is the Law: if they say that the taking away
of his Ships, Forts, M^g^zines, Money, Ammunition, is for his defense? then
that is the Law: if they say that all who are ready to venture their lives and
fortunes for the King, are Tr ytors, t^en that's the Law: if they say it is for
the Liberty of the Subject, to imprison him without law, for his immunity and
propriety, to lay violent hands upon his person, and to plu^der hi^ Goods, then
that's the Law: if they say it is a privilege of Parliament to deny all but
themselves freedom of Voting, then that is the Law: if they vote that there are
no Tumults, when a multitud^ of people gather themselves together before the
King^ Court in a tumultuous way, then that is the Law: if they say they have no
by-ends of their own, when they would advance themselves into all places of
Honor or profit in Court, City, Count^y, then that is the Law; and so all
Laws, all Privileges whatsoever, must be resolved into this Supreme Law,
their Wills. And can there be any Government imagined more arbitrary then this.

If it were a sin in one t^ l^bour to i^troduce such a form and manner of
Government amo^^st us; E. S.
how it can be tolerable in many ^o pr^ctise it, I do ^o^ yet understand, when
the doing of a thing i^ more then the laboring or attempting to do it. The
Apostle ^^th a cutting question, and I wish some whom it nearly concerns
would apply it. Thou that conde^^ another and do the same thing, think
thou this, that thou shall escape the judgment of God. Romans 2.3. Thou that
condemnest one for a^tempting to bring in an Arbitrary Governme^, and do thy
self actually introduce it, how c^^st thou look to escape the like judgment,
which thy own tongue has pronounced to be just?

Secondly, if such an unerring and boundless power, do lawfully and of right
belong unto both Houses of Parliament, that their m^ere Declaration can make
that to be a binding Law without appeal, which they declare to be Law; I
wonder they were so unwise, as not to challenge it before, or that they found
it out no sooner, it would (as one wittily observes) have spared the trouble of
getting the Kings assent to many Bills. Why was not Strafford killed with an
Ordinance? the Bishop discharged out of the Lord House with an Ordinance? this
Parliament made everlasting by an Ordinance? What du^l unle^rned men (as he
goes on) were Sir Edward Cook, Phillips, Elliot, Digges, etc. that could never
find or devise this knack of forging new Laws in former Parli^ments?

Fourthly, were it Law whatso^ver the two Houses declared, then could they
enact new Laws without the King, and so the well tempered, and admirably
balanced Government of this Kingdom, wherein all the three Estates are
sh^rers after a sort, and in the r^ine order, might at the pleasure only of two
of them be dissolved. But it is not equal that two of the Estates, should
judge by no Rule s^ve their own Votes, or that they should be allowed, to be
the sole arbitrary Judges both of Justice and Policy without the third: this
must of necessity make the third to stand for a Cyp^er. That the two Houses are
distinct parts of the Parli^ment is acknowledged; but that they have the power
of the whole in right (though it has been executed upon us in fact) must be
denied, unless we will grant that they can make an Act of Parliament without
the King.

In former Ages, and ever since Parliaments were in use (if I be not
misinformed, for I am no studied Lawyer) the Jus Statutorium or Statutory
Laws, were constituta, settled and established by the King and both Houses of
Parliament, in which the reasons of making those Laws, were most in the
deb^ting and voting of both House^, and the Roy^ll Assent to them was left to
the King, with a Le Roy veult, or his dissenting from them, not peremp ory, but
with a modest answer Le Roy s'avisera, which modest diss^nt was of sufficient
authority to make a Bill of both Houses invalid. And how the King has lost
that right, and what new Laws are found out destructive to that Prerogative, I
never yet re^d, nor ever shall, unless some new Ordinance or bare Vote, can
pretend to such an unwarrantable po^er.

Fifthly, if their b^re Votes, be more binding, and of greater Authority then
the King Proclam^tions, then are their words above the Kings, and their power
and authority above His, and not His above theirs, and then Saint Peter was
mistaken in telling u^ that the King is Supreme, 1. Pet. 2.13. And we are all
forsworn in taking the oath of Supremacy to the King, and no^ unto them, and
so are they, for it was enacted, Anno 5, Eliz. That every Knight, Citizen, and
Bur^esse^ in Parliament should take the same oath, and unless they took it,
they should not be admitted Parliament men, or have any voice there.

Either then the House of Commons has taken it, or not (if they have not taken
it) they are not Parliament men, nor have any voice (if they have taken it)
unless they will forswe^re themselves and deny God, they must continu^
subjects sitting in the Parliament House, and be under the King as supr^^me,
and ^onsequently, either their word^, nor au^^^rity c^n be ^bove Hi^, nor can
they Enact any Law wi^^ ^^u^ H^^ ^ssent.

But s^condly, If they pretend the form^r, That they have an Exp^^sse Law to
w^rr^nt all t^^ir D^cl^^ations, Votes, and O d^^^nce^ to be ^egall, they do^
v^^y ^ll t^^t they do not sh w ^^ unto the King, w^o pro^^ss^th, t^^t the very
sh^wi^^^ o^^^, should sati^fi^^ him an^ ^^at he ^^nnot be s^ti^fi^^ till they
she^ ^y; will t^^y (rather then show such a L^w) disp^^^se t^^ King, hazard
t^eir Religion, the Peace of the Kingdom, and the Lives and Soule^ of many in a
bloody Watre?

Briefly, Either th^r^i^ such a Law, and they will end^nger King, Kingdom,
Lives, Goo^, Religion, b^ a B^oody, Civil, Destructive, unnatur^ll War,
r^ther t^en show it, which would argue them extremely uncharit^bl^; or else
indeed there is no such Law for them t^ declare, and then their D^cl^r^tions
are not Legal, and by consequence we are not bound to obey them.

I will conclude this point with some Observable passages out of His Majesty's
Answers to the Declarations and Remonstrance of the two Houses of Parliament,
(...) first out of that Answer of His to the Declara^ion of both Houses
touching the Militia, wherein they pretend that they were necessitated, to m^ke
such an Or^inance for settling the Militia, warranted thereunto by the
Fundamental Laws of the Land.

They may do well (says His Majesty) to tell Our good Su^jects what those
Fundamental Laws of the Land are, and where to be found, and to mention one
Ordinance from the first beginning of Parliaments to this present Parliament,
which endeavored to impose an^ thing upon the Subject without the Kings
Consent, for of such all the inquiry that We can make could never produce Us
one instance, and if there be such a secret of the Law which has lain hidden
from the beginning of the World to this time, and now is discovered to take
away the just legal Power of the King, We wish that there be not some other
secret (to be discovered when they please) for the Ruin and destruction of the
Liberty of the Subject: for no doubt if the Votes of both Houses have any such
authority to make a new Law, it has the same autho^ity to repeal the old.
Then what will become of the long established Rights and Liberties of the King
and Subject, and particula^ly o^ Magna Charta, will be easily discerned by the
most ordinary understanding.

Secondly, out of His Majesty's Answer to the Declaration of both Houses
concerning Hull, May 4. 1642. The power of Parliaments is great and unlimited,
but it is on^y in that sense, as we are a part of the Parliament, wit^o^t V^,
or against Our Consent, the Votes of either, or both H^^^es together must not,
cannot, shall not (if We can help it for Our Subjects sake as well as Our Own)
forbid any thing that is enjoined by the Law, or enjoyne any thing that is
forbidden by the Law

In what a miserable insecurity and confusion must we necessary and inevitably
be, if the Sovereign Legal Authority may be despised by Votes, or Orders of
either, or both Houses.

Thirdly, Out of His Majesty's Answer to a Book Entitled, The Remem^rance of
the Lords and Commons, May 19. 1642.

There cannot be imagined a greater Violation of our Privileges, the L^w of
the Land the Liberty of the Subject, and the Right of Parliament, then the
Votes past in the House, March 15.16. One of which Votes was (and there need no
other to destroy both King and People) That when the Lords and Commons shall
declare that the Law of the Land is, the same must be assented u^ to and
obeyed; that is the Sense in f^w words, Where is every Man's Property? Every
Man's Liberty? If the major part of bothh Houses declare, that the Law is, the
younger Brother shall inherit, what is become of all the Families and Estates
in the Kingdom? (...) they Declare, that by the Fundamental Law of the Land,
such a ra^ a (...) unadvised Wo^d, ought to be punished by perpetuaal (...), is
no^ the Liberty of the Subje^, dur^nte been (...) dilesse?

1. They Vote the Kingdom is in di^e the (...) Vote that by the Fundamental
Law of the Land the ordering of the Militia must be left to their disposal.

2. They Vote, That the King intends to levy War againt His Parliament, and
then they Declare, That whosoever shall assist Him, is guilty of high Treason.

We admonish both Houses of Parliament to take heed of enclining under the
specious she^s o^ necessity and danger, to the exercise of such an Arbitrary
power they before complained of, the advice will do no harm, and We shall be
glad to see it followed.


Eristes. But Our Libertyes and Estates are entrenched upon, and We must not be
so basely degenerous, a^ to suffer them to be betrayed, but we are bound to
defend our lawful L^ber^ies and Estates even against the King himself, which
we inherit, as truly from our Ancestors, as the King inherits any thing he
has.


Irenaeus. What has the King denied which concerns our Liberties, and are the
undoubted securityes of our safety, freedom, and happiness under the Regiment
of a just and unquestionable Monarchy?

Are not our Rights and Propertyes already established this Parliament, by such
Acts of Grace as could never find Presidents from his Ancestour^? are not
Monopolies upon what pretenses soever, Proj^^ts, all illegal Taxes, t^ose
arbitrary Courts of Justice, High Commission, Star Chamber, Marshalseyes, and^.
^^erly ^^m^'d and ex^irpated; and does not His Majesty in His Message to both
Houses March 1. 1643. move them, That they would with all speed fall into a
serious consideration of those particulars; which they should hold necessary
for the present and future establishment of their Privileges, the free and
quiet enjoying of their Estates and fortunes, and the Liberties of their
Persons. And in His Majesty's Answer to the Person of the Commons, Jan. 18.
1641. does he not call God to witness, That the preservation of the Law and
Liberty of the Subject, is, and shall always be as much His Majesty's care and
Industry, as his Life and the lives of His dearest Children. And in His
Majestyes Speech to the Committee, March the ninth 1641. does he not thus
pass^^n^^ely exp^^st^^^te with them. What would you have? ^^ve I de^^ed to
pass any Bill for the ease and Security of (...) Subje^^s; there is a
judgment from Heaven upon this Kingdom, if these Distractions continue. God so
deal with me and mine, as all my thoughts and intentions are upright, for the
preservation of the Laws of the Land.

And are not these pledges sufficient to dissolve all jealousies, if ever we
mean^ to be sa^ti^fied, and to ^ssure us that we may live safe and fr^e under
the Government of so just, gracious and Religious a Prince^ if working he^ds
(quibus quieta movere magna est merc^s) ^^o love to sish in troubled waters,
and think the dist^^b^nce of the public Peace a sufficient hire to set them
on work.) did not purposely for their own advantage, and by-ends, labor to
cast the mist of causeless fears and jealousies, before the People merely to
startle them into a posture of war, As that printed relation of the Tailors
in Moorefield, of the Stable of horses under ground, of the D^nish Fleet, that
was discomfited by Van Trump long since; besides other strange horrid
treasonable discoveryes, and Letters which came God knows from whence? that
were purposely feigned and devised, to hinder a right understanding between the
King and his People, and to embroyle the Kindome in a Civil War.

Whereas we feel to our just grief, and hope we may truly affirm, withour
danger of being branded with the black Stigmaticall name of Malignants, that
there was nothing formerly suff^red by us, the free borne Subjects of this
Land; which has not upon the same pretenses, but with less color been since
acted and exceeded by those who were called together to ease us of the like
sufferings, for our Estates have been taken away without our consent, in
defense of our Property; our Persons have been imprisoned without just cause,
in defense of our Libertyes; and our condition (as one observes at this
present, is so far from being bettered, that it is grown extremely worse, as
if all the evils of former times, had been Epitomized into the volume of two
ye^res last past; and the Quintissence of ours and the former Ages grievances
had been extracted, and given us at one draught. See the Complaint to the House
of Commons


Eristes. But may not the two Houses of Parliament who are the representative
body of the Kingdom, summon and authorize all the able freeborn Subjects of the
Land, to take up Arms against the King in maintenance of them and their
Privileges when they are deserted, and their Priledges infringed by the King,
which is just the case of the two Houses of Parliament at this present.


Irenaeus. First the King has not deserted His Parliament, but was forced to
leave His Palace at White Hall, and to take shelter elsewhere, because His
sacred Person could not there be safe, from the danger-threatning uproares, and
^umults of a heady misguided, masterlesse multitude, and it was not fit to m^ke
Majesty so cheap, and despicable, as to expose it to the base and barbarous
affronts of a sedit ou^ huddle.

Secon^ly, so far is His Majesty from infringing any just or undoubted
Privilege of Parliament, that in his answer to a Book entitled a Remonstran
e of the Lords and Commons May 19. 1642. He desires his actions may no longer
prosper, then they shall be directed, to the maintenance of all the Rights, and
freedom of Parliament, in the allowance and protection of all their just
Privileges.

And let the two Houses of Parliament exhibit a list of the Privileges, not
only belong^ng to the being and efficacy of P^rliaments, but to the honor also
and complement of them, and clearly declare them to be true, just and
undoubted Privileges, and I am confident they shall have His Majesty's
allowance and approbation; ^ea I d^re be bold to say, they shall have
observ^nce al^o, from those that are nicknamed Malignants; but till ^^ey be
declared by them, how can they b^ observe^ ^^y u^ reason ought to be sati fied,
before obe^ience may be expected, especially in point^ of such high
^o^ce^^ment, wherein our Laws, Liberties, Estates, yea even our very souls are
interessed, and though we be falsely Christened the Popish Army, for
discharging our Loyalty and duty to our Sovereign; yet thu^ far at least we
are Pro^^stants, that we will not resign up our underst^ndings to t^eir
infallibility; and in a Popish way yield blind obedience to all their Votes,
before we know them to be just and legal, which we have more reason now to
suspect then ever.

First because the two Houses of Parliament now sitting have disclaimed the
legal way of proceeding in former Parliaments, according to the wa ranted rule
of the Law, beside that which is recorded in their own breasts.

2. Because we see that a number the far greater number of approved able men,
whose Ability, Wisdom, Moderation, Judgment, and Sufficiency, were the only
inducement of their Countries Elections, have withdrawn themselves, as
unusefull Members of that Body, out of a dislike of such disorderly
unwarrantable proceedings, and for that they were debarred of those two grand
Privileges, which conduce to the very being of Parliaments, viz. Liberty of
Speech, and Liberty of Access, that they could neither freely come, nor freely
Vote, being from without menaced, affronted, assaulted by the Rabble, and
within censured, fined imprisoned, or banished for discharging their duty to
God, their King, and Country, by such of their own Fellow Members, who make
wit, and the Kings favor, heinous crimes; Loyalty, Treason; and Conformity,
Popery.


Eristes. But they are the representative body of the Kingdom, and we whom they
represent are bound to be in a readiness upon their summons, to secure their
actions from neglect and contempt.


Irenae^^. Suppose one whom we Elect a Burgess of Parliament, or a Knight of
the Shire speak, or endeavor to enact Treason, does our Election bind us to
secure him? or will future Parliaments blam^ us hereafter for giving up so
great a Delinquent to the Justice of the Law? I presume they will not.

The Commons do not represent the People in any thing which the Law has not
trusted to them; but neither the Law of God, nor the Law of Nature, nor the Law
of the Land have trusted the Subject with the Sword, or with a power of making
War against their Sovereign, in whose name, and by whose authority only the
Sword is to be drawn; therefore if the representative body attempt any such law
less, and unlawful Act, we may not second or abet them in it, but must
mainely oppose them to the utmost of our power.

Non tribuamus dandi regni atque imperii potestatem nisi Deo vero, qui dat
regnum caelorum solis p^is regnum vero terre^um and pei^ and impiis sicut ei
placet, cui nihil injuste placet. Aug. de Civit. Dei, lib. 5. cap. 21.

Et paulo post qui Mario, ipse Caio Ca^^ari qui Augu^ o ^^se and. Neroni etc.
regnum dedit,


First the Law of God, that teaches us to fear God and the King, and nor to
fight against Him, Prove. 24.21.30.31. And it tells us, That all who live under
a Monarchical Regiment, ought to submit unto the King as Supreme, 1 Pet.
2.13. And ^t puts no difference between good and bad Princes in point of
subjection, for, God (says Saint Augustine) that gave the Empire to Augustus,
a mild and gracious Prince, gave it to Nero, a very monster of men, He that
gave it ^o Constantine, a most worthy Christian Emperou^, gave it to Julian a
most damnable Apostata; And be the Magistrate Jew or Gentile, Christian or
Heathen, good or bad, he has his authority of Government from God, the
supreme Moderator and Governor of the whole World. In respect whereof we are
bound for Conscience sake toward God to be subject unto him.

Must Masters be submitted unto notwithstanding their curstinesse? 1 Pet. 2.18.
And may Princes be oppugned it too sharp?) Israel rose not against David in
the cause of Vriah, nor against Solomon in a worse c^use, Idolatry; nor against
Saul, though a Murdering and Massacring King. All the Kings of Israel were open
Idolaters, Jehu not excepted, and the greater p^t of the Kings of Judah,
fourt^en of them were likewis^ pl ^n Idolaters, yet no Priest or Prophet taught
the People to r^sist one of them.

God has expresse^y comm^n^ed all Inferiors to be subject to the Sup^ri^ur
M^gistr^te. Now subordinate M^gistrate, th^ng^ they be Sup^riour to ot^ers; yet
in a Monarchy the^ are ^ll inferior to the King; for as in Logic, that Ge^u^
which is c^lled s^^alte^num, though it be Genu^ in resp^ct of those S^e ^^s
t^^t ^r^ (...) ^er it, ^et in regard of the Genu^ ^bove, i^ is but a Species.
Ev^n so Subordinate M^gistrates what p^^ce soever ^^ey ^o^d in rel^tion to
their inf^ri^u, in respect to their Sover^igne they are but mere Subjects, and
owe subj^ction to Him a^ far ^s any other, and no Ear^^ly Court can l^cense
inferiors of what rank or quality soever, to violate or frusta^e that Heavenly
precept which commands them to be subject to their Superior. Romans 13.1. and
not to resist Him, ve^s. 4.

Be the Cause never so just (if the Person be not authorized by God to dr^w the
sword) they be no just and lawful Wars, but barb^rous and rebellious
upro^res. For say when Malefactors are put to death, may private men put them
to death without the Magistrate? certainly they may not, and if they do, be
they not Murderers) though the crime which they revenge be worthy of death)
doubtless they be, then if in private punishments men may not presume without
his aut^ority that bears the Sword, much less may they venture upon open
Wars, except they be directly warranted from him that has the sword from
God, to take vengeance on the wicked; least of all may they bear Arms against
their Sovereign. Princes they bear the sword over others, not others over
them, Subjects may be punished by them, they by none but God whose place they
supply.

And as the Law of God does not trust Subjects with the sword against their
Sovereign, no more does the law of Nature: for though the law of Nature
teaches us to defend our selves from violence and wrong, (as Borough^ objects)
though it be the most natural thing in the world, for every thing to preserve
it self; natural for a man to preserve himself, natural for a community (as
Bridges alleges to justify the Lawfullnesse of that War which the two
Houses of Parliament sitting, have raised and levied against the King:) yet by
the dictate^ of nature, neither Man not Communities of men are taught to defend
and pres^rve themselves in a disorderly, and unnatural way; now it is against
Order, and a Monster in nature and policy, for a Child to chastize his Father,
for a S^rv^nt to punish his Master, for a Soldier to fight against his
General, Colonel, or Captain, no less disorderly and unnatural is it for a
Subject to fight against his Sovereign, who is Parens ^atriae the Father of
the Commonwealth: he that faith the Law of Nature gives power to Inferiors
over or against their Superiors, though for self preservation is fitter to be
purged from Frenzy, then answered by Divinity.

If the case were so that either the Parent must kill the Child, or the Child
the Father, no man, I suppose, in his right wits, but would think it becomes
the Child, who has his being from his Father, rather to suffer, then to
destroy the Fountain whence he originally sprang; and yet Parents have not so
great power over their Children, as Kings over their Subjects. Kings have power
of Life and Death, which Parents have not; and the M^sters power over his
servants, is less then the power of Parents over their Children.

Lastly, Neither does the Law of the Land entrust Subjects with the Sword
against their Sovereign, for by the Law of the Land, all we that be Subjects,
above the age of eighteen years, are bound to swear Allegiance to our
Sovereign Lord the King. There was an O th enacted, Anno 3, Jacobi, wherein ^e
that t ke^ it swe^re^, That he will bear Faith and true Allegi^nce to His M
j^sty. H^^ He^res and Successors, etc. And Him and them will de^en^ to the
utmost of hi^ power against all Con^p^^icies and A^^mpts whatsoever, which
shall be made against H^^ or t^^r Persons, their cro^n and dignity, etc. And it
was fur^^^r enacted by Parliament, 7, Jacobi, That al^ and ^very Person and
P^^so^s, as well Ecclesi^sticall ^s C^vill, of wh^t Sta^e, Dignity, Qu^lity, or
D^gree ^o^ver ^e o^ they b^, above the age of eighteen years, in that Act
mentioned, shall take the said Oath.

And if all the Sub^ects in the Land above eighteen ye^res old, have (as by Law
they are bound) taken the s^id O^th, unless they will wittingly and willingly
forswear themselves, they must with all their power defend the Kings Person
and Dignity, and by consequence, they may not oppose either, or do such
things, as may endanger His Person, and lessen His Authority and Dignity.

Neither may they be Newters and sit still suffering others to wrong him; but
they must stand up to maintain his right, and to vindicate his wrong. And they
must defend him by purse, bodily service, or what way soever they can, else
they are forsworn.


Eristes. But may we not sometimes lawfully deny obedience to the Kings verbal
or Personal Commands.


Irenaeus. Yes in some cases it is not only lawful, but necessary to disobey
the command of the King, as when God commands one thing, and the King in a
menacing and threatening way commands another: then that Speech is seasonable.
Da veniam Imperator, tu carcerem, ille Gehennam minatur, Give leave O Emperor,
thou threatnest my body with imprisonment, but God can cast both my Soul and
Body into Hell, the worst and most darkesome Prison of all others. In such a
case we may and must neglect our duty to our Prince, rather then forget our
duty to God. Nam Regum timendorum in proprios Greges Reges in ipsos Imperium
est Jovis. For Kings though they be Superiors in regard of their Subjects, yet
are they inferior unto God. Omne sub regno graviore regnum est. Every Kingdom
on Earth is under a greater in Heaven. And the Apostolical Canon, Romans 13.1.
which wills us to be subject to the higher powers before the lower amongst men,
does by Analogy instruct us to be principally subject to that highest power, by
whom the Powers on Earth are ordained, and set in Order one above another.

When Pharaoh King of Egypt commanded the Hebrew Midwives to strangle the
Hebrew Male Children in the birth, they feared God and did not the command of
the King, Exodus 1.17. When Nebuchadnezz^r having erected a Golden Image,
commanded all people to fall down and worship it, under penalty of being cast
into the hot fiery ^^rna ^, ^hadracke, M^sech and Abednego refused to d^^ the
command of the King, because the Law of God forbad them to do it, Dan. 3.18.
When Darius had signed a Decree, That none should make any Petition to God,
save only to him for certain days; Daniel, notwithstanding the Decree, went
into his House, and his Chamber Windows ^eing opened toward J^rusalem,
kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed to his God, contrary to
the signed Decree, and exp^esse command of the King, Dan. 6.10. The seven
Brethren, though Antiochus Epiphanes, or rather Epimanes, threatened to torment
them with scourges and whippes, yet they would not, by all the threatenings and
exquisite torment^ that ^e could use, be compelled to taste of Swine flesh,
because it was against the Law of their God, 1 Ma^ab. 7.1. And Julians
Christian Soldiers though they readily sought his B^ttells, and obeyed him
when he commanded things lawful; yet, Quando veniebatur ad causam Christi, Aug
in Psa. 124.
non ag^ os^ebant nisi illum qui in Caelo erat, quando volebat, ut Idola
colerent, aut thurificarent, praeponebant illi Deum; When they came to the
cause of Christ, they would acknowledge no Lord but him that is in Heaven, when
he commanded them to worship Idols, ^o sacrifice and burn I^cense to his
Idol gods, they preferred God before their Prince. And the case was clearly
resolved long since by the Apostles, That when the Kings command c^osseth the
command of God, then it is absolutely better for us to obey God than man, Acts
5.29. Yet here we must take heed, first that we be not led by fancies, and
groundless imaginations, but be sure that what the King commands, is against
Gods Law.

Secondly, That denying obedience, we do it in all humility, without scandal
and contempt.

Thirdly, That yet we be content to obey passively, without resisting the
higher power.

For, even then, when we cannot with a safe Conscience obey the command of the
King, because we have received a cou^ter-command from God, we must be subject
to him notwithstanding, and not dare to rise up against him, Nam qui i^s^rgit
in Ch^istum Domini, Psalm. 2.1.
insurgit in Dominum Christi, For he that rises up against the Lord Anointed,
rises up against the Lord by whom he was Anointed. The least Injury, Numb.
16.11 1 Samuel 8.7.
Indignity, Affront of Disgrace that is done to the King, whom God has
appointed his immediate Deputy and Vicegerent on Earth, to Rule and Govern in
his place, does in the reflex, extend and redound ^o God himself, the Author
of all Rule and Government, and by consequence, it must needs be an heinous and
hateful sin in the sight of God, for Subjects to rise up against their
Sovereign, though a Nero, a bloody persecuter of the Faith, much more against
a Charles, a gracious Defender of the Faith.

Amb. lib 3. epist. 33.
S^int Am^rose highly commended the people of Mill^in, when there was hot
persecution in the City, for the V^yce they then used, Rogamus Auguste, non
pugnamus, We om^^nt, O Emperor, we sight not, perhaps you will say, they durst
not; yes, Non ti^emus, and tamen rogamus; We se^^ not the Emperors Forces, yet
we entreat. The like Spe^ch S^int Bernard uses in an Epistle of his to Lewis
the French King, Stabimus, and pugnahimus usque ad mortem (si ita o^o^tuerit)
pro matre nostra Ecclesia, Bern. Epist. 221.
sed Armis quibu^ licet, non scutis and gladiis, sed precibus, fletibusque ad
Deu^, We will stand and sight for our Mother the Church (if need be unto death)
with such Arms and Weapon^ as lawfully we may, not with Sword and Tar^et, but
with Prayers and Tears unto God. Tertul. Apol. cap. 37.
And Ter^ (...) in his Apologetick tells u^, That the Ancient Chur^hes (...)
time, when they had Heathen and Pers^^^ng Emp^^^rs to rule over them, yet they
choose rather to suffer, then to ^^ke ^^s^stance by force of Arms, though they
lacked neither (...) strength to withstand the Emperors Forces.

And that the doctrine of resisting Pri^^^ (...) taught by the ancient Father,
you shall he (...) ^onsi^^^ly averred by some Learned Divine: of our C^u^ch who
were best seen and verst in their Writings; No O^tho^o^ Father did by Word or
Writing (...) resis^ (...) for the space of a thousand years after Christ,
^e^l^^^ (...) cap. 19. Sect. 19. The worthy Fathers and Bishop^ of the Church,
persuaded themselves that they owed all duty ^o Kings, though Infidels and
Heretics, Field, lib. 5. cap. 45. The Doctrine which teaches resistance of
Prince^ is wicked, having neither Scripture, Council, nor Father which avowed
it for a thousand years. Bilsons true diff^ren^^ between Christian Subjection,
and Unchristian R^bellion part 3. in whom we often meet with these or the like
pa^sages. Whether Princes be with God or against God; either we must obey their
Commandment, or abide the ^^nishment (if we will be Subjects.)

Princes must be obeyed, or endured; Either obedien^^ to their Wills, or
submission to the Sword is due by Go^ Law.

God is not served with resisting the Sword, but with dutiful obedience to
Magistrate^, when their commands agr^^ with his, and in case their Wills be
dissonant from his, th^^ is he served with meekness and readiness to bear
(...) abide that which earthly powers shall inflict, this was the cause why the
Church of Christ always rejoiced in the Blood of their Martyrs, patiently
suffering the cruel rage, both of Pagans and Arrians, and never favored any
tumults of Rebels assembling themselves to withstand authority.

That conceit then of Bridges is fond, foolish, and unwarrantable, who thinks
that many Christian Martyrs in the Primitive Church, would so far have
resisted the Roman Emperors, that they would have saved their own Lives, if
the Senate of Rome, or the People of the Roman Empire would have joined with
them. Tertullian disclaimed this fancy with an absit? God forbid that we
Christians should defend our selves against our Emperors by humane force.
There can be no War made against us; but we are fit and sufficient for it (if
we would seek revenge of our persecutors) but our Christian discipline and
profession is rather to be slain, then to slay, Tertul, Apologet, cap. 37.
Saint Cyprian expresses the same Christian profession, Cyprian ad Demetriad.
nos laesos divina ultio desendet, inde est quod nemo nostrum, se adversus
injustam violentiam, quamvis nimius and copiosus, sit noster populus
ulciscatur; We leave vengeance to God, and hence it is that none of us do seek
to revenge our selves against unjust violence, although our number be exceeding
great, more then the number of our persecutors.


Erisles. But what if the Kingdom see it self in imminent danger, most likely
to be ruinated by the King and His Cavaliers, may it not stand up to defend it
self by force of Arms? Is not Salus Populi Suprema Lex? The safety of the
People the Supreme Law? The preservation of the Kingdom and of the Religion,
Laws and Liberties thereof, to be preferred before subjection to the King?


Irenaeus. First, God be thanked, that is not our case, for as that Gentleman
of quality who wrote the Review of the Observations upon some of His Majesty's
late Answers and Expresses, well Observes; No King of this Realm has granted
more for the good, ease, benefit, and behoof of His Subjects, then His Majesty
has done, had we thankful hearts to acknowledge it, witness His damming of
Ship Money, Monopolies, etc. And His yielding to the regulation of whatsoever
further grievance should be found in the Commonwealth.

What more gracious motion could be made by a Prince to His People, then that
which His Majesty made in His Message to both Houses of Parliament, Ian. 20.
1641. Wherein He moved them with all speed to fall into a serious considerations
of these (...), which they should hold necessary for the present and future
establishment of their Privi^e^es, the free and quiet enjoying of their Estates
and fortunes, the Liberties of their (...) the security of the true Religion
now professed in the Church of England, and the settling (...) Ceremonies, in
such a d^s ent a^ c^ly manner, as might take away all just o^ offense. Is this
the gr^tious motion of a King, that intends the ruin and subversion of His
Kingdom? God be Judge between Him and them, that would fasten so false an^
foul an aspersion upon a Prince unparalelled for clemency and piety.

Secondly, Though the King should in a Violent, and Tyrannical way go about
to oppress His People, though really and truly there were such dangers
threatened both to the Church and State (as is pretended;) yet unlawful means
(such as is resisting the Supreme Magistrate in a free Monarchy) to defend our
selves from unjust violence and oppression ought not to be used. Suffering is
commanded and commended unto us in the Scripture, resisting is forbidden, Romans
13.2. Our Savior foreshewing his Disciples that they should be brought before
Kings and Rulers, and be cruelly entreated, says not, and he that first
Rebels, but he that endures to the end shall be saved, Mat. 10. And again,
not with violence resist them, but in patience possess your Soul, Luke 21.
This is the way for all Christian Subjects to conquer Tyrants, not to resist
the Supreme Power though Tyrannically abused, least we be damned, but rather to
suffer that we may be Crowned. When either we cannot escape by flight, or abate
and stop the fury of Tyrants, by our Tears and Prayers to God. The Ancient
Fathers allowed no other Weapons to Christian Subjects against persecuting
Tyrants; but only these four, Preces, and Lachrymas, patientiam, and sugam.
Prayers, and Tears, Patience, and Flight.


And it is observed by the Learned, that the Churches never more flourished
then in the Primitive times, when they used these defensive Weapons only, Vide
Field l. ^0. c. 45.
reserving vengeance unto God, to whom only it belongs to take order with
wicked Kings, since he alone is above them, and therefore he alone has power
to punish them. The royal dignity of Kings is so inseparably annexed to their
sacred Persons, that although they do offend in Person, yet no vindictive
power can be exercised against their persons, without violation of their Royal
Dignity, which although it be not transcendent to all Laws of Justice to be
done, yet it is transcendent to all Laws of Justice in respect of punishment
by man when Justice is not done. And in that respect David a King truly said
to God, against thee only have I sinned. Psalm. ^1.4. he had sinned against
others, yet so as none might take vengeance of him for his sin but only God.
This I am sure was the Divinity of Saint Ambrose, Chrysostom, and others of
the Ancient Fathers, Reges nullis ad paenam vo^antur legibus, tuti imperii
potestate. Kings are safely gu^rded by their Imperi^ll power, from the penalty
of hum^ne Law. Ambrose Enar^at, in Psalm. 51. Rex etsi Leges in ^otesta^^, b^^et
ut impune delinquat, Deo tamen subditus est, and su^^icit illi in ^aenam, quod
De^m expectet ultorem. A King (...) the Laws so far in His power, that He is
not puni^h (...) by them, but may br^^ke them wit^out (...), yet he is subject
to God, and it may ^uffi^^ (...) He has Go^ to take venge^^ce of him, to whos^
w^^t^^ by the ^buse of His power, He m^kes himsel^^ (...) ^^^^s^^^^m in Psalm.
118. O (...) 17. Nemo lege^ (...) Reges i^ qui^^^ preva^i^tio^^ i^ (...) enim
dect^um est impium^ (...) ag^^. None may break the Laws o^ Kin^^^^ (...)
punishm^nt, but Kings themselves, w^om (...) ^^arged with the tra^sgression of
their own Law (...) it was wi^ely s^i^, that he is an u^godly man that say
(...) King. Thou ^od wickedly. Cyrill. Eccles. 8.4.
This w then t^ugh^ ^or goo^. Di^inity by the A^cient Fathers, an^ yet they
were n^ Cour^ Para^ite^.

^astly, be it so that Salus P^^u^i s^^rema Lex, the safety of the People, is
the Sup^^m^ L^w, yet experience tells us that it is safer for a p^op^^ not to
resist, then to resist their Prince by force of Ann, for what mischief is not
Civil War accompanied with? it never comes alone, but is accompanied with
Rapine, Spoil, Robbery, Plundring, and all im^ginary evil, whereas due
subjection to the Prince, is the caus^ of tranquillity, peace, order,
prosperity, and happiness in the State, and the only way to preserve the
Commonwealth in safety.

Theopompus King of Sparta speaking to one of hi^ Domestic servants, who told
him that the Spartan affairs did prosper well, because they had Kings who knew
how to govern well; nay rather, says he, because the People know well how to
obey; imputing the long continuance and flourishing of the Spartan Sat, not so
much to the skillful Government of their Kings, as to the ready subjection and
willing obedience of the People. And so long as we demeaned our selves as
Loyal Subjects, God blessed us with abundance of Peace, and temporal
felicity, even to the envy of all other Nations round about us. But since
(some out of an humor and desire to be Subjects without subjection, have
turned disloyal to their Sovereign, and risen up in arms against Him) our
tre^sures have been exhatisted, our Lands mightily impoverished by the
expensive oppression of War, and this once flourishing Kingdom and Nation is
in danger to be brought unto utter ruin and desolation, (if God do not timely
cease these seditious Tumults and Commotions, by instilling Loyal and
Peaceable affections into the hearts of those who have occasioned or abetted
those Tumults.


Eristes. But did not the people of Israel resist Saul their King by force of
arms when they rescued Jonathan out of his hand, 1 Samuel 14.45. Did not David
take up defensive arms, when h^ gathered six hundred Soldiers together to
defend himself against the violence and fury of Saul, his Liege Lord and
Sovereign? and when, as may be supposed, he would have kept Saul out of Keilah
by forcible resistance if the Keilites would have stood to him, 1. Sam. 23.12.
Nay does not the Scripture s^y expressly that he came with the Philistines
against Sau^ to Battle, 1. Sam. 12.19. Did not Elisha the Prophet bid the
Elders of Israel use the Kings M^ssenger roughly, and hold him fast at the
door 2. Kings 6.32. Did (...) Azariah the High Priest, and four^score Priest^
o^ the Lord that were valian^ men, violently thrust King V^^^^h out of the
Temple af er he became Leprou^? 2 Cron. 26.17.20. who in that they are
commended for without Men (says Bridges) it shows that their work was not
only reproof, but resistance.

Lastly, have we nor warrantable Exampl^^ and ^^^^dents from the reformed
Churches to justify at (...) up Arms in our own defense to be lawful.


Irenaeus. To all these alleged Ex^mples I may answer in general, that we
Christians o^ght to follo^ no man's, ^o Churches example further then they
follow Christ. 1 Cor. 11.1. But Christ (...) ^^^ght us either by pr^ctise or
precept to resist the higher power; he both by Ex^mple and Precept taught the
contrary; for he left us an example of patient suffering from Aut^ority, not of
resisting Authority, 1. Pet. 2.21.23. and when Authority caused him uniustly to
be apprehended, and after condemned, he would ^o^ suffer Peter to defend ^im
against the present Aut^ority ^ith the sword: bu^ bad him put up the sword
which form^^y he h^d (...) ^wn in his defense, telling him, that he that takes
(...) sword without deputation from Authority, or against authority, though
unjustly abused, shall p^rish by the Sword, Mat. 26.52. admit then that your
Testim^nies and Ex^mples out of the old Testament did prove it in some case to
be lawful under the Law to take up defensive arms, against Persons in^ested
with Sovreaigne Power, can you show it to be lawful under the Gospel? where
suffering is commande^ and commended, rensting forbidden and condemned, and
where Christ's meek Spirit, not Eliahs revengefull spirit, is to guide us if
we would not be misguided, Luke 9.55.

But to answer your allegations more punctually, as you have no proof out of
the new, so you have none out of the old Testament to legitimate and warrant
your offensive, defensive Weapons. To begin with your first example.

Though the People were then in arms by Saul's own appointment, when they
rescued Jonathan out of his hands, yet they did not rescue him out of Saul's
hand by force of arms.


Eristes. How then did they rescue him?


Iren^eus. Not with offensive weapons but with perswasiue words, Shall Jon^than
dye (say they) who has wrought so great salvation in Israel? as the Lord
lives, there shall ^^t an hair of his head fall to the ground. Or as Junius
and Tremelius two famous Interpreters translate the words by way of
interrogation, more agreeable to the original, An tadere debet ullus e capillis
ejus? ought their to fall any hair of his head to the ground. They appeal to
Saul himself (say these learned Interpreter^) whether in Conscience he ought
it just and reasonable that Jonathan should dye by whose means they were all
then alive, charging his Conscience before God that he should rather have
resp^ct to Equity then his rash o^th. Thus then they rescued Jonathan not by
arms but by arguments, (as A^^gal did Nabal her Hu^band, and the rest of her
Household out of the hand of David, who had in like manner sworn to cut them
all off, 1 Samuel 25.) or if the People here pressed violently upon Saul in
making a mutiny, they cannot be excused, says Peter Martyr in locum, and so
the example is either imp^rtinently alleged, or else b^ing in it self
in^x^us^ble, it cannot excuse, much less just^fie your do^^g^.

Your next example o^ test^mony is as (...) to the purpose as the former, for
D^vid did not ^^st^r o^ gather fix hundred Soldiers together, they resort^d
a^^ c^^^ to him of their own accord, 1 Samuel 22.1. Neit^^r d^^ (...) m^ke us^ of
their help to defend himself against the V^o^ence a^^ Fury of Saul; but his
way of defen^e wa^ by fly^^g, and h^ding himself from Saul, not by resist^^^,
(...) opposing him. And produce, if you ^^n, one syll^^^^e (...) Sacred Story,
to show that ever David m^de offer to r^^st Saul, when he come ^o in^^de him.


Eri^tes. It i^ more then probable that he would have resisted Saul, if the men
of Keilah would have stood to him otherwise b^ing in Keilah, why did he enquire
whether Saul would come there to seek him? and he^ring that Saul would not
fail to come down, why did he further enquire whether the Keilites would
deliver him into the hand of Saul? D^e not these Q^a^^es more then prob^bly
argue, That David had a mind to r^main in Ke^^a^, and t^ defend the City
against Saul (as Sir Jo^n Hot^a^ did H^^ against His M^j^sty) would the men of
K^ilah have stu^k close to him.


Irenaeus. No finely, the r^^son in all lik^li^ood and ^ppearance, why D^vid
was thu^ solicitous to know the purpos^ of Saul, and the Keilites, was, because
^e susp^cted treacherous deceit in the men of Keil^^, That if ^e st^y^ till the
King came, they would shut the G^^^, and keep him in, till the King should come
an^ appr^^end him, and not suffe^ him to escape by s^^^^, (...) hi^ usu^ll
m^nn^r was. For he enquires of God, ^ill the ^^n of Ke^^^ deliv^^ (...)? Or as
it is in the Marginall reading of the Bible, agreeable to the Original, Will
they shut me up? Will they take advantage of the G^tes and Bars of this
walled Ci^y, and closely shut me up that I cannot have liberty to fly from Saul
when he comes? His purpose was to fly out of Keilah, and not to defend it if
Saul came; this made him careful to enquire whether the men of Keilah would
shut the Gates upon him, and so hinder him that he could not fly from Saul,
according to his wonted Custom; There is not then here the least shadow of a
proof for defensive Arms, unless we will by an improbable conjecture make
David's purp^se in this pl^ce to thwart his constan^ practice and prof^ssion in
all other places of the sacred Story, where his dutiful submissi^e b^haviour,
^umble carriage, and speeches full of Loy^ll respect toward Saul are Recorded.


E^istes. Bu^ does not the Scriptu^e in plain terms say that David went with
the Philistines against Saul to Battle? 1 Chronicles. 12.19.


Ire^ae^^. It does; yet he that will peruse the 1 Samuel 29 may there read, that
David went not to B^ttell against Saul, he only went a little way with the
Philistines that went to battle against ^im, and the Princes of the
Philisti^es had so little confidence of David's good affection to that c^use;
that they were earnest with A^hish their King to ^^d him back as a m^n ^or to
be confided in, s^yi^g verse 4. Make this fellow return, and let him not g^e
down with^^ to Battle, least in the Battle he prove an Adversary to Us, for
wherewith should he reconcile himself to his Master Saul, should i^ not be
with the heads of these men? and howsoever he seemed unwilling to be sent back,
yet therein (says Oziander) he did but dissemble and spoke otherwise then he
thought, he was glad of the opportunity given to return, says Peter Martyr,
though he flatteringly glozed with the King by pretending the contrary, and to
think that David had any cogitation or purpose to serve a Foreign King in a
Battle against his own King, People, and Nation, is to make him an appar^nt
transgressor of the Law says Willet, which forbad all kind of Confederacy,
with uncircum^is^d Nations: by this time then I hope you see that David's
Ex^mple is impertinently produced to show the lawfulness o^ making an hostile
defensive war against your Sovereign.


Eristes. Wh^t s^y y^u to the third Example of Elisha the Proph^t, who h^d the
Elders of Israel to shut the door against t^^ Kings M^ssenger that came to
take away his head, and t^^^ ^ld him f^st?


Irenaeu^. I s y t^^t it is no more to the purpose then the former, for what
c^n you infer from thence more then this? that it is l^wfull to hold the
door fast shut against a Messenger, who shall in a violent illegal way come
to assaul^ (...) in our houses, though he come from the King? thi^ no doubt m y
be done cum moderamine in^ulpate t^t^l^. But what if the King should come in
Person to ass^ult you, will you do m^re then shut the door? will you t^ke
p^^^s of Or^n^^ce, Gu^s, P^kes and Pistols, an^ bid him be ^o^, or else you
will set him away with a p^w^er? should the King in a viol^nt illegal way
off^r to smite you on the head, you may hold up your hand, and awa^d the blow:
But if you strike him again, there is no Law (I think) either of God or man,
that would not condemn you for a Traitor in so doing, though you should do it
in your own defense, and how can you be sure, when you come with Mu kets and
Cannons into the open Field against the King, that you shall not do more then
smite him, horreseo referens (even that which I tremble to speak) mortally
wound his sacred Person, unless you can command your Muskets, and Cannons
that they should not hurt him, as well as any other. Do not then palliate your
opposition with the name of a mere defensive resistance which may prove so
hainously offensive, and contract that guilt of blood upon your Souls, and the
whole land, as would draw down Gods vengeance both upon them and it; and will
you wrest the command of so great a Prophet (as Elisha was) to countenance such
a defense, as might in event prove so horridly offensive? Quod Omen avertat
Deus.


Eristes. What say you to the last example of Azariah the high Priest thrusting
Vzziah the King (after he became Leprous) out of the Temple; being assisted
with 80 of his Brethren, who are commended for their valor in so doing, 2 Chronicles. 26.17.20.


Irenaeus. I say that I am sorry, to see you go down to the forge of the
Papists, there to sharpen your Weapons of defense, for your hostile defensive
War. The Papists say that the high Priests thrust the King out of the Temple
when he usurped the Priests Office, Ergo the Pope is above Kings. The reason of
their inference is, because no Inferior has power to lay hands on a
Superior, and by co-active power, to compel or repel him. You say the same
in effect, with a little change of the persons. The high Priest thrust the King
out of the Temple, therefore it is lawful for the People to resist Kings? And
you can give no reason of this inference, except you acknowledge the Peoples
Superiority above the Prince, and then you must dispense with the oath of
Supremacy, and wipe out that Text of Saint Peter, Where he wills you to submit
to the King as Supreme, 1 Pet. 2.17. Azariah the Priest, and the rest of the
Brethren did not assail King Vzziah's Person, presuming to burn Incense on
the Altar of God, neither did they thrust him out of the Temple by force; they
withstood him with Words, rebuking him for the breach of Gods Law. It
appertains not to thee Vzziah to burn Incense, Not with Weapons as your
Martial Terms import, and when the King would not be a^monished, but
indignabundus, in a chafe, contemning the Priests admonition, took a Censer in
his hand to offer Incense, the Lord then took him in hand, and caused the
L^^prosie to rise up in his forehead before the Priest, then there was no need
to bid him depart, the Text says, He hastened to go out because the Lord had
smitten him. God then thrust him out, and the Priests thrust him out, a^^ ^e
^^^^ed to go ou^, God thrust him our by infl^cting the visible punishment of
Leaprosie upon him, Visa lepr^ Sace^^^tes Regem leprosum d^s stine eg^^d eudum
^ament. Jose h. du^iq. Ju^^c. lib. 9. cap. ^1.
the Priest thrust him out by sharply rebuking him, p^o^^uncing ^im unclean,
or by admonishing him that the L^^prousie was risen up in his forehead, and
then being told that the spot of Leaprosie was upon him he f himself hasted to
go out.


Eristes. But in that the Priests are commended for valian men it sh^wes that
their work wa^ not only reproof but resistance ( ^s Bridges observes.)


Irenaeus. And is it no argument of ^alour, think you, to reprove a King ^penly
to his face; surely, albeit some dreaming Pr^phets who fear not to despise
Government, and speak evil of digniti^s, have of late by their open railing
against Princes, gone about to make their Persons contemptible, yet in former
times they were had in such awful regard, That it was held a matter of
courage, and valor to reprove them: because such reproves (if they were not
well taken, might cost those that reproved them their lives, as it did John
Baptist, and many of the Prophets. And therefore God when he sent his Prophets
to reprove Kings, he often bad them not to be afraid, and that God permitted
to his Prophets or Priests under the Law any further attempts against Princes,
then in words to reprove them, or to declare his will and precepts unto them, I
will not believe till I have better authority for it then Bridges his
observations.


Eristes. But we have warrantable examples and Presidents from the Reformed
Churches of Germany, France, Genevah, Scotland, Holland, to justify our taking
up arms in our own defense to be lawful, though against the King.


Irenae^^. Your Examples from Foreign Churches, without they have warrant
from the word of God for what they did, will be but weak proofs to justify
you in your doings, though you could prove your conformity with them to be full
and exact in all p^rticular Circumstances. But more distinctly,

First, I answer that none of the forenamed Protestant Churches have inserted
this amongst the Articles of their Confessions to be believed, as a positive
truth, that it is lawful for Subjects to take up defensive arms against their
lawful Sovereign, and if they had, for my part I would not believe it,
unless they could show better authority for it out of the word of God, then
Buchanan, Knoxe, Boroughs, Bridges, or any of that Anti-monarchicall Faction
have done.

Secondly, this briefly I may say, of any, or of all the Reformed Churches,
that if they had not Law for what they did, (as you for ought I know have none
for your defensive Arms against the King) then their doings were not
justifiable by the Laws of their Country in foro soli much less by the Law of
God in foro poli, and the reason why I dare not be peremptory in passing my
judgment upon the facts of other Churches, is because the circumstances must
be fully known before a fact can be rightly discerned, or judged to be lawful
or unlawful, and I have not so busied my self in other Commonwealths, as
that I dare definitively pronounce sentence of their doings, being perhaps not
thoroughly acquainted with the ground of them.

Thirdly, to impure to a whole Church, that which is taught or done by some in
the Church, or a facto ad jus, from a thing done by some in an Orthodox
Reformed Church to argue the lawfulness of doing it, were ridiculous, for many
things are taught and done in a Church, which are not taught and done by the
Church, and that which is done by a prevailing party in a Church, is often done
without the allowance and approbation of the best Divines in that Church, as
now: Should the decisions of the pact convention of Divines in this Church, or
the Votes of the factious Party take place, (who would, might they have their
wills, lead both Church and State in Triumph, and set their feet upon the neck
of Sovereignty) there is no doubt but the flower of the Nobility and Gentry in
this Kingdom, both the Universityes, the greatest and ablest part of Divines,
many thousands of the Kings most religious loyal Subjects of inferior rank,
together with very many of the ablest and most judicious of the House of
Commons, that (according to the rules of Religion, Loyalty, and Laws,) have
afforded their utmost assistance to His Majesty; should all be censured as
Delinquents, and many of them suffer under the name of Malignants: and ty no ne
(I presume) in his right wits could believe such a sentence to be the
definitive sentence of the Church and State essentially considered; though had
it not been timely withstood, it might and would have been the sentence of a
prevailing faction, in the Church and State; But the Lord of Hosts, I trust,
will take the cause of his Anointed into his own hands, and fight his battles,
and not suffer His Majesty, this Church and Nation to be so triumphed over, and
trampled upon, without a speedy revenge of such high and heinous indignities.

Lastly, Sum up the account, and then tell me whether as the Primitive Church
did, so you of this Church and Kingdom may not gain more by humble
supplicating, and peaceable submitting to Authority, then ever you are likely
to gain by a violent resisting of it. I will close up this point with a
remarkable passage out of Calvin.

Si a saevo principe crudeliter torquemur, si ab avaro aut luxurioso rapaciter
expilamur, si ab ignavo negligimur, si ab impio denique, and Sacrilego vexamur
ob pietatem: subeat primum delictorum nostrorum, recordatio quae talibus haud
dubio Domini flagellis castigantur, Inde humilitas impatientiam nostram
fraenabit: succurrat deinde, and haec cogitatio, non nostrum esse hujusmodi
malis mederi, hoc tantum esse reliqunum, ut Domini opem imploremus, cujus in
manu sunt Regum Corda, and Regnorum Inclinationes. Calvin Institut. lib. 4.
cap. 20. Sect. 29.

If we be cruelly oppressed by a cruel Prince, if we be polled, and pillaged
by a covetous or luxurious Prince, if we be negligently governed by a careless
Prince, if for godliness we be (as God be thanked we are not) persocuted by an
Impious and sacrilegious Prince, let us in the first place remember our sins,
which, no doubt, are corrected by God with such scourges; this will be a means
to bridle our impatience with humility, then let this thought come into our
minds, that it is not in our power (without Gods help) to mend or remedy such
evils, and therefore in the last place, it remains that we should implore the
help of God in whose hands are the hearts of Kings, and inclinations of
Kingdoms.

Have you any other coulourable pret^nces which may in some sort seemingly
excuse, though in no sort justify your taking up Arms to resist the King, who
is the highest power in this Kingdom next under God, and therefore cannot be
resisted without peril of damnation, Romans 13.2


Eristes. You mistake Irenaeus, we do not resist the King or his legal power,
but only his verbal personal illegal command, which we may do without
danger of incurring the penalty threatened by the Apostle to such as resist the
higher power, Romans 13.2.


Irenaeus. The Apostle in that Chapter commands all who live under authority to
be subject to the higher power, and proves by five persuasive convincing
reasons, that they ought to be subject.

First, ab Authore, from the Author of all power qui^ non est potestas nisi a
Deo, because there is no power but of God.

Secondly, he proves that all must be subject to the higher power, a bono
ordinis, from the good of order, quia potestates quae sunt a Deo, ordinatae
sunt, be^^use the power^ that be, are ordained and set in order by God one
above another, and we should be Authors of confusion, and perverters of that
comely order which God, who is the God of order, and not of confusion, has
ordained, if we should refuse to live in subjection unto him, whom he has
appointed to rule over us.

Thirdly, that we are to be subject to the higher power, he proves a malo
culpae, because it is a sin to resist the Supreme Magistrate, or the higher
power, for he that resists the power, resists the Ordinance of God. verse.
2. Beware then how thou resist thy Prince upon any pretense or take p^rt with
such as do resist him by force of Arms, for his Person is sacred, his
ordination divine, and cannot without sin be resisted.

Fourthly, that we must be subject to the higher power the Apostles proves a
malo panae, from the evil of punishment, b^^^use they that resist, and will
not be subject, shall unavoidably and deserv^^ly receive to themselves crim^,
ju^gement, if not tempor^ll in this world, yet most certainly eternal in the
world to come, unless they repent.

Lastly, be proves that we must be subject to the higher powers a bono
se^ie^atis, from the good of Society, because we that live in a civil Society,
receive and reap much good by their government, they are the Ministers of God
for our good. Were there no King appointed to rule over u^, we should soon see
a general Ar^xy, Disorder and Confusion in all est^tes; in the Church such
abuses, as would m^ke us to abhor the Sanctuary of the Lord: in the
Commonwealth such hai^ous enormities and impieties, a^ would vex our Souls to
see and behold them. In the 17. 18. 19. Chapters of the Book of Judges, there
^^e may read of disorder upon disorder, and still in the close this is alleged
as the chief cause of all those disorders, That there was no King in Israel,
to curb and restrain the insolent unruly passions of men, but every one was
permitted to do what seemed good in his own eyes, and no wonder that all
things in the Church and State were then out of order, when there was no King,
or no authority in the Supreme Magistrate to keep men in due order, by all
which it evidently appears that Praestat sub malo Principe esse, quam sub
nullo, It is better to live under the government of an evil or Tyrannical
Prince, then to have none at all to govern u^.

Wherefore, because all power is of God; because the powers that be, are
tetagmenai ordained and set in order by God; because it is a sin to resist the
higher powers; because judgment both temporal and eternal is the punishmen^
of that sin: lastly, because they are the Ministers of God for our good,
therefore as the Apostle infers, we must of necessity be subject unto them, not
only for fear of the temporal sword, or in^u^ring their wrath and disple^su^e
(who cannot but be angry and much displeased wit^ those that resist them) but
al^o for Conscience sake tow^rd^ God, who has ^id a ^ye upon the Conscience of
all ^nferiou^ o p^rsor^^ the D^^y of Subjection to their Sup^^^ours, y^^ t^oug^
they be such a^ t^^ hig^er power ^^en were, Tyr^^t to their own Su^^^^ and
Perse^me^ of Christian Pro-fessour, and prose^^ Enemies of the C^ristian faith.

He that wa^ Empe^our when Saint Paul wro^e that Epistle to the Romans, was
Nero, a Tyrant, a v^le an^ violent opposer of Christ^^n Re^^gion. Nero (says
le^^ed Moulin) was a Monster in nature, the shame of humane ^^^d, al^^ first
Emperor that began to persecute the Church, nevertheless the Apostle Romans 13.
speaking of that power which was then in being, says that it was ordained by
God, and that whosoever resisted the same, resisted the ordinance of God, and
by their resistance did deservedly pull upon themselves damnation: and if in
the Apostles judgment it was a sin deserving damnation to resist Nero, a
bloody Tyrant, and cruel persecuter of Christians; what a heinous sin are they
guilty of, and what a judgment do they deserve that resist His sacred
Majesty, our Sovereign Lord King Charles, who is the most gracious and
religious King in Christendom.


Eristes. I tell you we neither resist the King, nor His Legal power, but only
His illegal will and command.


Irenaeus. First, are you sure that all, or any of the Kings commands which you
withstand, are illegal, if they be not, then Boroughs your chief Advocate
freely grants, That there is no help left you, but either to fly, or passively
to obey them, though he command you to obey such Laws as be sinful. If they be
every way illegal, neither agreeable to the Law of God, nor the Laws of the
Land, then you may do well to inform us, how you may with a safe and
satisfied Conscience resist them, and neither resist the King, nor His Legal
power; that you may resist them by a bare denial of obedience unto them (if
such a denial may be termed a resistance) is formerly granted; but may you
resist them with armed violence, will you cut his illegal commands in pieces
with your Swords, or beat them back with your Cannons; do not alter the state
of the question, and the point is clear, That the resistance which you make,
is not only against the verbal commands of the King, but against the King
himself who gave those commands, and by consequence against that Legal Kingly
power, or Royal Authority, which can never be divorced from His sacred Person
while He remains a King; for though his authority may by Delegation or
Commission be in His Courts, where His Person is not ever present, yet that His
person can be any where, or at any time without His Royal authority is such a
sublime point, such an hidden mystery of State, such a new piece of Divinity,
that my faith is not strong enough to believe it; nor yours, or any other man's
wit sufficiently able to prove it. Surely the Primitive Christians were dull
and stupid, who, poor, simple, ignorant Souls, out of mere simplicity
suffered so much, because they were not capable of this subtle, nice
distinction, which were it once admitted for current and Canonical; Subjects
might resist the Prince, and lay violent hands up in His Person, and yet be
neither Traitors nor Rebels, but canonized Saints; And what can the poor
Kingdom expect, where the Person of the Prince is not held inviolable and
sacred? but combustion and confusion.

The Jews have a proverbiall saying, Migrandum est ex illo loco uhi Rex non
timetur, That men should haste out of that place, Country, or Kingdom where the
King is not feared, thereby intimating that doubtless some great and fearful
judgment does hang over it.

Oh then let me exhort you who have taken up Arms against your Sovereign, no^
to turn Religion into Reb^ll^on, patience into violence, fidelity into perjury,
subject (...) into sedition, and you London Lecturers that have been t e chief
Trumpetters to this desperate, unnatural, bloody, irreligious War, turn not
your spiritual Militiae, into that which is carnal, do not exhort men in the
fear of God to fight against the King, for that fear of God which does not
strengthen, but abate the fear of the King, and shrink (...) obedience; it is
(...) a (...) ^ented, devised, ^o^ ^^^^ted by m^^, and taught or approved by
God; the true Religion and fear^ of God ^^^heth (...) fear and honor the
King, to be subject (...) him, and not to resist Him. I will conclude with a
Prayer.

THen that art the God of Peace, settle the Peace of this dis^ed Kingdom, by
casting faction out of the State, and Schism^^ of the Church, and by
undeceiving the minds (...) that have been seduced into open rebellion, under a
pre^^^^^ of Piety and Religion, that so we may come once more to live a quiet
pe^ceable life in all godliness and honesty, under the Religiou^ Governme^^ of
our gracious Sovereign, whom do thou O Lord long preserve to reign over us
an happy King of many blessings.
