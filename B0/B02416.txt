The Country Lovers conquest.
In winning a coy Lass.
In Country Terms he uses homely greeting,
And says by all means she must be his sweeting.
He lets her know that he has riches store,
And wonders that she can desire more
At length she did incline as he does tell
And liked his loving motion wondrous well.
To a pleasant new Tune, very much in use.


ONce I loved a Lass
with a Rouling eye.
She was ^ond and fickle
so was never I.
If you ^ill believe me
she was wondrous fair,
And it much did grieve me
to loose market ware,
I began to woe her
Like a man indeed.
Soon as I came to her
thus I did proceed.
Dearest be not coy
but in love agree,
I Am my Mothers joy
she loves none but me:
All her care is for me
how to get a wife,
And thou know I love thee
as I do my life,
Prethy be not cruel,
but be kind and free,
Thou shall be my jewel
I Will love none but thee,


What care I for coin
since I have a stock,
If thou will be mine,
I Will take thee in thy smock:
Come let us make a bargain
whilst i am in the mind
And I will be constant
thou shall ever find,
I am young and lusty
and a proper Lad.
Come and let me kiss thee
for to make me glad.
I have House and Land
and something else beside:
All at thy command
if thou will be my Bride,
Sheep and Cows and Puen
and such riches store,
Therefore be not Sullen
can thou wish for more:
I have six good Oxen
drawing in a plow:
If thou can not love
prethy let me know.
I have danced with Sarah
and with little Nan,
Betty she told Grace
I was a handsome man:
Doll and Sue and Prudence
would not me deny,
Frank did smile upon me
as she passed by.
But it is no matter
I will have my mind,
For I will not flatter
if thou will be kind
Long did I thus woe.
still she did deny.
What I then should do
or whether live or dye
I could not imagine,
for I scarce could speak.
Then I thought for certain
that my heart would break
Till my Mother told me
without all dispute,
I must not be daunted,
but renew my Suit.
To her then I hasted
with a good intent,
To take no denial
I was truly bent:
Though she called me Bumki^
I was never the worse,
Knowing amongst Lovers
these are words of course,
I was so resolved
for to win the field,
That I would not leave her
till I made her yield,
Then I leapt for joy
as I will might do,
She that was so coy
and so hard to woe:
Willing was to love me,
and to be my Bride:
Having now forsaken
all the world beside:
Thus I made a Conquest,
of a maiden fair,
That with any Girl
ith Country may compare
