The Batchelors feast, OR,
The difference betwixt, a single life and a double:
being the Batchelors pleasure, and the married Man's trouble,

To a pleasant new tune called, With a hie dildo, dill.




AS I walked forth of late,
where grass and flowers spring,
I heard a Bachelor,
within an Harbor sing,
The tennor of his song,
contained much melody,
It is a gallant thing,
to live at liberty,
With hie dill do dill,
hie ho dildurlie:
It is a delightful thing,
to live at liberty.
We Batchelors can flaunt,
in Country and in Town,
And in good company,
may meryly spend a crown:
We may do as we list,
our lives from cares are free,
O it is a gallant thing,
to live at liberty,
With hie dill etc.
No Cradle have we to rock,
nor Children that do cry,
No Landlords rent to pay,
no Nurses to supply:
No Wife to scould and brawle,
now we still keep good company
With them that take delight,
to live at liberty,
With hie dill, etc.
While married men do lie,
with worldly cares oppressed,
We Batchelors can sleep,
and sweetly take our rest,
O married men must seek,
for Gossips and a Nurse,
Which heavy makes the heart,
but light it makes the purse,
With hie dill, etc.
For Candell and for Soape,
and many knacks besides,
For Clouts and swaddling bands,
he likewise must provide,
To pay for sops and wine,
he must also agree,
O it is a delightful thing,
to live at liberty,
With hie dill, etc.
A man that does intend,
to lead a quiet life,
Must practice day and night,
to please his longing wife,
New fashions must be had,
as often as she them see,
O it is a pleasant thing
to live at liberty:
With hie dill, dill,
hie, hoe, dildurly,
It is a delightful thing:
to live at liberty.
The second part,
To the same tune.




THe Surgeon thriues by fencing schools,
Some for strong liquor pawn their tools
For one wise man there is twenty fools,
oh when shall we be married?
In time of youth when I was wild,
Who touches Pitch, must be defild,
Moll is afraid that she is with child,
peace Peter.
The poor still hope for better days,
I do not love these long delays,
All love and charity decays,
in the days of old:
I Am very loath to pawn my cloak.
Mere poverty does me provoke,
They say a scald head is soon broke,
poor trading.
The Dutchmen thrive by Sea and Land,
Women are ships and must be mand,
Lets bravely to our Colors stand,
Courage my hearts of gold:
I read in modern Histories,
The King of Swedens Victories,
At Islington there is Pudding pies,
hot Custards.
The Tapiter is undone by chalk.
Tush it is in vain to prate and talk,
The Parrat pratles, walk knaves, walk,
Duke Humfry lies in Paul's,
The Soldier has but small regard,
There Is weekly news in Paul's Churchyard
The poor man cries the world grows hard,
cold Winter.
From Longlane cloathe and Turnestile boots
O fie upon these scabbed cootes,
The cheapest meat is Reddish roots,
come, all these for a penny:
Light my Tobacco quickly here,
There lies a pretty woman near,
This boy will come to naught I fear,
proud Coxcombe.
The World is full of odious sins,
It Is ten to one but this horse winnes,
Fools set stools to break wise men's shinnes
this man's more knave than fool:
Jane often in private meets with Tom,
Husband ya're kindly welcome home,
Have any money? lend me some,
I Am broken.
In ancient times all things were cheap,
It Is good to look before thou leap,
When Corn is ripe, it is time to reap,
once walking by the way.
A jealous man the Cuckos loathes,
The gallant complements with oaths,
A wench will make you sell your clothes.
run Broker.
The Courtier and the country man,
Let Us live as honest as we can.
When Arthur first in Court began,
his men wore hanging sleeves.
In May when Grass and Flowers be green*
The strangest sight that ere was seen.
God bless our gracious King and Queen,
from danger.
