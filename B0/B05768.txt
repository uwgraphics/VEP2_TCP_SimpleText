Sack for my Money: Or, A Description of the operation of Sack that is stilled
in the Spanish Nation: Then buy it, deny it, Like it or leave it,
Not one amongst ten but is willing to have it.

The tune is, Wet and weary.


GOod Fellows a^l both great and small,
rejoice at this my Ditty,
Whilst I do sing, good news I bring,
to the Country and the City;
Let every Lad and Lass be glad,
(for who will true Love smother)
And being here my joy and dear,
we will kindly kiss each other:
The purest Wine so brisk and fine,
the Alligant and Sherry,
I hold it good to purge the blood,
and make the senses merry.
It Is sparkling Sack that binds the back,
and cherishes the heart boys,
For recompense just eighteen pence,
you must give for a Quart boys;
Away with Beer and such like geer,
that makes our spirits muddy,
For Wine complete will do the feat,
that we all notes can study,
The purest Wine so brisk and fine,, etc.
Rich Malligo is pure I know
to purge out Melancholy,
And he that is sick it cures quick,
and makes their senses jolly,
It rarifies the dullest eyes,
of those that are most paler,
And bravely can compose a man
of a very Prick-lows Tailor.
The richest Wine so brisk and fine, etc.
The meerest fool shall teach a School
by Clarets operation,
And make some fight li^e men of might,
or Champions of a Nation,
It is more fine then Brandewine,
the Butterboxes Poison,
Who drinking dares, in Neptunes wars,
reign Master of the Ocean.
Canary Sack makes firm the back,
both Alligant and Sherry,
Are proved good to clear the blood,
and make the senses merry.
A longing Lass, whose Custerd-face,
her inward grief discloses,
With drinking Wine so sweet and fine,
will gain a pair of Roses;
It does revive dead folks alive,
and helps their former weakness,
It is so pure that it does cure,
a Maiden of her sickness,
This Rhenish Wine so brisk and fine, etc.
The Drawar still the same shall fill,
to elevate the heart boys,
For Rhenish gay you now must pay,
just twelve pence for a Quart boys:
Who would be ty'de to Brewers side,
whose measures do so vary,
When we may sit to raise our wit,
with drinking of Canary,
The purest Wine, etc.


THe French Wine pure for 7 pence surt
you shall have choice and plenty,
At this same rate to drink in Plate,
which is both good and dainty:
A maunding Cove that does it love,
'twill make him dance and caper,
And Captain Puff will have enuff,
to make him brag and vapor,
The purest Wine so brisk and fine,
the Alligant and Sherry,
I hold it good to purge the blood,
and make the senses merry.
And also we that do agree,
as one, for boon good fellows,
We Will sing and laugh and stoutly quaff,
and quite renounce the Alehouse,
For Ale and Beer are now both dear,
the price is raised in either,
Then let us all both great and small,
toth' Tavern walk together:
The purest Wine, etc.
The Tradesman may at any day,
for their own recreation,
Be welcome still to Ralph or Will,
and have accommodation,
For why their Coin will buy the Wine,
and cause a running Barrel,
But if you are drunk your wits are sunk,
and gorrill'd guts will quarrel.
The purest Wine, etc.
The Cobbler fast will stay the last,
for he is a lusty drinker,
He Will pawn his soul to have a Bowl,
to drink to Tom the Tinker:
The Broom-man he will be as free,
to drink courageous flashes,
If Cole grow scant, before he will want,
he will burn his Brooms to ashes.
The purest Wine, etc.
The Fidling Crowd that grows so proud,
will pawn their Pipes and Fiddles,
They Will strike and crack with bowls of Sack,
and cut the queerest whiddles.
They Will rant and tare like men of War,
they voices roars like Thunder,
And growing cursed their Fiddles burst,
and breaks 'um all asunder.
The purest Wine, etc.
The Country Blades with their own Maids
at every merry meetings,
For Ale and Cakes at their Town Wakes,
which they did give their Sweetings,
Upon their friends a Crown will spend,
in Sack that is so trusty,
Twill please a Maid that is decayed,
and make a Booby lusty:
Be ruled by me and we will agree,
to drink both Sack and Sherry,
For that is good to cleanse the blood,
and make our senses merry.
