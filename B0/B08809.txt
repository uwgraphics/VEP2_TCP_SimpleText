The Complaint of the Shepherd Harpalus,
To a New Tune.
woodcut of shepherd woodcut of lady

POOR Harpalus oppressed with Love sat by a Christial brook,
Thinking his sorrows to remove often times therein did look:
And hearing how on pibble stones the murmuring Rider ran,
As if he had bequeathed his groans unto it thus he began.
Fair streams quoth he that pities me, and hears my matchless moan,
If thou be going to the Sea as I now suppone,
Attend my plaint^ past all relief which dolefully I breath,
Icquaint the Sea Nym^s with ye grief which still procutes m^ death.
Who sitting in the clifty Rocks may in their Songs express
While as they comb their golden locks poor Harpalus distress;
And so perhaps some pass^ngers that passes by the way,
May stay and listen for to hear them sing this doleful lay.
Poor Harpalus a Shepherd Swain more rich in youth then store,
Loved fair Philenea baplesse man Philenea O therefore.
Who still remorcelesse hearted Maid took pleasure in his pain,
And his good will poor soul repaid with undeserved disdain.
Never Shepherd loved Sheperdesse more faithfully then he
Nere Shepherd yet beloved less of Shepherdess could be.
How often did he with dying looks to her his woes impart,
How often his sight did testify the dolor of his heart.
How often from Valleys to the Hills did he his grief rehearse,
How often ecchoed they his ills a back again alas.
How often on barks of stately pines, of Beech, of Holly green,
Did he engage on mournful lines, the grief he did sustain.
Yet all his plaints could have no place, to change Philena's mind,
The more his sorrows did increase, the more she proved unkind.
The thought thereof has wearied ^ate* poor Harpalus did move,
That overcome with high despair he lost both life and love.
