The Shoomakers delight. Or. A New Dialogue betwixt a West Country Shooemakers
and his Love.
Who after five years Travel for her sake
He back returned and she amends did make,
For after he to her ha^ told his mind
She seemed not at all to him unkind,
Young men and maids then read these lines and see
How they in love did lovingly agree.
To the Tune of, When Soll will cast no light.




ON Midsummer day as I
abroad was walking,
A young man and a maid
I heard a talking.
Near to a shady Grove
flowers were springing,
And the brave Nighting-gale
sweetly was singing.
The youngman brisk and bold
thus fell to woeing,
And with his fair maid
fain would be doing,
With speeches meek and mild
and kind entreating,
Saying his heart would break
if she forsake him.
My joy and only dear
pray thee believe me,
If thou will be my wife
i will never deceive thee
No store of means I have
I tell thee plainly.
But i will work day and night
for to maintain thee.
What I do promise thee
shall be performed,
By no one in the world
thou shall be wronged.
I Will venture life or Limbs
for thee my Jewel,
Then be not thou unkind
nor prove not cruel.
I am not one of those
that keeps a bragging,
And of their house and land
their tongues are wagging.
My love is faithful bent
then he contented,
If thou will be my wife
thou't never repent it.
My trade it still will hold
this I am certain,
A good Husband I will be
my dearest darling,
I am of Crispins trade
a brave Shooemaker,
He loved a princess dear
and never forsak't her,
Nor I Will not thee forsake
my dearest Betty,
Thy smiling countenance
shines so pretty,
If I five thousand pound
had in my keeping,
Thou should it all command
my dearest sweeting.
So if thou can but find
in heart to love me,
Speak freely now thy mind
as it behooves thee,
Speak freely from thy heart
if thou will have me,
And to thee I Will prove true
as God shall save me.

The Maids loving reply My love and only dear,
I joy to see thee.
For when you absent were
oh! how it did grieve me,
Both day and night i will swear
I thought upon thee,
I wondered in my heart
what was come on thee.

The Young man. These five long years my dear
thou know I wander
In City and in Town
like any stranger,
And am returned again
once more to try thee,
How can find in thy heart
for to deny me.

The Maid. Well seeing thou art returned
thou art welcome to me,
By all the powers above,
i will not forgo thee,
Though Father frown at me
and mother murmour,
All the friends that I have
shall not part's in sunder.
Because I find thee plain
in words and speeches,
You tell me that you have
no store of riches,
Me to maintain my dear
be not thou fearful,
I have five hundred pound
if thou will be careful.
Therefore be not dismayed
but be contened,
All the friends that I have
shall not prevent it,
But I will be thy wife
and will endeavor
To lead a quiet life
with thee for ever,

The young man. Oh! how my heart with joy.
my dear has filled.
Because to my request
kindly she yielded,
Now we will live in peace
and love together,
As the old Proverb goes,
like birds of a Feather.

Thus you may plainly see
that time and leisure,
Many things brings to pass
therefore Endeavor.
Young men prove constant still
maids do not dissemble,
And then you need not fear
for to live single.
