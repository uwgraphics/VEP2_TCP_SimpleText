A Paraphrase upon the Lords Prayer, and the Creed.
IF any be distressed, and feign would gather
Some comfort, let him hasten to Our Father,
For we of help and hope are all bereaven,
Unless thou succor us,
-- which art in Heaven,
Thou show mercy there, and for the same
We praise thee, singing -- hallowed be thy Name:
Of our distresses, Lord, cast up the sum,
Show us thy joys, and let
-- thy kingdom come:
We mortal are, and alter from our birth,
Thou constant art; -- thy will be done on earth,
Thou made the Earth, Skies, Stars, and Planets seven,
Thy Name be blessed here,
-- as it is in heaven:
Nothing we have wherewith our debts to pay,
Unless thou give to us, -- give us this day
Wherewith to cloth us, wherewith to be fed,
For without thee we want
-- our daily bread:
We want, but want no sin, for no day passes
But we do sin: -- forgive us our trespasses,
No man from sin that ever free did live;
Forgive us, Lord, our sins,
-- as we forgive
If we repent our sins thou never disdain'st us;
We pardon -- them their trespasses against us:
Forgive us that is past, and new path tread us;
Direct us always in thy truth,
-- and lead us
As thine own people, and thy chosen Nation,
Into all truth, but -- not into temptation:
Thou that of all good graces art the giver,
Permit us not to wander,
-- but deliver
Us from the assaults of World, of Flesh, of Devil,
So shall thy mercies free -- us from all evil.
To these Petitions let both Church and Laymen
With one consent of voice and heart, say
-- Amen.
SInce it be fit that I account should give,
What way unto Salvation I Believe
Of my profession here the sum I gather,
First I confess a faith
-- in God the Father
In God who without helper or partaker,
Was of himself the Worlds -- Almighty maker
And first gave time his being, who gave breath,
To all the creatures
-- both of heaven and earth:
Our everlasting welfare does consist,
In his great mercies, -- and in Jesus Christ
The second person of that three in one,
The Fathers elect, and
-- his only Son,
That ever blessed and incarnate Word,
Which our Redeemer is, our life, -- our Lord,
For why? by Satan's guile we were deceived,
Christ was that means of help,
-- which was conceived
Yea when we were in danger to be lost,
Conceived for us -- by the Holy Ghost,
And that we might not ever be forlorn,
For our eternal safety he was
-- borne
Borne as a man, that man might not miscarry,
Even of the substance -- of the Virgin Mary,
And lo a greater mercy and a wonder,
He that can make all suffer
-- suffered under
The Jewish spite, which all the world reviled at,
(...) Romish tyrannies of -- Pontius Pilate,
(...) him I do believe who was envied,
Who with extremest hate
-- was crucified,
Who being life it self, to make assured
Our souls of safety, was both -- dead and buried,
And that no servile fear in us might dwell,
To conquer
-- he descended into hell,
Where no infernal power had power to lay
Command upon him, but on -- the third day
The force of death and hell he did constrain,
And so in Triumph
-- he arose again
Yea the Almighty power advanced his head,
As well above all things as -- from the dead,
Then that from thence gifts might to men be given,
With glory
-- he ascended into heaven,
Where that supreme and everlasting Throne,
Which was prepared, he climbed -- and sits on,
That blessed seat where he shall make abode,
To plead for us at
-- the right hand of God,
And no where should he be enthroned rather,
Then there, for he is God as is -- the Father,
And therefore with an equal love delight I,
To praise and serve them both as one
-- Almighty:
Yet in their office there is a difference,
And I believe that Jesus Christ -- from thence
Shall in that great and universal doom,
Return, and that with Angels
-- he shall come
To question such as at his Empire grudge,
Even those that have presumed him -- to judge
And that black day shall be so Catholic,
As I believe not only that -- the quick
Shall to that grand Assize be summoned,
But he will both adjudge them -- d the dead:
Moreover in the Godhead I conceive,
Another Person in whom -- I do believe
For all my hope and blessednsse were lost,
If I beeleeve not -- in the Holy Ghost,
Although vain Schismatics through pride and folly
Contemn her power, I do believe -- the holy
Chaste Spouse of Christ, for whom so many search,
By marks uncertain, the true -- Catholic Church,
I do believe, God keep us in this Union,
That there shall be for ever -- the Communion
Of Gods elect, and that he still acquaints
His children in the fellowship -- of Saints,
Though damned be men's natural condition,
By grace in Christ I look for -- the remission
Of all my foul misdeeds, for there begins
Deaths end, which is the punishment -- of sins,
Moreover I the Sadducees infection
Abhor, and do believe -- the resurrection
Yea though I turn to dust, yet through God I,
Expect a glorious rising -- of the body,
And that exempted from the cares here rife,
I shall enjoy perfection, -- and the life
That is not subject unto change or wasting,
But ever blessed, and for -- everlasting.
This is my joy, which that it fail not when
It most should speed me, let God say -- Amen.
To whom, that he so much vouchsafe me may,
Thus as a member of the Church I pray.
FINIS.
