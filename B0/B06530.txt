The West-Country Wooing: OR, The Merry Conceited Couple.
In Pleasant Terms he lets her know his mind,
And fairly wooes her, for to make her kind:
At first she seemed coy to his persuasion,
And put him off with many a slye Evasion:
But finding at the last his Love wa^ Constant,
Her heart she did resign from that same instant.
To the Tune of, When Sol will cast no light: Or, My pretty little rogue.

MY Joy and on'y Dear,
come sit down by me,
For thou tha't plainly hear
I mean to try thee:
If thou can love a Lad
brisk, young and lively,
I Will make thy heart full glad,
thou shall live finely.
Thy pretty rolling eye,
and wast so slender,
Thy forehead smooth and high,
thy lips so tender:
Has so ensnared my heart,
that I must love thee,
Therefore i will not depart,
till pity move thee.
Alas kind Sir, she said,
what has possessed ye,
For to delude a Maid,
be not so hasty;
Your flatering words that is past,
can no ways move me,
For to repent at last,
or yield to love ye.
The Second part,
to the same Tune.
WE know that young men can
cog, lie, and flatter,
And make vows, now and than,
to mend the matter:
With such slights cunningly.
they do deceive us,
Brings us to beggary,
and then they leave us.
Fear not my dear (quoth he)
that I dissemble,
Or that such false Young Men
I do resemble:
I have both house and land,
good Gold and riches,
And all at thy command,
pray mark my speeches.
Your house and land perhaps
you think may move me,
But I fear after-clapps,
If I should love ye:
Therefore my Maidenhead
I will make much on it,
For never a false young man
shall have a touch on it.
O stay my Love, he said,
make further trial,
Be not so resolute
in your denial;
Fear not but you shall find
I will content thee,
And bravely please thy mind,
none shall prevent me.
What pleasure can a Maid
find in your dealing,
When you her kindness think,
not worth concealing.
Young Men are apt to blab,
what is done in private,
And well I understand
what it is you drive at.
My pretty Rogue, he said,
do not misdoubt me,
Why should you live a Maid,
and think I flout ye?
In my Love, I promise
for to persever,
And seal it with a kiss,
to last for ever.
If that you love as much
as you profess it,
And that your truth is such,
as you express it;
Quoth she take hand and heart
and use your pleasure,
For I will never part
from such a treasure.
O how it joys my mind,
(quoth he) my jewel,
That thou will now be kind,
and no more cruel;
Venus that Goddess she
will smile to know it,
How we in love agree,
when we shall show it.
So from that happy hour,
they were united,
And to a pleasant Bower
he her invited:
Where they with sport and play,
kindly imbrasing,
There past the time away,
Lovers Ioys trasing.
FINIS.
