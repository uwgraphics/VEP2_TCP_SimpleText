A ^^^^Y T^ THE CELEBRATION OF THE ANNIVERSARY DAY OF HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTH And
RESTITUTION. May 29, 1630/60.
It Was a rich dress great Englands Genius wore
When she attended on her Lord to shore;
When in her aemulous brav'ry of May
She with rich garments strowd the Royal way;
As if by Golden Jove she ravished seemed,
The Twins of Joy and Glory to have seemed
Often had she strugled with renewed mischance,
Impregnant hopes of her deliverance;
Till a ripe birth of Fate did Heaven send,
Blessed the beginning, and then Crowned the end.
Then her luxuriant pride could not devise
A satisfaction to her curious eyes;
She viewed her self in the glass of her great fame,
There frighted, as if she were not the same,
By monstrous shapes of Government deformed,
And all her pristine strength and beauty scorned,
To foreign Triumphs she addressed her sight,
And skewd at them as falling Meteors flight:
Her wondering looks at last fixed on her Prince,
She took the measure of her greatness thence;
The Arts of all Magnificence were scanned,
And the vast reach of mighty Glory span'd;
While Jove himself did on her Monarch wait
The observant clouds were the Canopy of state,
And gave the King the Empire of the day,
That cheerful time might on his Honor stay.
Now does this An'versary all renew
And multiplied reflect them to our view,
This Happy Day, shall be the womb o'th year
Our Peace and Plenty were begotten here:
Indeed too scant a Festival for YOU,
(The Birth and our Redemption make two,)
Great Sir, your Crowded Blessings cannot lie
Within the space in which one Sun does dye;
Take the whole revolution of Time
And let there be no Holy Day but thine;
And yet the pious world shall worship pay
In this enough to every Sainted Day:
Not all the miracles that have been wrought
But may within thy Rubric well be brought,
While our Posterity shall learn to be
Hereafter more Religious (Charles) for thee.
Thus are our Raptures, and our Ecstasies,
(When your first bright Approaches seized our Eyes)
Perpetuated into solid Joy, and thence
Into Religion, whose blessed Frankincense
Ascends on high, and pleased Heaven resumes
Her weighty Favors in such thankful Fumes;
Sublimed thus by Divine and Sacred Art,
Joy, like the vital Spirits fills our Heart.
And may no other Passion swell the State,
Nor these high stoods of Gladness e're Abate.
