AN Answer to the Maiden's Tragedy: OR, The Lamentation of a Young Man, Near
Wolverhampton, for the Death of a Young Maiden; which of late has been a great
Grief and Trouble to him, for his Unkindness to her.
To the Tune of, Russel 's Farewell.






YOu Lovers all both far and near,
pray listen to my moan;
I wronged my Love, my only Dear,
the like was never known:
I proved indeed her fatal fall,
by my Disloyalty,
For which I fear in time I shall
a sad Example be.
Love thou art sleeping in the Grave,
and I am left behind;
No peace or comfort can I have,
but a tormented mind:
The Heart within my Breast does bleed,
no Pleasure can I see;
Ever thou had done that bloody Deed,
would I had died for thee.
What Protestations did I make,
that I did thee adore?
Yet did at last my Love forsake,
and this torments me soret
Sad Torments do I under go,
for my Disloyalty,
The Eyes of mine like Fountains flow,
would I had died for thee.
The Golden Chain of Love I broke,
and did my promise slig^t,
So that at length a fatal streak,
did prove thy ruin quite:
When at the point of sad di'pair,
thou wrought'st this Tragedy;
My Soul is styled with grief and care,
would I had died for thee.
After a tedious long delay,
we did together meet,
And pitched upon our Wedding Day,
our bl^ssings to complete:
She waited long yet all in vain,
then with a sigh said she,
True Love is a tormenting Pain,
no Man so false as he.
I seemed unconcerned then.
t^o' I her Heart betrayed;
And never came a near her when,
this Pitti^us Moan she mad^:
But now my Dearest thou art dead,
and I no comfort see,
All Joy and Peace is from me sled,
would I had died for thee.
I with the World could freely part,
to be releas^d from thrall;
Now I alone do feel the smart,
for thou art past it all:
While I in Storms of Grief and Woe,
feel Endless Misery
This Grief I cannot under go,
would I had died for thee.
When ever I wander all alone,
methinks her voice I hear,
And sometimes with a dying groan,
which kills my Heart with fear:
Then do I start and turn away,
as frighted woefully,
And in that p^ssion sighing say,
would I had died for thee.
When I her bleeding Ghost behold,
wrapped in a Winding Sheet;
And on her Head a Crown of Gold,
with voice exceeding sweet:
Dear Thomas, Thomas most unkind,
why do you stay? said she,
Why do you tarry thus behind?
make have and follow me.
Thus am I in distraction hurled,
denied of quiet rest;
And though I live it from the World,
my very Soul's oppressed:
I Would fain surrender up my Breath,
to give me case, said he,
For Life is worse to me than Death,
would I had died for thee.
