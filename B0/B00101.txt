A Noble Marquess,
As he did ride a hunting
hard by a Forest side,
A fair and comely Maiden,
As she did sit a spinning,
his gentle eye espide:
Most fair and lovely,
And of comely grace was she,
although in simple attire;
She sung full sweetly,
With pleasant voice melodiously,
which set the Lords heart on fire;
The more he looked, the more he might,
Beauty bred his hearts delight,
And to this Damsel
then he went.
God speed (quoth he) thou famous flower,
Fair Mistress of this homely Bower,
Where love and virtue
dwells with sweet content.
With comely gesture,
And modest mild behavior
she bade him welcome then,
She entertained him
In faithful friendly manner,
and all his Gentlemen.
The Noble Marquess
In's heart felt such a flame,
which set his senses at strife,
Quoth he, fair Maiden,
Show me soon what is thy name,
I mean to make thee my wife.
Grissell is my name quoth she,
Far unfit for your degree,
silly Maiden,
and of Parents poor.
Nay, Grissell, thou art rich, he said,
A virtuous, fair, and comely Maid,
Grant me thy love,
and I will ask no more.
At length she consented,
And being both contented,
they married were with speed:
Her Country Russet
Was changed to Silk and Velvet,
as to her state agreed:
And when that she
Was trimly tired in the same,
her beauty shined bright,
Far staining every
Other fair and Princely Dame
that did appear in her sight.
Many envied her therefore,
Because she was of Parents poor,
And t'wixt her Lord and she
great strife did raise:
Some said this, and some said that,
And some did call her Beggars brat,
And to her Lord
they would her often dispraise.
O Noble Marquess,
Quoth they, why do thou wrong us,
thus basely for to wed,
That might have gotten
An honorable Lady
into your Princely bed?
Who will not now
Your Noble Issue still deride,
which shall hereafter be borne,
That are of blood so base,
Borne by the Mothers side,
the which will bring them in scorn.
Put her therefore quite away,
And take to you a Lady gay,
Whereby your Lineage
may renowned be.
Thus every day they seemed to prate,
That malic'd Grissells good estate,
Who all this while
took it most patiently.
When that the Marquess
Did see that they were bent thus
against his faithful Wife,
Whom he most dearly,
Tenderly, and entirely,
beloved as his life,
Minding in secret
For to prove her patient heart
thereby her foes to disgrace,
Thinking to show her
A hard discourteous part,
that men might pity her case:
Great with child this Lady was,
And at last it came to pass,
Two goodly children
at one birth she had,
A Son and Daughter God had sent,
Which did their Father well content,
And which did make
their Mothers heart full glad,
Great royal Feasting
Was at these Childrens Christning,
and Princely triumph made,
Six weeks together,
All Nobles that came thither
were entertained and staid,
And when all these pleasant
Sportings quite were done,
the Marquess a Messenger sent
For his young Daughter,
And his pretty smiling Son,
declaring his full intent,
How that the Babes must murdered be,
For so the Marquess did decree:
Come, let me have
the Children, than he said.
With that fair Grissel wept full sore,
She wrung her hands and said no more,
My gracious Lord
must have his will obeyed.
The second part
To the same tune.
depiction of a biblical or apocryphal scene

SHe took the Babies,
Even from the nursing Ladies,
between her tender arms,
She often wishes
With many sorrowful kisses,
that she might ease their harms:
Farewell, farewell
A thousand times my children dear,
never shall I see you again;
It Is long of me
Your sad and woeful mother here,
for whose sake both must be slain;
Had I been borne of Royal race,
You might have been in happy case,
But you must dye
for my unworthiness.
Come messenger of death (quoth she)
Take my dearest Babes to thee,
And to their Father
my complaints express.
He took the Children,
And to his Noble Master
he brought them both with speed,
Who in secret sent them
Unto a Noble Lady
to be brought up indeed.
Then to fair Grissell
With a heavy heart he goes
where she sat mildly all alone,
A pleasant gesture,
And a lovely look she shows,
as if no grief she had known.
(Quoth. he) my children now are slain,
What thinks fair Grissell of the same,
Sweet Grissell now
declare thy mind to me.
Since you, my Lord are pleased with it,
Poor Grissell thinks the action fit,
Both I and mine
at your command will be.
My Nobles murmur,
Fair Grissell at thy honor,
and I no joy can have
Till thou be banished
Both from my Court and presence,
as they unjustly crave,
Thou must be stripped
Out of thy stately garments all,
and as thou came to me
In homely gray
In stead of Bisse and purest Pall,
now all thy clothing must be.
My Lady thou must be no more,
Nor I thy Lord, which grieves me sore,
The poorest life
must now content thy mind.
A groat to thee I must not give,
Thee to maintain while I do live,
Against my Grissell
such great foes I find.
When gentle Grissell
Did hear these woeful tidings,
the tears stood in her eyes,
Nothing she answered,
No words of coffeehouse
did from her lips arise;
Her Velvet Gown
Most patiently she slipped off,
her Kirtle of Silk with the same,
Her Russet Gown
Was brought again with many a scoff
to bear them her self she did frame,
When she was dressed in this array,
And was ready to part away,
God send long life
unto my Lord (quoth she)
Let no offense be found in this,
To give my Lord a parting kiss,
With watery eyes,
farewell my dear, he said.
From Princely Palace,
Unto her Fathers Cottage,
poor Grissell now is gone:
Full sixteen Winters
She lived there contented,
no wrong she thought upon:
And at that time through
All the Land the speeches went,
the Marquess should married be,
Unto a Noble Lady great,
Of high descent,
and to the same all parties did agr^^
The Marquess sent for Grissell fair
The Brides bedchamber to prepare
That nothing therein
might be found awry;
The Bride was with her Brother com^
Which was great joy to all and some
But Grissell took
all this most patiently.
And in the morning,
When as they should be wedded,
her patience then was tried;
Grissell was charged,
Her self in friendly manner,
for to attire the Bride,
Most willingly
She gave consent to do the same,
the Bride in her bravery was dres^
And presently
The Noble Marquess thither came
with all his Lords at his request,
O Grissell, I would ask of thee,
If to this match thou will agree,
Me thinks thy looks
are waxed wondrous coy.
With that they all began to smile,
And Grissell she replide the while,
God send Lord Marquess
many years of joy.
The Marquess was moved
To see his best beloved
thus patient in distress,
He stepped unto her,
And by the hand he took her,
these words he did express,
Thou art my Bride,
And all the Brides I mean to have,
these two thine own children be,
The youthful Lady
On her knees did blessing crave,
her brother as well as she.
And you that envied her estate,
Whom I have made my loving (...)
Now blush for shame,
and honor virtuous life.
The Chronicles of lasting fame
Shall evermore extol the name
Of Patient Grissell
my most constant Wife.
FINIS.
