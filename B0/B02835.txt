THE Winchester Wedding: OR, RALPH of Reading and Black BESS of the Green.
To a new Country Dance: or, The King's Jigg.


AT Winchester was a Wedding,
the like was never seen,
'Twixt lusty Ralph of Reading,
and bonny black Bess of the Green;
The Fiddlers were crowding before,
each Lass was as fine as a Queen,
There was an hundred and more,
for all the whole Country came in;
Brisk Robin led Rose so fair,
she looked like a Lilly of the Vale;
And ruddy faced Harry led Mary,
and Roger led bouncing ^^ll.
With Tommy came smiling Katy,
he help her over the style,
And swore there was none so pretty,
in forty and forty long mile;
Kit gave a green gown to Betty,
and lent her his hand to rise;
But Jenny was jeered by Watty,
for looking blew under the eyes:
Thus merrily chatting all day,
they past to the Bride-house along,
With Iohnny and p^ity faced Nanny,
she fairest of all the Throng.




The Bridegroom came out to meet 'em,
afraid the dinner was spoiled,
And ushered 'em into to treat 'em,
with baked, and roast, and boiled:
The Lads were frollick and jolly,
for each had a Lass by his side;
But Willy was melancholy,
for he had a mind to the Bride:
Then Phillip began her health,
and turned a beer-glass on his thumb;
But Ienkin was reckoned for drinking,
the best in Chrill endom.
And now they had dined, advancing
into the midst of the Hall,
The Fiddlers struck up for dancing,
and Jeremy led up the Brawl;
But Margery kept a quarter,
a Lass that is proud of her pelf,
'Cause Arthur had stolen her garter,
and swore he would tie it himself;
She strugled, she blushed, and frowned,
and ready with anger to cry,
'Cause Arthur with tying her garter,
had slipped up his hands too high.
And now for throwing the Stocking,
the Bride away was led,
The Bridegroom got drunk, was knocking,
for candles to ^ight him to bed;
But Robin that found him silly,
most kindly took him aside,
While that his Wife with Willy
was playing a Whooper's Hide:
And now the warm Game begins,
the critical minute was come,
And chatting, and billing, and kissing
went merrily round the room.
Pert Stephen was kind to Betty,
as blithe as a bird in the spring;
And Tommy was so to Katy,
and wedded her with a rush-ring;
Sukey that danced with the Cushion,
an hour from the room had been gone,
And Barnaby knew by her blushing,
that some other dance had been done:
And thus of fifty fair Maids,
that went to the Wedding with Men,
Scarce five of the fifty was le^t ye,
that so did return again.
Brisk Dolly and prity-fac'd Kate,
this Merriment they did adore;
Each Lass had been pleas^d with her Mate,
as they never had been before:
Nay, Susan was pleased at heart,
she sa^d it, and said it again;
The young Men have played their part,
and no one had cause to complain.
The day was in merriment spent,
the Pipers and the Fiddlers they play,
Before all the Throng, as they went;
thus they made an end of the day.
