TWO LETTERS FROM THE PRESBYTERY of CARRICK-FERGUS, to the Lord Ards, And his
answer to the first of them.
Right Honorable
THe present strange alteration of affairs, moves us to write our mind freely
to your Lordship: Especially since (as it appears now clearly) you have been
the chief author of all these present calamities. We would first put your
Lordship in mind of the hazard you were in before the Covenant was renewed,
and how ye complied with us then for your own safety, with solemnity and
forwardness ye renewed the Covenant, Ye your self first moved and framed a
Declaration in opposition to Malignant courses, and all the present enemies of
the Cause of God. In the propositions to be offered to the King, you agreed
that these concerning Religion, should be first offered, and if these were not
granted, no other should be presented: Your Declaration also bears very large
profession both in general that ye would do nothing in reference to Religion
without our consent and advice, and that least God should leave you to fall in
error, and particularly that ye would acknowledge the Kings Demands, when he
should give satisfaction in securing Religion before he were admitted to the
exercise of his Royal Power, you all along show your self ready to subscibe
all orders against Malignants, and so by ample professions, engadg'd us the
more deeply to give credit to your Declarations, and trust your faithfulness:
Yet nevertheless your Lordship has had secret dealling to bring in
Malignants, and had correspondence with them, and all this time hes been
dealling subtly in your heart, professing one thing, and intending another;
which hes been a most notorious deceit to ensnare the people of God, to advance
your most sinistrous ends, Who could have believed that your Lordship would
have avowed a Commission from the King, when he yet refuses as much as his
Father to secure Religion, but follows wicked counsel, and so avowedly to
violate that Article of your Declaration; or that ye would own a wicked
association of Irish Papists, and under color of strengthening, should have
betrayed that Garrison of Belfast. We must be faithful in warning your
Lordship, (tho the Lord knows what heaviness it is to us) that the Lord will
reward you if ye repent not for such a betraying of the faithful servants of
God, who would have plucked out their eyes for you, and the Lord will visit
your family with sudden ruin, and irreparable desolation for that you have
been so grand an instrument to destroy the work of God here. We exhort your
Lordship in the Name of the living God, to whom ye must give an account, in
haste to forsake that infamous and ungodly course you are in, and adhere to
your former profession, otherwise all the calamities that will ensue, will be
laid on your score. The Lord himself and all the faithful will set themselves
against you, and we will testify of your unfaithfullnesse to the world so long
as the Lord shall give us strength, we shall yet continue to pray for your
Lordships conversion, and shall expect your answer remaining.

At Carrickfergus June 29. 1649. Your Lordships servants in all duty, the
Ministry of the Presbytery.

Reverend Friends,
I Cannot but with unexpressible grief resent the bitter expressions and ill
grounded wrong aspersions you are pleased to cast upon me in your Letter, as if
I had secretly brought in Sir Georg Monroe his party into this Country, and
so have been the chief Author of all these present distractions, whereof God
the searcher of hearts is my witness, I am free (notwithstanding of the
jealousies raised upon some expressions in that Letter of Sir George Monroe to
Sir Robert Stewart which was intercepted) and that among other many prevalent
reasons and motions (too long here to express) inducing at this time to own
his Majesty's commission. It was not the betraying, but the securing of these
Garrisons from Sir George his party; which in our distracted and disjoynted
condition for want of authority, and by reason of the Soldiers affection to
their former Officers were likely to be rendered to him. The Lord he knows that
the preservation of the established Church government your peace, the good and
quiet of this poor corner, and the advancement of Religion according to the
Covenant, (all which by private undermyners to your own knowledge were in
apparent hazard of ruin) are the chief reasons which induces me to this course
of making use of that Authority as the only mean to secure us, (being so united
under command from the violence of opposers hereunto. I request you therefore,
and until my carriage (after that now I am clothed with Authority,) may
witness whether my intentions and resolutions be not according to my
profession, you would be pleased to have more charitable thoughts of me and rest
assured that I am,

Belfast, June 30: 1649. Your affectionatly faithful Friend and Servant,
MONTGOMERY.

Right Honorable,
WE received yours wherein you with grief resent our bitter expressions, and
ill grounded wrong aspersions (as much as to call them false) which you say we
cast upon your Lordship. Truly our expressions flows from the bitterness of
grief and sorrow, and not disaffection toward you: You have often known our
abundant affections, and endeavor to serve your Lordship in our stations.
These which your Lordship calls wrong aspersions, are the words of truth and
soberness, intercepted letters from that party, together with Colonel
Conawayes discovery of that which is now clear, with many other circumstances
of your Lordships latter carriage, and the eexact correspondance between
Colonel Monrors motions and yours dos evince the reality of our assertions as
well as his own letter, which we believe spoke neither affection nor a
conjecture of your Lordships design being written to such a close friend. It is
a sad jest to your Lordship to tell us that it was the securing of these
Garrisons from Colonall George Monroe that moved you to put on that commission;
whereas by the conjunction of your Lordships forces and command, he lies
before this Garrison to destroy it. It were a good proof of the reality of
your purpose: If ye should with your whole power urge him to remove, which if
ye were cordial in, were easy to do. Neither know we how to believe that
your Lordships present course is intended for the good of Religion and the
Covenant, when ye are not only associate with the enemies of both, but your
commission, as we are informed, subjects you to the immediate commands of the
Marquess of Ormond, whose infamous and irreligious peace made with the Rebels,
may easily tell us what establishment to the Covenant, or Presbyteriall
government we may expect from his Orders and Authority, his own printed speech
to the Counsel of Kilkenny, explaines to us his real resolutions concerning
Religion, to maintain Christian Religion in the large extent, and not under a
strict notion of new invented names, and besides the King yet refusing to
secure Religion, how shall you establish it, except ye do very far transgress
the limits of your commission: which we believe you desire no man to think. In
a word your Lordship has but reassumed the old quarrel which the Engadgers
the last year, and before them, James Grahame and the Malignants in England
were of old pursuing: Neither we are confident; will it prosper better in your
hands nor it did in theirs. The Lord in Justice has declared his displeasure
against that course, and will do so against all them who seeks to advance the
King against Christ's throne, and even while he refuses to give Christ his due
first. We would therefore yet again as lovers of the standing of Christ's
King-dome and of your Lordships salvation, as the Messengers of God beseech
your Lordship before you run a furthar hazard of the Lords wrath, to leave off
that ungodly course, and take better means to effectuate the good of Religion
Remember those who honors God he will honor, and these who despise him, shall
be lightly esteemed of: Whereas your Lordship desire our charity toward you:
Truly as we have ever testified a due respectll to your self and family, we
shall yet continue: but you have involved your Lordship already so far in the
guilt of unfaithfulness to the cause of God and your own subscriptions, that
we cannot but testify against the course you are in, and denounce judgment
upon your person, family, and all your party, til the Lord persuade your heart
to return, which shall be our fervent desire, and shall remain,

At Carrickfergus the 2 of July, 1639. Your Lordships servants in all duetifull
observance the Ministers of the Presbytery.
