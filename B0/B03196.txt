The Faithful Mariner:
OR, A Copy of VERSES Writ by a Seaman on Board the Britania in the Streights,
and directed to fair Isabel, his loyal Love, in the City of London.
Tune of, The False-hearted Young Man: or, The Languishing Swain.
FAir Isabel of beauty bright,
To thee in love these lines I write,
Hoping thou art alive and well,
As I am now, as I am now,
Fair Isabel.
On board the brave Britannia bold,
I have the fortune to behold,
The sweet delightful banks of Spain,
While in the Streights, while in the Streights
We do remain.
The Spanish lords of high renown,
And gentery come swarming down,
To see the British royal Fleet,
With swelling sails, with swelling sails,
And streamers sweet.
While we appeared in all our pride,
The seas was never so beautified,
With able men of war before,
Along the streights, along the streights
And Spanish-shore.
We have no storms nor weather foul,
To make the roaring billows roll,
But pleasant breathing gentle gales,
Enough to fill, enough to fill
Our swelling sails.
Along the coast of Barbery,
The Algerine they flocked to see
Our warlike Fleet of royal fame,
And stood amazed, and stood amazed
To see the same.
The longer they the Fleet beheld,
The more they were with wonder filled;
As knowing we were Britains bold,
And that the French, and that the French
Fa^se tales had told.
For Turvil made the Turk believe,
That he no damage could receive;
For of a truth he did declare,
That masters of, that masters of
The seas they were.
This will for truth no longer go,
For Turvil fears great Russel so,
That for Thoulon he stear'd away;
He has not forgot, he has not forgot
The month of May.
With Russel he is loath to deal,
For fear a second warlike peal
Should shake their whole foundation so,
That it might prove, that it might prove
Their overthrow.
Once more my dear and tender dove,
Fair Isabel, my loyal love,
Except of these few lines I send,
Who will remain, who will remain
Your faithful friend.
Tho we are separated now,
I Will not forget that solemn vow,
Made when I left my native land,
To go on board, to go on board
Under command.
Then dearest do not grieve nor mourn,
With patience wait my safe return;
And then we'll both united be,
In lasting bonds, in lasting bonds,
Of loyalty.
The figure of a heart I send,
And round the same these lines are penned:
The chain of love has linked it fast,
So long as l^fe, so long as life
And breath shall last.
