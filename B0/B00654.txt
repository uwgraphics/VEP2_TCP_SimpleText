Sapartons Alarm, to all such as do bear The name of true Soldiers, in
England, or else wheare.
AL Mars his men draw near,
that warlike feats embrace,
Sit down a while, and harken here,
a seruinge Soldiers case.
Lay down the shiuered Spear,
and eke the battered shield,
From Trumpets sound withdraw thine ear,
and hark in open field.
The true complaint of one,
whose gain by service got
Will scarsely yield a hungry Boon,
to cast into the Pot.
If ever warlike wighte,
Has served his time in vain:
In hope to have bin well requighte,
and has received disdain.
In faith then I am he,
such one that for my part
Have ready bin full willinglye,
with hand, and eeke with heart.
To serve my Prince in field,
whiles life had bearing breath,
As one that minded not to yield,
nor forced life or death.
The fiery Cannons thump,
the cragged Scull that riues:
Whose force by inward charge is wont,
to spoil poor Soldiers lives.
Could never force me yet,
the enemies face to shonne:
If Captains courage seemed fit,
the conquest to have won.
And for the time perchance,
I was accepted then,
And promised to have advance,
as soon as other men.
I speak as found I have,
what thoe I am content:
For Saparton now waxes grave,
Some youthful years are spente,
It Is not the curled head,
nor yet the frisled hear:
That courage gives in time of need,
to weld thunweldy Spear.
Some youthful Imps I know,
that bears a passing grace:
If they to pitched field should go,
durst scarsly show their face.
But when that all is don,
It Is manhood makes the man:
Match not the Candell with the Sun,
no praise deserve you than.
If courage craves a fame,
remaining in the breast:
Then manhood needs must make his claim
for to excel the rest.
Though Venus strive with Mars,
to get the upper ground:
At length yet shall the barded Horse,
exceed does Hawk and Hounde.
And Lusty Laddes to you,
let not your courage quell:
Good hap hereafter may ensue,
though I good hap do sell.
Coaste on apace althoe,
Light Horseman trace the soil:
Encounter sharply with thy foe,
Make havoc of the spoil.
Esteem not my ill hap,
Nor weye it ought at all,
The wight that scapes the Cannons clap,
Runs yet to further thrall.
O Mars, bewail thy man,
Because he has such wrong,
In doleful tunes, O rustic Pan,
Now help to wail this song.
So thus my leave I take,
O Soldier now farewell:
No more to do now will I make,
but God preserve Queen EL.
FINIS.
John Saparton.
