The Wanton Wife of Castle-Gate: Or, The Boat-mans Delight.
To its own proper New Tune.




Farewell both Hauk and Hound,
farewell both Shaft and Bow:
Farewell all merry pastimes
and pleasures on a row:
Farewell my best Beloved
in whom I put my trust
For it is neither grief nor sorrow
shall harbor in my breast.
When I was in my prime
and in my youthful days,
Much mirth and merry pastime
and pleasure had always,
But now my mind is charged,
and altered very sore,
Because my best beloved
will fancy me no more.
I loved her, and I proved her,
and I called her my dear;
But alas my beloved
would not let me come near:
I often would have kissed her,
but she always said me nay.
More as ten times have I blessed her
since that she went away.
Tinkers they are Drunkards,
and Masons they are blind,
And Boat-men they make Cuckolds;
because they are used kind
But if you meet a bonny Lass
with black and rolling eyes,
You must kiss her and embrace her,
you may know the reason why.


You must hug her and kiss her
and strive to make her yield,
For a faint-hearted Soldier
did never gain the Field.
So strive to lay her down there
and give the thing you know
And when that she receives it,
she will be loath to let you go.
There lives a Wife in Castle Gate.
but I Will not declare her name;
She is both brisk and buxome,
and fitted for the Game;
She can knip it she can trip it,
as she treads along the Plain;
Till she meet some jolly Boat-man
that will turn her back again.
Her Husband is a quiet man,
and an honest man is he;
And for to wear the Horns sir
contented he must be:
He may wind them at his leisure
and do the best he can,
For his Wife will have her pleasure
with a jolly Boat-man.
At Pomfret Clock and Tower
there is Gold and Silver store;
I have therefore to find her,
and then brave boys we will rore.
We Will drink Sherry and be merry,
we will have beer and ale good store,
And drink to my Lass and thy Lass,
and all good Lasses more.
My love she is a fair one,
and a bonny one is she:
Most dearly do I love her,
her name is Mally.
Her Cheeks are like the Roses,
that blossoms fresh in June,
O she is like some new-strung Instrument
that is newly put in tune.
O my Mally, my honey,
O can thou fancy me,
Then let us to bed haste,
where we will merry be.
For good Gold and Silver
for thee I Will take care
And for a large pairs of Horns
for thy Husband to wear.
You young men and Batchelors
that hears this pretty Jest
Be not of the Opinion
this couple did profess,
But be kind to your wives,
and your sweet-hearts always:
And God will protect you*
by night and by day.
