The Noble Soldiers Advice TO HIS COMRADES: OR, The Red-coats Resolution.
Written by a Member of the Army.
1
WHen honest Red-Coats,
Leave cutting of throats,
And Swords in the Scabards are put.
It then does appear,
Reformat'on draws near,
For that is the way to come to it.
2
I have led the Van,
As a Bandelier-Man,
In Battle we have made the sky burn:
W've brought our Masters,
Through many Disasters,
But now have lest them at Tyburn.
3
True News there is sent,
From the Good Parliament,
That fighting no more we shall see:
Such like Tidings we hear,
With a very good cheer,
For our Army disbanded must be.
4
W've fought like Soldiers
In blood to the shoulders,
In Holland, in Flanders and Spain;
And have likewise in France,
Marched many a Dance;
^et to England com'd safe back again.
5
There Is many of's in
Cold Scotland have been,
And Ireland too many a year;
Nay, and some without spleen,
Jamaicah have seen,
But disbanded now must be here.
6
Many Dangerous times
W've ventured our Limbs,
W've Marched both in Files and in ranks;
But now glad we must be,
If Disbanded I see,
With Pay, and a great many Thanks.
7
We have with a thump,
Confounded the Rump,
And set the King upon his Throne;
We have lived to see,
The Rump hanged on a Tree,
And every man now get his own.
8
Poor Soldiers now,
Must starve, or to Plow,
What course for to live will you take?
there is many of you,
Have no homes to go too,
Pray tell me what shift will you make?
9
Says one, I Have in fears
Been seven long years,
In Holland, in France, and in Spain;
And if now I know not,
How to find out a Plot,
I know the way thither again,
10
'Nother says Brother,
I never could labor,
Now to the Venetians I Will go,
And there make it my work,
To fight with the bold Turk,
There can be no fitter a foe.
11
A third, without Strife,
He Will home to his Wife;
A fourth, his good Kindred will try,
Seeing I have no home,
Abroad I will go rome,
For the devil a Wife have I.
12
Have I spent my years,
In Dangers and Fears,
And shall I go live with a Wife?
Before I will do so,
To the Wars I will go,
And gallantly venture my Life
13
The sixth, at a Word,
He Will mount the Shop-Board,
No more with a Musket he will meddle;
For he now can afford,
To break's old rusty Sword,
To make him a Bodkin and Needle.
14
A Shoemaker I,
A seventh does cry,
Have been, and will follow my Trade,
For since Fighting does fall
I do hope by the Aul,
TO get more than I can by the Blade.
15
Fly brass quoth another,
I tell the dear Brother,
My Tinker-Trade now I intend;
I Will leave off my pillage,
And cry in each Village,
Bowls, Treys, or Old Bellows to mend.
16
But sould'ers indeed,
Take very good heed,
All you that true Batchellours be,
Your Hearts needs not to Throb,
Nor your Hands need not to rob,
For far better days you shall see.
17
To one I Will lay ten,
An Army of Men
Goes over to France the next Spring;
And if you will be
Content, you shall see,
We shall make the Mounsiers to wring.
18
Then lets with one Voice,
Be Glad and Rejoice,
Since Fighting in England does End;
And let him that loves Peace
Get him Home and Increase,
And tell his Sad Tales to his friend.
19
God bless our KING then,
And all the good Men
That be of his Counsel and Court;
And send he may never
Use men that Endeavor
To Ruin a Kingdom for Sport.
20
And without Rebuke
Preserve the good Duke,
Who bravely can lead up the Van;
If even I Fight
For any Man's Right,
Believe me King CHARLES is the Man:
FINIS.
