AN ACT For Securing the PEACE Of the KINGDOM.
Our Sovereign Lord, and the Estates of Parliament, do Ratify and Approve all
Laws and Acts of Parliament made for Securing the Government of the Church as
it is now Established by Law; And for the further Security of the peace of
Church and State, as it is now established; They do hereby Statute and Ordain,
that where any persons who are Tenants, as well in Burgh as Land, or servants
being declared upon the Oath of Calumny of the Informer, shall be found Guilty
or holden as confessed before any competent Judicature for Field-Conventicles; or
for resetting Preachers, who are or shall be Excommunicated, Intercommuned, or
Declared Fugitives upon a Process intented against the said Tennauts and
Servants within three months after committing of the said Crimes, that their
Names, with the Sentence be intimated by the Judge who pronounced the same
under form of instrument, to the Master; if the Delinquent be a servant, or to
the Heritor and Landlord in whose Land or houses he lives, if he be a Tennant
or Cottar; which Master or Heritor shall be obliged within a Month after the
said intimation, either to pay the Delinquents Fine (there being sufficient
Goods to satisfy the same by and attour a years rent to the Master; or if he
have not sufficient Goods, to put him and his Family out of his Land or house,
if he be a Tennant or Cottar; and (if a Servant out of his service) or to
present him to Justice providing always that the Libel, whereupon the foresaid
Sentence proceeded be special as to a certain place where the Field-Conventicle
was kept, or there about and also be special as to the time, viz a certain
day of such a week, or one or other of the days of that week. And his Majesty,
with the Advice and Consent of His Estates of Parliament Declares, that in this
case, it shall be leisum to Heritors to put their Tennants off their Lands, or
out of their Houses possessed by them, at any time of the year; and that
without any Warning or Process of Removing: And not withstanding of any Tacks
set to the Tennants for Years or Terms to run; which in this case are hereby
Declared to be void and null, and the Masters and Heritors are hereby
authorized and allowed to retain as much of the Goods and Geer belonging to the
said Tennants, Cottars and Servants, as may satisfy and pay the last years
Rent due by the Tennant and relieve them of the said Fines.

And His Majesty with consent aforesaid Declares that if any man shall Resett
or Entertain any Servant, Tenant or Cortar who is so put away, he shall be
liable to pay three years fee to the Master who did put him away and three
years duty to the Heritor who put away his Tenant or Cottar, if the said
Tenants or Cottars so put away be Resett or Harbored by any other Heritor as
said is; and likewise be liable in one hundred pounds Scots to be paid to the
King. It is also hereby Statute and Ordained, That the Fines imposed by former
Laws upon Field-Conventicles, shall be doubled, each person being by this Act
Fineable by the former Laws: Except as to Burgesses of Buroughs Royal,
Regality and Barony; who besides the incurring the former Fines for
Field-Conventicles, are for the future to loose their Burgesships, and
Liberties, and to be banished from the Town where they lived, and to the End
that all the Laws against Conventicles may be the better put to Execution, It
is hereby Declared, that it shall be Lawful to His Majesty to Nominate
Sheriff-Deputs, Justices of Peace, or other Commissioners for punishing
Conventicles, and such as are guilty of irregular Marriages, Baptismes and
invading of Ministers.
