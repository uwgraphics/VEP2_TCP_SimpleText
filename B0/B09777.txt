Joy after Sorrow, Being the Sea-mans return from Jamaica: Or, the lovely
Lasses late Lamentation for the long absence of her dearest beloved Friend A
Voyage to Jamaica he pretends:
But at his coming home makes ber amends.
To an excellent new tune, called, my Love is gone to Bohemy, or, wet and weary.

THere was a Maid as I heard tell
which fell in desperation,
She loved a Young Man passing well,
which brought her in vexation:
The Young Man had the Maid beguiled,
the matter so was carried,
For he had gotten her with Child
before that they were married
Which caused this Maid to make great moan,
and often times to speak so,
My belly is up and my heart is down,
and my Love is gone to Jamaica.
He was my joy and hearts delight,
and well my mind contented,
But now he is gone out of my sight,
I sorely am tormented:
Whilst he with me was living here,
heaven knows I loved him dearly,
But now my heart will burst with care,
it touch^th me so nearly.
I sigh I sob* and I make great moan,
the cause wherefore I speak so. etc.

My Love was wondrous kind and free,
when as first he came a woing,
And many good gifts he gave to me,
because he would be doing:
My Love gave me a Beaver Hat,
methought it was br^ve and bonuy,
And a gallant Love-fancy to wear in it,
which cost five pound in money:
but now I weep and make great moan,
the reason why I speak so, etc,
My Love gave me a Silken Gown,
with rich and costly Laces,
There Is not a br^ver in the Town,
it all the rest surpasses:
My Love gave me a gay gold Ring,
and Bracelets made of Amber,
He also gave me a better thing,
when he had me in his Chamber.
I sigh, I sob, and I make great moan,
the reason why I speak so,
My belly is up and my heart is down,
for my Love is gone to Jamaica.

MY love gave me a Holand smock
and bid me for to wear it
One night 'twixt ten and eleven a clock
I Am sure he did not tear it:
My Love gave me a Feather bed,
to lie on when I was weary
On which he had my Maidenhead
when he had made me merry
but since dame fortune she does frown
this makes me sigh and speak so,
My belly is up and my heart is down
and my Love is gone to Jamaica.
And since that time I am possessed,
with many griefs I tell ye
In head, in side in back and breast,
but chiefly in my belly:
Oh that my love were here again,
I Am sure he would befriend me,
And use a means to cure my pain,
and take a course to mend me.
I sigh, I sob, and I make great moan,
the reason why I do so, etc.
If I had Icarus wings to fly,
I do so greatly mind him,
Then I would soon beyond the Seas,
and seek till I could find him,
If that he were in France or Spain.
or else in High Spaniclo.
I Would surely meet with him again,
so closely would I follow.
The Indies and the Wilderness,
and hollow caves I Would seek to.
And every place both more and less,
bel^nging to Jamaica.
Thus many a woeful day and night
the Damsel lay lamenting,
Before her love appeared in sight
to yield her hearts contenting:
But mark what happened at the last
when she so long had mourned,
The bonny Lad that she loved best,
safely from Sea returned.
But when she heard her true-love speak
she knew him by his tongue Sir,
Her heart did in her belly leap,
and about his neck she flung Sir.
Good Lord what kissing there was then;
with friendly kind embraces,
Until the joyful tears of them
ran down each others faces:
The very night when this was done
as is for certain spoken,
She was delivered of a Son,
a fair and goodly token,
Whereby she alters s^on her tune,
her fancy made her speak so,
My heart is up and my belly is down,
and my Love is come from Jamaica.
Soon after that the Seaman bold,
he having of money plenty,
Cast in her lap ten pound in gold.
and half crown pieces twenty:
And since that time they married are,
whereby their joys are double,
And now she sings with a merry cheer,
being free from care and trouble.
My sorrows all are past and gone,
which makes me sing and speak so,
My heart is up and my belly is down,
and Love is come from Jamaica.
