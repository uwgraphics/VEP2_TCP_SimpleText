The seven sovereign medicines and Salues, to be diligently applied to the
seven deadly wounds and sores.
Pride, and Humility.
PRide is the first and chiefest sore,
the worst of other seven:
And Meeknes is a salve therefore,
the chiefest under heaven.
Envy, and Love.
Envy is the second sore,
that ranckleth as a Byle:
Keep perfect Love, a salve therefore,
to help it in a while.
Wrath, and Charity.
WRath likewise is the third sore,
with Rigour^ (...) of heart:
Charity is a salve therefore,
which will thee soon convert.
Sloth, Watching and Prayer.
Sloth also is the fourth sore,
which hurts small and great:
Watching and Prayer's a salve therefore,
which any man may get.
Gluttony, and Temperance.
GLuttony is the fifth foul sore,
which many men does grieve:
True Te^perance is a salve therefore,
which will them soon relieve.
Covetousness, and Liberality.
Covetousness is the sixth sore,
that builds in every street:
Liberality is a salve therefore,
but few with it can meet.
Lechery, and Chastity.
LEchery is the seventh sore,
that works shame each where:
Chastity is a salve therefore,
but often this salve is dear.
TAke up these seven sovereign salues,
and bi^^ each salve to sore^
And then the seven stinking sores
shall never grieve thee more.
