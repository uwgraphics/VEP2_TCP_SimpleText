Britain and Irelands last adieu
To Rome, and Babels cursed crew.

SInce Jock and Jack by happy chance
are joined in amity:
You popish Monsieurs march to France,
you Dons to Castalee.
Let Romish frogs return to Rome,
and mean them to the Pope:
If here they haunt, expect a doom
no better nor a rope.
Our Irish Shane with weeping eye,
mones he loved Rome so long:
And now to God and Britain he
regraits his woes and wrong,
Entreating them for Christ's blessed wounds,
that he relieved may be
From errors pits wherein he swouns
least blinded there he die.
For why? in Turkey, Rome, nor Spain
was not such crueitie,
Nor for God Saints such barbarous pain,
such shame and misery.
Such grinding of the poor ones face,
such plots of Church and State,
Unpunished were in no place,
as in our land of late.
Trueman to God and to his King,
did at Knockfergus die;
And there a spectacle did hing,
whiles traitors honored be.
March on brave Jock, thy lot is so,
Gods game for to begin:
To free thy self and brethren two
from that proud man of sin.
Jack use thy time, and busy be
to chase these frogs a way,
And with brave Jock bear company
who will thee lend a day.
At Tyne he will on thy service stay,
while thou well satled be:
And for Schans sake alongs the wa^
to Dublin march with thee.
Those Romish Brambles to root out,
which have overgrown that land,
And Wentworths weeds to dig about,
which in Christ field there stand.
And when brave Jock returns from Tyne,
and Schane from Rome set free,
Jock will with Jack march to the Rhyne
the Palsgraves bounds to see.
There to avenge the woes and wrong
of our Eli^a fair,
Whose Princely race horn down so long
is by the Spainiard there.
I hope our Lion once will wake,
and with his Libbards strong,
His Sisters race to take to heart
his Martial thoughts among.
The pricking Thissle shall convoy
Christ's Ensigns to those bounds:
And Hibers Harps with greatest joy
shall warble forth their sounds.
O if that blessed Day would daw,
which Jock and Jack would see,
Then they with courage in a raw
should march to Germany.
To clip the Eagles soaring wings,
and curb in pride full ^^ pain:
Then he as God in Rome who reigns
shall fall, not rise again.
The Lord who has this work begun,
make it pertlied be;
And when these troublous times are done
end Sions misery.
Amen quoth he, who prays these three
By God conjoined in unity,
May still in one Religion
Fear God, under one tripled Crown:
That Dag^^ here as he has been
May near Gods ark no more be seen.
