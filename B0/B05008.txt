To the Tune of, Robin Hood and the Stranger.


COme Gentlemen all, and listen a while,
with hey down, down and a down;
And a story I Will to you unfold.
I Will tell you how Robin Hood served ye Bishop
When he robbed him of his Gold.
As it ^ell (...) in a Sun-shining day,
with a hey, etc.
When Phoebus was in his prime;
then Robin Hood, that Archer good,
In mirth would spend some time.
And as he walked the Fortest along,
with a hey, etc.
Some Pastime for to spy,
there was he wa^^ of a proud Bishop,
And all his Company.
O what shall I do, said Robin Hood then?
with a hey, etc.
If the Bishop he does take me,
no mercy he will show, unto me I know,
But hanged shall I be.
Then Robin was stout, and turned him about,
with a hey, etc.
And a little House there he did spy:
and to an Old Wife, for to save his life,
He aloud began to cry.
Why, who art thou, said ye Old Woman,
with a hey, etc.
Come tell it to me for good.
I am an Outlaw, as many do know,
My Name it is Robin Hood.
And yonder is the Bishop and all his man,
with a hey, etc.
And if that I taken be,
then day and night, he will work me spite,
And hanged shall I be.
If thou be Robin Hood, then said ye Old wife
with a hey, etc.
As thou do seem to me;
I Will for thee provide, and thee I will hide,
From the Bishop and his Company:
For I remember on Saturday night,
with a hey, etc.
Thou bought me both wh^^es and Hose:
therefore I Will provide. thy person to hide,
And keep thee from thy Foes.
Thou give me soon thy Coat of Gray,
with hey down, down and a down.
And take thou my Mantie of Green;
thy Spindle and Twine, unto me resign,
And take thou my Arrows so keen.


ANd (...) Robin Hood, ^^s thus arrayed
with hey down down and a down,
He went straight to his Company,
with his Spindle and Twins, he a^t looked behind,
For the Bishop and his company.
O who is yonder, quoth Little John,
with a hey down, etc.
That now comes over the Lee:
an Arrow at her I will let fly,
So like an Old Witch looks she.
O hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin then
with hey, etc.
And shoot not thy Arrows so keen,
I am Robin Hood, thy Master good,
And quickly it shall be seen.
The Bishop he came to the Old Woman's house,
with hey, etc.
And he called with furious mood.
come let me soon see, and bring unto me,
That Traitor Robin Hood.
The Old Woman he set on a Milk White Steed,
with hey, etc.
Himself on a D^pple Gray.
and for ^ Robin Hood,
H^ (...) the way.
But (...) Riding the fortest along
with hey etc.
(...) to see,
(...) men bold,
(...) under (...) Green-wood free.
O who (...) yo^^er, the Bishop then said,
with hey, etc.
That Is ranging within yonder Wood?
marry says the old woman, I think it to be
A man called Robin Hood.
Why, who art thou, the Bishop he said,
with hey, etc.
Which I have here with me?
why I am a woman, thou Cuckol^ly Bishop
Lift up my Leg and see.
Then woe is me, the Bishop he said,
with hey, etc.
That ever I saw this day,
he turned him about, but Robin Hood is stout,
Called him and bid him stay.
They Robin took hold of the Bishops Horse,
with hey, etc.
And tied him fast to a Tree:
then Little John, smiled his Mastat upon,
For joy of his Company.
Robin Hood took his Mantl^ from's back,
with hey, etc.
And (...) the Gr^und,
and out (...) Bishops Portmantle, he
So^n told (...) hund^^^ pound.
Now let him go, said Robin Hood,
with hey, etc.
Said Little John that may not ^e,
for I vow and protest he shall sing us a Mass,
Before that he go from me.
Then Robin Hood took the Bishop by the hand
with hey, etc.
And bound him fast to a Tree,
and made him sing a Mass, God-w^t,
To him and his Yeomandry.
And when they brought him through the wood
with hey down, down and a down.
And set him an his Dapple Gray.
and gabs the Tail within his hand,
And bade him for Robin Hood pray.
