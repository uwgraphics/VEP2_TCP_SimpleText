On His Majesty's most Gracious and Prudent Delivery of the Great Seal of
England to the Right Honorable Sir HENEAGE FINCH Knight and Baronet His late
AttornyGeneral.
CEase, Cease, (fond Age) give over to complain:
Leave off your murmurings, and griefs disdain.
Papists, Fanatics, all ill Sects must down,
None but the pure must now approach the Crown.
Our King like a wise Builder Now has shown
What Stones 'twas fit to use, and what to own.
Alas! Great Kings and States must often do
Things which necessities do urge them to;
But when those great necessities are past,
The Sun shows forth its own true Beams at last.
What Loyal Heart will not rejoice to hear,
That Loyalty runs once more regular?
(Our Liberties are kept by Cavaleir.
The Church secure, then who can fear a State,
That h^th a Supporter so fortunate?
Wise, Just and Eloquent, but to express
His many Vi^tues would but make them less.
He Is known so well, 'twere needless to set forth,
Or more to say, then that he is risen by's worth.
His Praise most due,'it is folly to proclaim,
All know his Praise who have but heard of's Name,
He wants no Character who'th so much fame,
Oh happy Seal, with such a trusty Friend!
May there be no divorse till life does end;
May the Seal never be superseeded here,
Till Heaven commands the Keeper to come there:
And may Heavens Messenger prove very slow
In pity to us; who are left below.
The Church, the State, all must confess 'twas fit
To have the Seal for Finch, and him for it.
No halting lines, none but true Eloquence
Must be spoke here, or sent abroad from hence.
No swelling State, must now o'relook our Head,
The Keepers looks can strike a Province dead.
Long may he live to give our King content,
And be endeared to his Parliament
May we never want to rule the Commonweal
A Stewart, or a Finch to keep the Seal.
By a well wisher to King and Country.
Printed in the Year MDCLXXIII.
