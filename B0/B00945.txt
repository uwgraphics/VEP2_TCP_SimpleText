Notable Textes of the scriptures which declare of what virtue strength and
holiness the pixed or boxed God is: with also / what faith / hope and confidence
is to be put in him.

Baruch. vi. If he may putrify or be consumed of worms / moulde, rust beast
or fire: he is an Idol and no God.

THat same spyrite (dear brethern) which moved S. Paul to reprove the Cytezens
of Athe^s for their ydolatry / Act. Act. xiij. c.
xvij c. Has also moved us to warn you by the scriptures of the same offense
specially in worshipping that unknown God on ye altar / which thing you do
ignorauntly / and therefore we certify and assure you by this present That God
which made the world / and all that therein is, 3. Reg. 8. d 2. Par. 6. c Esaias.
lxv. Act. xij. f. Heb. ix. c.
dwells not in temples made with hands: neither is he daily offered upon
your coniured aulters. Heb. ix. c.
For then should he often have suffered sens the world began. But that did he
ones for all, wha^ he offered up himself. Heb. ix. e.
And with that only sacrifice has he made perfect for ever al them that are
sanctified. Heb. vij. d. Heb. x. c.
But now to our purose / sei^g / Christ is not in your church made with hands
(as these foresaid scriptures will witness unto you) how can you avoyde
ydolatrye in giving that worship to an earthly thing which is only due unto
God? is not bread an earthlye thing, and has not the hands of sinners made
and fashioned it for your purpose? why do ye than worship it? And if you say it
is no substance of bread. But the lykenes thereof after the consecracio^
(which is a blasphemous lie) what win you by that? Exo. xx. a. Deuteronomy. v. a
for God said / you shall not worship the lykenes of any thing in heaven or in
earth. But here peradventure some wilier then his fellows / will say, we
neither worship the substance of bread nor the likeness of bread, but we
worship Christ contained in the bread. To answer this vipers whelp^, we say
that the natural body of Christ is nether contained in the bread / in the
church nor in the hole earth as we have proved before / neither wills he to
be worshipped in bread nor wine / but in spirit and truth. John. 4. e.
Neither can ye worship Christ where he is not, but where he is / that is in
heaven. For that same natural body which Christ took of the virgi^ mary which
suffxed death / wc rose again which ascended into heaven sits now on the
right hand of his father, and if you will not believe us herein, search these
scriptures following. Psalm x. c. xiij. b. Eccle. v. a. Job. xvi. d Esaias. lxiiij.

Might not these if you were men and not beasts / persuade you to the truth
and cause your conscience to confess the abominable ydolatry with earnest
repentance for the same. Luc. 24. c.
Oh ye foles and slow of heart to believe ye scriptures. If we say the truth why
do ye not believe us? John. viij Act. xiij. b
Oh ye children of ye deuell will you never cease to pervert the straight ways
of the lord? John 12 a
will you still say you have Christ / and he says you have me not? Will you God
/ like as they do with other ydols / By this might you know says Jeremy yt it
is no god. Baru. 6. c.
Yea / do not rats and mise devour and eat your God / and time consume and
putrify your god / but what you do with hi^ after few men may know. Shall the
natural body of Christ which was the only price of our redemption be
eaten of rats or mise? Or may time consume the high priest which remains for
ever. Oh you priests of bell / be ones ashamed of your lie^g / for truly if
daniell may ones speak freely with the king / he will bewray your false
iugli^g. Heb. vi.
That it may be so and that shortly we pray. Let no man judge us that we may
any thing herein derogate ye holy Supper of Christ / for that we must highlye
esteem as the perfight memorial of our redemption and most necessary food
of our souls. i. corin. x.
Eating and drinking therein the very body and blood of christ even as our
