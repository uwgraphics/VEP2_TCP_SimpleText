CUPIDS COURT of EQUITY.
The scornful Lady quickly took,
While she her love Disdained:
She was pricked down in Cupids Book,
His Vassal she remained.
Tune of, When first I bid my Love Good Morrow.




WHen first I bid my Love good morrow,
with tear in Eye, and hand on breast;
My heart was even drowned in sorrow,
and I poor soul was much oppressed.
The glances from her Eye so darted,
I her captive soon was made;
The Prisoner took was brokenhearted,
this I find is Cupids Trade.
All my reason then was banished.
and I left in Captivity:
My hoped for joys were quickly vanished,
by the Lightning of her Eye.
All my hopes at once were blasted,
by one seeming scornful look:
The joys I hoped for to have tasted,
had no Record in Cupids Book.
I sighed, I groun'd just like a Lover,
ready just for to depart;
And had no hopes for to recover.
for she, Oh she had broke my heart.
Away I went without her smiling,
which was worse then death to me:
And Cupid was me then beguiling
of my Life and Liberty.




BUt when she see that I absented,
almost melted into Tears,
By Love sick case she then lamented,
and like my self was filled with fears.
Alas, quoth she, am I so cruel,
as to let this Lover dye?
Or to his flames to add such fuel,
as makes his heart to scorch and fry,
A Balsome then I will provide him,
shall effect a perfect cure;
And in my bosom I will hide him,
he shall not these pains endure.
My thinks I feel my self relenting,
and in tears I almost melt:
Now do I grieve at his tormenting,
I now feel the pains he felt.
None can endure this bitter anguish,
which at this time I do feel:
For want of him I grieve, I languish,
none but he my wounds can heal.
Let not your beauty make you peevish,
you that nature made so fair:
For men's as women's eyes are thievish,
love commands or breeds despair.
At first too strangely I did slight him,
whom I now so much adore:
He is the Man I do delight in,
and now will do for evermore.
His sighs and groans shall be requited,
with a shoure of brackish tears:
And my senses are benighted,
filled with storms of dreads and fears.
Oh come again before my soreow
brings me to the brink of Death,
I cannot hope to see to morrow,
except you come to save my breath.
Then come and take thy conquest quickly
I am ready to depart:
Just at this moment I am sickly,
thou have won my tender heart.
FINIS.
