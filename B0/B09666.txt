WHEREAS I have received notice, that (according to Orders given) there will be
within this University and City of OXON. strict Guards kept and observed by his
Majesty's Forces that are now in this Place, as the same are kept and observed
in most other Places at this time: As well for the satisfaction, quiet and
safety of His Majesty's Subjects as to prevent any Dangers: These are therefore
to give warning to all Persons, as well of the University and City of OXON as
others herein concerned, That such care will be taken and Watches duly
observed and executed, as also to Will and Require that no Person or Persons
appear abroad at night, especially after the Tattoo, except upon very
extraordinary occasions, and that rarely. And if any Person shall (on what
occasion soever) be taken or apprehended by the said Guards, That none presume
to give any uncivil answer or affront to the Guard or Officers, but that they
behave themselves orderly and respectfully under pain of being severely
punished according to the offense, as often as any breach of the peace, or
other misdemeanour shall so deserve and require it.
