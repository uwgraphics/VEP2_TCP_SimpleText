A TRUE RLLATION OF A most strange and wonderful Tempest which happened on the
29th of June 1680. at Newtown-Stewart in Ireland as it was communicated in a
Letter by a Gentleman to his friend in London
THere happened near this place so strange and so sad an accident that I think
the like has been seldom known. On Saturday last about ten of the Clock in
the day, we heard much Thunder within 15 miles from hence, made many great
breaches in a Mountain, and such spouts of water fell upon the places so broken
up, that the Flood hurriried the loossened Earth with it to the bottom, and
swelled a Brook which ran there, and comes into the Rivers by this place, so
suddenly that it carried away all that stood before it, People who lived near
the Bauck had not time to get out of their houses, but their goods, houses and
all were swept along with it and perished, the Beast that fed near it were
lost, the very Fish were stifled by the Earth which the Current brought with it
great quantities of Salmon, Trouts, and Lamperies, which Inever saw here
before, even the Eeles that live in the Mud were choked and thrown dead upon
the Shore, and I do not believe there is one Fish alive in the River from the
Mountains to the Sea, my curiosity took me yesterday to the place where this
Deluge began, and truly I was amazed to see a Mountain torn in above ten
several places and all the low Ground by the River for ten miles together,
covered with the Ruins the Cornfieldsd buried, and the people poking in the
mud and Earth for the Bodies of their Friends and of their Cattle I cannot yet
learn exactly how many have perished but by the accounts that are given there
are lost in several places fifty Souls and abundance of Cattle.
