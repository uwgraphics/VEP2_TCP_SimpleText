THE Lusty Lad of London: OR, The pleasant Wooing betwixt brawny Will a Wine
Cooper, and a wealthy Merchant's fair Widow.
To the Tune of, A Soldier and a Sailor.
COme listen to this Ditty,
Not far from London-City,
There lived a lusty Lover,
Who happened to discover
a Widow lined with Gold,
a Widow, etc.
Resolved he was to Woe her,
And when he did come to her,
He told her in his Breeces,
There was the best of Riches,
right pleasant to behold,
right pleasant, etc.
The Widow was offended,
And straight her Brows she bended,
Crying, You saucy Villain,
I would not give a Shilling
for all that ever you have,
for all that, etc.
I am an honest Woman,
Your Harlots loose and common
May like of that expression;
I Will punish your transgression,
you saucy, saucy Slave,
you saucy, etc.
Sweet, Madam, be not froward,
Why are you so untoward?
Resolved I am to Marry,
And will no longer tarry,
if you will be my Bride,
if you will, etc.
Why should Emince the matter?
Or stand to cog and flatter,
That Riches out of measure,
Will yield a Woman pleasure,
yet I have Land beside,
yet I have, etc.
I doubt it is but a story,
When thus you seem to glory,
In such a double Potion;
If once you gain Promotion,
perhaps abroad you will run,
perhaps abroad, etc.
To mincing Sue, or Nancy,
Placing your Love on Fancy,
On wanton London Misses,
while they enjoy your Kisses,
poor I shall be undone,
poor I shall, etc.
No, no, thou need'st not fear me,
Be pleased how to hear me,
I Will mind no other Beauty,
But still perform my Duty
to thee my lawful Wife,
to thee, etc.
And therefore Dearest try me,
Do not the least deny me,
I Will labor to delight thee,
And for thy Love requite thee
with a contented Life,
with a, etc.
When he had this related,
Her Anger was abated,
Then she replied, My Jewel,
I cannot be coy and cruel,
as many others can,
as many, etc.
Thy Words are so prevailing,
That now my former railing
Is turned to Love's desire,
Thy person I admire
because thou art a Man,
because thou, etc.
His Complyments were slender,
Nor did he ever send her
Rich Present to, obtain her,
Yet had the luck to gain her,
with all her Riches too,
with all, etc.
For by his down right dealing,
He brought the sense of Feeling
Upon her, in a minute,
She could not stand again in it:
see what a Man can do,
see what, etc.
