Ragged, and Torn, and True.
Or* the poor man's Resoltion,
To the tune of Old Simon the King.


I Am a poor man, God knows,
and all my neighbors can tell.
I want both money and clothes,
and yet I live wondrous well:
I have a contented mind,
and a heart to bear out all,
Though Fortune (being unkind)
has given me substance small.
Then hang up sorrow and care,
it never shall make me rue:
What though my back goes bare?
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
I scorn to live by the shift,
or by any sinister dealing.
I Will flatter no man for a gift,
nor will I get money by stealing.
I Will be no Knight of the Post;
to sell my soul for a bribe,
Though all my fortunes be crossed,
yet I scorn the Cheaters tribe.
Then hang up sorrow and care,
it never shall make me rue,
What though my cloak be threadbare,
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
A Boot of Spanish leather.
I have seen set fast in the stocks,
Exposed to wind and weather,
and foul reproach and mocke^.
While I in my poor rags,
can pass at liberty still:
O fie on these brawling bragges,
when the money is gotten so ill.
O fie on these pelfering knaves,
I scorn to be of that crew.
They steal to make themselves brave,
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
I have seen a Gallant go by,
woth all his wealth on his back,
He looked as loftily,
as one that did nothing lack,
And yet he has no means,
but what he gets by the sword,
Which he consume on Queanes,
for it thriues not take my word:
Oh fie on these highway thieves,
the Gallows will be then due:
Though my doublet be rent ith sleeves
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
The Second Part.
To the Same Tune.


SOme do themselves maintain,
with playing at cards and Dice,
O fie on that lawless gain,
got by such wicked vice:
They coozen poor Contrymen,
with their delusions vilde,
Yet it happens now and then,
that they are themselves beguilde:
For if they be caught in a snare,
then the Pillery clames its due,
Though my Ierkin be worn and bare
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
I have seen some gallants brave,
up Holborne ride in a Cart,
Which sight much sorrow gave
to every tender heart:
Then have I said to my self,
what pity is it for this,
That any man for pelf,
should do such a foul amiss:
O fie on deceit and theft,
it makes men at the last rue,
Though I have but little left,
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
The Pick-pockets in a throng,
at a Market or a Fair.
Will try whose purse is strong
that they may the money share:
But if they are caught ith action,
they are carried away in disgrace.
Either to the house of Correction,
or else to a worser place:
O fie on these pelfering Thieves,
the Gallows will be their due,
What need I suee for a repreeue^,
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
The Hostler, to maintain
himself with money ins purse,
Approues the Proverb true,
and says Gramercy Horse:
He robs the traveling beast,
that cannot divulge his ill,
He steals a whole handful at least,
from every half peck he should fill,
O fie on those coozening scabs,
that rob the poor Iades of their due
I scorn all thieves and Drabs:
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
It Is good to be honest and just,
though a man be never so poor,
False dealers are still in mistrust,
their afraid of the officers door:
Their conscience does them accuse
and the quake at the noise of a bush:
While he chat does no man abuse,
For the ^aw needs not care a rush,
Then welfare the man that can say,
I pay every man his due,
Although I go poor in array,
I Am ragged, and torn, and true.
FINIS.
