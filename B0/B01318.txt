MDCLXVI. A Prognostic on this Famous Year 1666. Or, The Number of the Beast,
so much talked of, Dialogue-wise, Chronogrammatically Explained.
WOE to the Year, in which three Sixes meet!
It does Portend Disaster to some Fleet;
Some King to be overthrown; some State dispersed;
Some Laws Eradicated and Reversed.
Quest.
THen tell me, Fatal Year, What King's foreshown,
Or here donoted to be overthrown?
Answ.
If that you would this Mystery unfold,
You may in LVDoVICVs him behold.
Quest.
Tell me, What State shall be dispersed? and Who,
By scattering their Folk, shall it undo?
Answ.
The King of England, if you will believe
The Comets, shall the Hogen-Mogens drive.
Quest.
Tell me, What Laws then shall be rooted out?
And by whose means this shall be brought about?
Answ.
The unjust Laws of Holland shall go down;
And their Nefarious Plots quite overthrown.
And this, by the Industry, Pains, Care, and Charge,
Of Munsters Bishop, shall be done at large.
ANd yet, for further Satisfaction,
Look into St. John's Revelation:
And there you shall this read:
Rev. 13.18. Here Wisdom is,
And he that understands, if, not amiss,
He counts the Number of the Beast, shall find
It to the Number of a man inclined.
For so it is: and then your thoughts to fix,
The Number is SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SIX:
Which with the French Kings Name if you compare,
The Number both with Beast and Man will square.
LVDoVICVs.

Lewis (the 14.) of FranCe AnD NaVarre.
