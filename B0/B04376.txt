To an Excellent New Tune, much in request.

OH Mother! Roger with his kisses,
almost stops my breath I vow,
Why does he gripe my hand to pieces
and yet he says he loves me too:
Tell me Mother, pray now do,
pray now do, pray now do,
Tell me mother, pray now do,
Pray now, pray now, pray now do,
What Roger means when he does so,
for never stir, I long to know.
Nor yet besides he will not let me,
settle to my wheel and spin
But upon his knee will set me,
mother when you an't within,
Tell me mother, etc.
Although I vow he does provoke me,
yet he will not once forbear,
But most tenderly did stroke me,
till he makes me blush I swear:
Tell me Mother, pray now do,
pray now do, pray now do,
Tell me mother, pray now do,
Pray now, pray now, pray now do,
What Roger means when he does so,
for never stir, I long to know.




Thus whilst he talks of pure affection,
Roger on my breast he leans,
Mother give me your direction,
for I know not what he means:
Tell me mother, etc.
And what he said concerning Wooing
now I clearly have forgot,
Yet he fain would have been doing
something but I know not what:
Tell me mother, etc.
Although I am both coy and fickle,
yet he calls me his delight,
And my sides he does so tickle,
that he makes me laugh outright:
Tell me mother, pray now do,
pray now do, pray now do;
Tell me mother, pray now do,
Pray now, pray now, pray now do,
What Roger means when he does so,
for never stir I long to know.
The Mothers direction to her Daughter; Together with Rogers Loyalty.
Dear Daughter that you may not miscarry,
Rogers courage never cool.
Till you marry make him tarry,
pray now take your mothers rule:
My dear Daughter, pray now then,
pray now then, pray now then,
Maids are too much slighted when,
They have yielded to Young Men,
For they can flatter, cog and lie,
and all their promises deny.
But if his love be so entire,
when the Nuptial Bands are tied,
You may yield to his desire,
being made his lawful Bride:
If you cannot this obtain,
this obtain, this obtain,
Then his company refrain,
With your Scorn and high disdain,
For should you grant him his delight,
then Daughter you are ruined quite.
But Roger he was something near them
in a corner mighty mute,
Where he chanced to over hear them,
while they were in this dispute:
Notwithstanding what he heard,
what he heard, what he heard,
For a while he never appear d,
But at last the case he cleared,
And told them that he did suppose,
they did not think him one of those.
Now when her Mother found him loyal,
by his honest fair intent,
Then there needed no denial,
soon she gave her free consent,
That her Daughter should be wed,
should be wed, should be wed,
To his lawful bridal bed,
All her fears was fully fled;
Then many Damsels fair and gay,
did come to celebrate the day.
FINIS.
