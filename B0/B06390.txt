AMongst the Forresters of old,
one Thomas of great fame;
A Champion great, both stout and bold,
Lord Thomas was his name.
In shooting too his aim was good,
the Kings Deer he did slay,
He did excel bold Robin Hood,
and often won the day.
Lord Thomas as they did him call,
with beauteous Elener,
So deep in love did chance to fall,
he could love none but her.
She also loved him as well,
and no love there was lost;
But mark what afterward befell,
both in their loves were crossed.
This Elener that was so fair,
no portion had at all;
Lord Thomas if be come but near,
would always on her call.
Lord Thomas had a Mother who
his love did understand,
She made him swear he would nothing do
unless she did command.
He promised her he would obey,
and hearken to her voice;
Therefore desired her for to say,
where he should make his choice.
Oh Son, quoth she, this Elener,
is fair enough it is true;
And thou ma^st chance to beg with her,
such matches fit not you.
I know a pretty black-brow'd Lass,
though not so handsome quite;
She her in wealth does far surpass
which will give thee delight.
Well Mother, since it is your will,
Lord Thomas humbly said,
I straight way will the same fulfi^l,
and Marry the Black-brow'd Maid.
This thing did much his Mother please,
and so she went away;
But Lord Thomas he could find no ease,
by night, nor yet by day.
He on the morrow mounts his steed,
and to Elener did ride,
His Lovesick heart with grief did bleed,
to think what would betide.
When to fair Elener he was come,
he knocked hard at the gate;
The fearful Virgin being at home,
asked who 'twas knocked so late.
It Is I fair Elener my dear,
his voice she streight-way knew:
And as soon as e're she heard him there,
the gates straight open flew.
Lord Thomas uttered then his mind,
and with great grief he cried,
My Mother to me is unkind,
and has gotten me a new Bride.
You to my Wedding I invite,
and I must not be denied;
They crying kissed, then bid good night,
and Lord Thomas away did ride.
Fair Elener with grief and woe.
was stricken almost dead,
She to her Mother straight did go,
and told her what he said.
She asked her Mother leave to ride
to see if he had got,
Instead of her, another bride,
for she believed him not.
Her Mother would not give her leave,
that she should go to see,
But she her Mother did deceive,
and slipped out privately.
She clothed her servants all in green,
and with her they all did ride,
She did excel beauties fair Queen,
in all her glorious pride.
When to Lord Thomas she was come,
she asked to see his Bride,
He took her into a private room,
where both together cried.
He bid her look at that window,
for there she might be seen,
Methinks quoth she, good sir, you know
I am to her a Queen.
Her self to Murder she was bent,
and turning to a bed,
A Dagger to her heart she sent.
and straight way fell down dead.
Lord Thomas seeing she was slain,
the self same Dagger took;
He vowed in Heaven her to obtain,
then to his heart he struck.
Let Parents therefore have a care,
how that they do deny
Their childrens choice, lest that they share,
those lovers destiny.
