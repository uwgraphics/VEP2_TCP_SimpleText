WHen God for sin, to plage has me^t
Although, he long defarde
He tokens truly, strange has sent
To make his foes a fearde.
That they thereby, might take remorce
Of their ill life misspent
And more of love, then fear or force
Their formal faults repent.
Before the earth was overflowed
With waters huge throughout
He sent them Noe, that holy one
Who daily went about.
To call them then, to Godly life
At whom they laughte and fumde
He was contemde of man and wife
Till they were all consumde.
Loath did preach most earnestly
But it did not prevail:
Then fire and brymstone verily
Upon them down did hayle.
Pharaoes heart had no remorce
Though wounders strange he saw
But rather was therefore the worce
Without all fear or awe.
Until both he and his therefore
By justice sent of God
In raginge seas, were all forlore
And then he felt the rod.
Ten times truly were the Jews
In captive brought and led
Before each time, it God did use
His tokens strange we red.
The year before Vaspatian came
The Jews a heyfer dressed
Which being slain, did calue a lame
This sign they sone did wrest,
As others do, and still have done
In making it as vain
Or else good luck, they say shall come
As please their foolish brain.
The Heathen could forese and say
That when such wounders were
It did foreshew to them always
That some ill hap drew nere.
The scripture says, before the end
Of all things shall appear
God will wounders strange things sends
As some is seen this year.
The selye infantes, void of shape
The Calves and Pigs so strange
With other mo of such mishape
Declares this worlds change.
But here, lo, see above the rest
A Monster to behold
Procedinge from a Christian breast
To monstrous to be told.
No Caruer can, nor Paynter may
The same so ougly make
As does it self show at this day
A sight to make the quake.
But here thou haste by Printing art
A sign thereof to se
Let each man say within his heart
It preaches now, to me.
That I should seek to live henceforth
In Godly life always
For these be tokens now sent forth
To preach the later day.
Also it does demonstrate plain
The great abuse and vice
That here in England now does raygne
That Monstrous is the guyse.
By readinge stories, we shall find
In scripture, and else where
That when such things came out of kind
Gods wrath it did declare.
But if we lightely weye the same
And make but nine days wonder
The Lord our stoutnes, sone will tame
And sharply bring us under.
Then ponder well betymes, long past
The sequel of such signs
And call to God by prayer in have
From sin to change our minds.
Repent, amend both high and low
The word of God embrace
To live thereto, as we should do
God give us all the grace.
