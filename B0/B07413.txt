To the Reader.
SOothing and Crossing are two humors more troublesome than profitable, The
one troubles the wise that love no flattery, and the other fools that love to
be flattered. What you are I know not, and therefore as you find your self,
so fit your sense: And yet if you will not scorn a fools counsel, be silent
rather than cross, for fear of quarrels; and rather learn silence among the
wise, than sooth their sayings in their hearing, for their ears are jealous
over their wits. But lest I make a great entry to a little house, leaving what
you read to your leisure, and the liking to your capacity, I rest.
