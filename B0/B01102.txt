O Mighty fader in heaven on hye
One god and persons three
That made both day and night
And after as it was thy will
Thy nowne sone thou sent us till
In a maiden to light
Sith the Jews that were wild
Hanged him that was so mylde
And to death him dyght
When he was deed the sothe to say
To life he rose on the third day
Thorughe his own might
Then to hell he went anon
And took out souls many one
Out of that hold he hent
Maugre the fendes that were bold
He took the prisoners out of hold
With them to heaven he went
On his faders right hand he him set
That all should know withouten let
That he was omnypotente
And after wisdom he was sent
That all should keep his commaundemen
And for to believe in him verray
That is our sauyoure
That borne was of that blyssed flower
That hight Mary I say
That shall us deem withouten mysse
Some to pain and some to bliss
It dread full domes day
The lady commaun^ed anon soon
That the gates were undone
And bring them all before me
For well at ease shall they be
They took their pages horse and all
These two men went in to the hall
Ipomydon on knees him set
And the lady fair he great
I am a man of strange country
And pray you if it your will be
That I might dwell with you this year
Of your nurture for to lere
I am come out of far land
For I herd tell before hand
Of your nurture and your seruyse
Is holden of so great empryse
I pray you that I may dwell here
Some of your service for to lere
The lady beheld Ipomydan
And seemed well a gentle man
She knew none such in all her land
So goodly a man and well farande
She saw also by his nurture
He was a man of great valor
She cast full soon in her thought
That for no seruyse came he naught
But it was worship her unto
In her seruyse him to do
To ^^yne and Joy for aye
Now Ihesu as thou bought us dear
Give them Joy this gest will here
And harken on a right
Some men loves to here tell
Of doughty knights that were fell
And some of ladies bright
And some miracles that are told
And some of venterous knights old
That for our lord did fight
As Cherles did that noble king
That hethen down did bring
Thrughe the help of god almighty
He wanne fro the hethen hounds
The spear and nails of crystes wounds
And also the croune of thorn
And many a rich relyke mo
Maugre of them he wanne also
And killed them even and morn
The turks and the paynyms bold
He felled down many a fold
Durst none stand him beforne
Charles began them so affraye
That the catyues might curse the day
And the time that they were borne
