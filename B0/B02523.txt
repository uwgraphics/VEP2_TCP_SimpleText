Crumbs of Comfort FOR THE YOUNGEST SISTER
The youngest Sister in despair,
At last did comfort find,
Which banished all her grief and care,
And eased her troubled mind,
A kind young man did promise her
That she should married be,
She answered him again, Kind Sir,
Thereto I Am wondrous free.
To a pleasant new West country Tune.




I Have a good old Father at home,
an ancient man is he,
But he has a mind, that e're he dies,
That I should married be.
And since I heard of thy complaint,
methoughts I pitty'd thee,
To me thou seem like a Saint,
And thou shall married be.
The Roses and the Lillies fair
cannot compare to thee,
Then mine own Dear do not despair,
for thou shall married be
I have been curious in mine eye,
yet never could any see,
That so much pleased my fantasy,
And thou shall married be.
All night between my loving Arms,
thou shall have embraces free,
And i will secure thee from all harms
When thou shall married be.
And would thou have a pretty Babe
i will quickly get it thee,
Thy credit and my own to save,
When we two married be.




A Thousand joys i will promise more
and all the world shall see,
That none like thee I will adore,
And thou shall married be.
What though thy Sister is bestowed,
let not that trouble thee,
On her young men some years have blowd
Thou young shall married be.
Thou have no wrinckles in thy face
and so i am sure has she,
'Twill be an honor, no disgrace,
That thou should married be.
And tell me now can thou deny
so kind a friend as me,
That says thou shall no Maiden die,
But thou shall married be.
If I walk through the Universe
I can no fairee see,
But every where I will rehearse
That we will married be.
I Will Crown thee with the joys of love,
some Mortals never did see,
And some shall wish that live above,
Like us to married be.
Can Hymen any joys provide,
my Dear for thee or me,
Out of his thoughts they cannot slide,
But thou shall married be.
No, no, torment thy self no more,
nor fear loves cruelty,
Thou art the girl that I adore,
And thou shall married be,
Give me thy hand, take here my heart,
and be from sorrow free,
I know the worth of thy desert,
And thou shall married be.
'Twill be one day a blessed time
and we from cares be free,
When thou art married in thy prime
That I may happy be.
