KILLYCHRANKIE
To be sung with its own proper Tune.
CLAVERS and his Highland men,
came down upon the Raw then
Who being stout gave many Clout
The Lads began to claw then,
with Sword and Targets ^n their Hands,
wherewith ^hey were not slow then
And Cl^nk*m Clankim on their Crowns
the Lads began to claw then
2
Over brink and Bank over d^^ch and stank,
her st^k among them a then
The Butter Box g^^ many knocks
their Riggars pey'd for a then*
They got their pakes with sudden strakes,
which to their grief the^ saw then
And double d^uble upon their Rumps
the lads beg^n to (...) then
3
Her Skipt about, and leant about
her ^l^g among them a then,
The English blades got broken Heads,
their Crowns her ^^ave in two then,
The Du^k and Door, made their last hour,
such was their final fa^ then,
They thought the Devil had been there
that gave them such a ^aw then.
4
Jack Presbyter and's Covenant,
came Whigging up the Hill, then,
Thought High land Tr^ws, would not refuse
for to subscribe his Bill then,
In Willies name, he thought na one
would stop the Deed at a, then,
But her n^ne ^el Sh^ck, with many knock,
cried, Wherry Whiggs aw^, then,
5
Sir Hugh M^do^ with his Men true,
came Sk^pping over the Brink, then,
The Hogan (...), that feared such,
they (...) a horrid stink then,
The true Mcleab, his gate ha^ g^ne,
an^ came upon a raw, then
None could withstand his heavy hand
he struck with such a paw then*
6
Oh on o Ri, oh no o Ri,
why should w^ lose King James then,
O rigen die, O rigen die!
her break all hims, Banes, then
^ure n^^^ but st^y a while;
to speak a word or two, then,
And take a struck upon him's neck,
before him gang away, then,
7
Fie for shame him's two for ane,
and yet hers win the day, then,
King James Red Coats should be hanged up
because they fled way, then,
Had bent him's Brows like Highland Trews
and made as long a stay, then,
Her kept her'd King that Sacred thing,
and Willy had gone away, then
8
Now Shentlemen and Caveleers,
come join with her nane sell, then,
For to root out the Dutch Recruit,
and ding them down to Hell then
We'^l meet at ^ne for our King James;
and think it no great pain then
To set him on his Royal Thron
let each man have his ain then
An ANSWER to KILLYCHRANKIE
To be sung with the Tune of Kill^chrankie.
YOU Highland men with Tongue and Pen
what need you so to boast then,
At Killichrankie what you wan,
it was unto your loss then,
My Lord Dundee the best of ye,
into the Fields did f^ then,
And great Pitcurr, fell in a suit
who could not win awa then*
2
And at Du^kel, right fast you fell,
tho you thought well to win then,
But fie for shame I scarce can tell,
how to the Hills you ran then.
O Fur (...) nish, but stay a while,
to speak a word or two then,
With ^^ket Trews, and heavy news,
unto the Hills you draw then,
3
At Crombd^l-hill, you got your fill,
for you we did not spate then,
To best your Bone till over the stones;
you ran with Buttoks bare then,
And many crak behind your back,
sensyne we never saw then,
Your Fools face has little Grace,
can do no good at a then;
4
The Buchan Lairds like unto Cards,
planted on Athole hills then,
Together came, to make a sham;
thinking to get their will then;
At Aberdeen they did come in,
but there they durst not stay then,
Nor make attempt for fear that Hemp:
at length their necks should draw then
5
From Aberdeen in have they hy^*
unto Donoter, came then,
Where Earl of Marchal then did ly,
a Man of worthy fame then,
And General Buchan did def^nd,
his House that they might have there
But he so bravely did demand,
That they proved but like Knaves there,
6
They hois'd up sail, and turned their tail
and straight toward the North then.
And for to join to get some Coin,
fra^ the Earl of Seaforth then
But he was wiser then they thought;
and never thinks to part sua,
With what he got by his good lot,
like Fools from thence their way gae.
7
Thet's Fre^de^^^s Lord, and Oliphant,
and Duglass them all three there;
We have bereaved them of their holds
no more now they can ^o there.
And Davie Graham thinks meikle shame
With the Earl of Dunkel then
And turn-Coat Pet, looks now to bleat
himself he is like to hang then
8
Dumfermling drives his spur-gald Horse
and Buchan whips with wand then,
Cannon like a weary Corss
follows up the Band then,
My lord Seaforth flies frae the North
unto the Court to dwell there
He Is made a swear for many Year,
he never will Rebel mair.
