(...)unto the salvation of the hoell world. For he may pacefye gods wrath
and satisfye his justice (says my lord) by applyinge these merits to them
that lack good works. And so if yt pope will / gods justice may be fullye
satisfied and the hoell world saved. Now if he may so iustlye and easelye
save the hoell world (cherite also movinge him unto it) and yet will not
apply these merits so frutefullye / then is the fault on lie his / and he the
son of perdicyon and wort hye more pain then can be imagined. And so is not
the reason improved but much more stablished / and as I think inevitable.

Behold I pray you whother my lord of Rochestre has brought our holy
father in avauncynge his power so hye / even in to ye depest pit of hell.
Which (if my lord say true) it is impossible for him to avoyde. But it
chances unto him even as it does customablie where such pride reigns: for
when they are at the highest / then fall they down hedlinge unto their utter
confusion and ruin.

If any man feale him silfe greaved and not yet fullye satisfied in this
matter let him write his mind / and by gods grace I shall make him answer
/ and that with speed*

Pray Christen reader yt the word of god may increase. Amen.
Johan Frith unto the Christen Reader.
1. Pet. 1. 2. Tim. 3
BLessed be god the father of our lord Jesus christ / which in these last and
parylous times has sturred up in all contres witnesses un to his son to
testifye the truth un to the unfaithful / to save at the least so me from ye
snares of Antichrist which lead un to perdicyon. 1. Cor. 9.
As ye may here perceyve by that excellent and well learned young man Patrike
borne in scotland of a noble progenye / which to testifye the truth sought all
means and took upon him preesthod (even as Paul circumcysed timothe to win
the weak Jews) that he might be admitted to preach the pure word of god.
Acts. xvi
Notwithstondinge as soon as the chamberlayne and other bisshopes of scotland
had perceyved that the light began to spring which disclosed their falshed
that they convey in darkness / they laid hands on him: and because he would
not deny his savioure christ at their instance they burnte him to ashes.
Nevertheless god of his bounteous merrye (to pubish un to the hole world /
what a man the monsters have murdered / has reserved a little treatise made by
this patrike / which if ye list ye may call Patrikes places. For it
entreats exactelye of certain comen places / which known / ye have the pith
of all divinity. This treatise have I turned in to the english tongue to the
profit of my nacyon: to whom I beseech god give light / that they may espy
the deceytefull paths of perdicyon and return in to the right way which
leads un to life everlastinge. Amen.

Patrikes Places
Of the law.
THe law is a doctrine that bids good and forbids evell as his
commandments specifye. The ten commandments
1 Thou salt worshuppe but one god. 2. Thou shall make y^ none image to
worshuppe i^ 3. Thou shall not swear by his name in vain. 4 Hold the sabbath
day holy. 5 Honor thy father and thy mother. Er. 20. Mat 22.
6 Thou shall not kille 7. Thou shall not commit advoutry. 8 Thou shall not
steal. 9 Thou shall bear no false witness. 10 Thou shall not desire ought
that belongs to thy neighbor


He that loves god and his neighbor keeps all the commandments of god
Love thy lord god with all thine heart / with all thy soul and with all thy
mind. Mayor. Deu. 6 Mat. 22
This is ye first and great commandment: The second is like un to this:
that is / love thy neighbor as thy silfe. In these two commandments hang
all the law and the prophets.

He that loves god / loves his neighbor. Minor. 1. Joa. 4

If a man say / I love god / and yet hates his brother / he is a liar.

He that loves not his brother whom he has seen / how can he love god who^ he
has not seen

He that loves his neighbor as him self keeps all the commandments of
god Conclusion

What so ever ye would that men should do to you / even so do to them. Mat. 7.
For this is the law and the prophets. Romans 13.
He that loves his neighbor / fulfilleth the law. Thou shall not commit
advoutrye. Thou shall not kill Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not bear
false witness.

Thou shall not desire / and so forth if there be any other commandment / are
all comprehended in this sainge: love thy neighbor as thy silfe. Gala. 5
All the law is fulfilled in one word / yt is / love thy neighbor as thy
self.

He yt loves god keeps al ye co^maundme^tes
He that loves his neighbor keeps all ye commandments of god To. xiij.
Gala. v. and he yt loves god loves his neighbor. Mayor
1. Joan. iiij. ergo he yt loves god kepith all his command mentes. Minor.
He that has the faith loves god My father loves you / because ye love me
and beleve that I come of god. Joan. 16


He that has the faith keeps all the commandments of god Conclusio

He that has the faith / loves god / and he that loves god keeps all his
commandments: ergo he that has the faith keeps all the commandments of
god

He that keeps one commandment of god keeps them all.
For with out faith it is impossible to keep any of the commandments of god
/ and he yt has the faith keeps all the commandments of god: Hebre. 11.
ergo he that keeps one commandment of god keeps them all.

He that keeps not all the command mentes of god keeps not one of the^.
He that keeps one commandment of god / he keeps all / ergo he that keeps
not all the co^maun dementes of god keeps not one of them

It is not in our power to keep any of the commandments of god
With out grace / it is impossible to keep any of the commandments of god
/ and grace is not in our power: ergo it is not in our power to keep any of
the commandments of god. eve^ so may you reason concerning the holy ghost
and faith.

The law was given to show us our sin
By the law comes the knowledge of sin I knew not what sin me^t but through
ye law I had not known what lust had me^t / except the law had said thou
shall not lust. Roma. 3. Roma. 7.
with out ye law sin was deed / yt is it moved me not / neither wist I yt it
was sin / which not withsto^dinge was sin and forbobede^ by ye law.

The law bidd^th us do that thing which is impossible for us.
For it bids us keep the commandments of god / and yet is it not in our
power to keep any off the^ / ergo it bids us do that is impossible for us.
Thou will say where to does god bid us do that is impossible for us? I
answer / to make the know that thou art but evil / and that there is no
remedy to save the in thine own hand / and yt thou may seek remedy at
sum other for the law does naught but command the.

Off the gospel.
THe gospel is as much to say in our tongue / as good tidings like as one
of these are Christ is the savioure of the world Joan 4.
Christ is our savior Luce. 2.
Christ dyed for us Roma. 5.
Christ died for our sins Roma. 4.
Christ bought us with his blood 1. Petri. 1.
Christ wyshe us with his blood Apn. 1.
Christ offered him sylfe for us. Heb 2.7.9.
Christ bare our sins on his back. 1. Metri. 2
Esa. 53 Christ came in to this world to save sinners. 1. Timo. 1.
Christ came in to this world to take away our sins 1 Joan. 2.3
Christ was the price that was given for us and our sin 1. Timo. 2
Christ was made debtoure for us. Gene. 3.
Christ has paid our debte / for he died for us These. 5.
Christ has made satisfaccio^ for us and our sin 1. Cor. 1.
Christ is our rightwysenes Christ is our satisfaccyon Christ is our
redemptyon Cyrist is our goodness Christ has pacefyed the father of heaven
Christ is ours and all his Roma. 8.
Christ has delivered us from the law / from the deuell and from hell. The
father of heaven has forgeuen us our sins for christ's sake. Or any such as
declare un to us the mercy of godA


The nature of the law and the gospel.
The law shows us our sin The gospel sh^weth us remedy for it The law
shows us our condempnacyon The gospel shows us our redemption The law
is the word of Ire The gospel is the word of grace The law is the word of
despair The gospel is the word of comfort The law is the word of unrest
The gospel is the word of peace


A dysputacyon between the law and the gosp^ll
The law says / pay thy debt The gospel says Christ has paid it The
law says thou are a sinner / despair and thou shall be damned. The gospel
says / thy sins are forgeuen the be of good comfort thou shall be saved.
The law says / make a mendes for thy sin The gospel says / Christ has
made it for the. The law says / the father of heaven is wrath with the. The
gospel says / Christ has pace fyed him with his blood. The law says
where is thy right wisenesse / goodness and satisfaccyon? The gospel says /
Christ is thy right wysenesse thy goodness and satisfaccyon. The law says
thou art bound and obliged to me / to the devyll and to hell. The gospel
says / Christ has delivered the from them all.


Of faith.
FAith is to believe god: like as Abraham believed god and it was imputed un to
him for rygutwylenesse. Gene. 15.


He that believes god / believes his word. To veleue one is to believe his
word and to recounte it true that he says.

He yt believes not goods word / believes not god him self.
He that believes not gods word he cou^teth him false and a lyare / and
believes not yt he may and will fullfyll his word: 1. Joan. 5.
and so he denies both the might of god and god him self.

Faith is the gift of god*
Every good thing is the gift of god / fayeth is good ergo faith is the
gift of god. Iaco. 1.


Faith is not in our power
The gift of god is not in our power / faith is the girte of god ergo faith
is not in our power

with out faith it is impossible to pleace god
All that comes not of faith is sin / for with out faith ca^ no man pleace
god. To. 14. Heb. 11.
Besides that he that lacks faith / he trusts not god / he that trusts
not god trusts not his word / he that trusts not his word holds hun
false and a liar / he that holds him false and a liar he beleveth not that he
may do that he promises / and so denies he that he is god. And how can a man
being of this facyon pleace him? No manner of way / ye suppose he did al y^
deeds that ever did man or angel.

All that is done in faith pleases God Bight is the word of god and all his
works in faith. Lord thine yien look to faith / yt is as much to say as
lord thou delightest in faith.

God loves him that believes in him / how can they then displeace him He that
has the faith is just and good / and a good tree bears good fruit: ergo all
that is done in faith pleases god.

Morouer / he that has the faith believes god: he that believes god / believes
his word: he yt believes his word / woteth well that he is true and faithful
and may not lie. But knows yt he both may and will fulfill his word / how
can he the^ displease him? for thou can not do any greater honor to god /
the^ to count him true. Thou will then say that theft / murder / advoutrye
and all vices pleace god. Nay verelye for they can not be done in faith: for a
good tree bears good fruit.

He that has the faith wotteth well that he pleases god*
For all that is done in faith pleases god

Faith is a surenesse.
Faith is a sure confidence of things which are hoped for / and a certentye of
things which are not seen. Hebre. 11.


The same sprete certeneth out sprete that we are the children of god More
over he that has the faith wotteth well that god will fulfill his word: Roms.
8.
ergo faith is a surenesse.

A man is justified by faith
Abraham believed god and it was unputed unto him for rightwysenes. Gene. 15.


We supposse ther^ore that a man is justified by faith with out the deeds of
the law He that works not but beleveth on him that iustifyeth the ungodly /
his faith is counted to him for rightwylenesse. Roma. 3.
Roma. 4.


The just man lives by his faith. Abacuc. 2. Gala. 2.
Abacuc. 2. To. 1 We wotre that a man is not justified by the deeds of the
law / but by the faith of Jesus christ. And we believe in Jesus christ / that
we may be justified by the faith of christ and not by the deeds of the law.

Of the faith of christ
The faith of christ / is to believe in him / that is to believe his word and to
beleve that he will help the in all thy need and deliver the from al evil.
thou wylt ask me what word? I answer / the gospel.

He that believes in Christ shall be saved
He that believes the son has everlasting life. Joan. 3. Joan. 6.
verelye / verelye I say un to you / he that be leueth in me has eueriastinge
life.

This I write un to you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye
may know how that ye have eternal life 1. Joan. 5.


Thomas because thou have seen me / therefore have thou believed, Joan. 20.
happy are they yt have not seen / and yet have believed in me.

Al ye prophets to him bear witness / yt who so Acts. 10
ever believes in him shall have remission of their sins. Acts. 16.
What must I do yt I may be saved ye apostles answered believe in ye lord
Jesus christ and thou shall be saved.

If thou knowledge with thy mouth that Jesus is the lord. Roma. 10
And believe with thine heart yt god raised him up from deeth thou shall be sat.

He yt believes not in christ shall be co^de^pned
He that believes not shall be dampened He that believes not the son shall never
se ye life but the ire of god bideth upon him. Marc. 16. Idan. 3.


The ho^ye ghost shall reprove the world of sin / because they believe not in
me

They that believe in Jesus christ are the sons of god.
ye are all the sons of god because ye believe in Jesus christ. Gala. 3.


He yt believes yt christ is ye so^n of god is safe
Peter said / thou art christ ye son of ye lyuinge god. Mat. 16.
Jesus answered and said unto him happy art thou Simo^ ye son of Jonas for
flesh and blood have not opened to the that / but my father that is in heaven.

We have believed and know that thou art Christ the son of the living god.
Joan. 6.


I believe that thou art Christ the son of god which should come in to the
world These things are written yt ye might believe yt Jesus is christ ye son
of god / and yt ye in beleuynge might have life I believe that Jesus is the
son of god. Acts. 8.


He yt believes god. believes the gospel.
He yt believes god believes his word and ye gospel is his word / therefore
he yt believes god believes ye gospel. As / christ is ye savior of ye world.
Christ is out savior. Joan. 4.
Christ bought us with his blood.

Christ wish us with his blood. Apo. 1. Heb. 7.8. 1. Pet. 2.


Christ. offered him self for us.

Christ bare our sins on his own back. etc.

He that believes not the gospel beleveth not god.
He yt beleveth not gods word / beleveth not him self / and the gospel is
gods word / ergo he yt believes not the gospel believes not God him self /
and consequentlye they that believe not the above written and such other / beleve
not god.

He yt beleveth the gospel shall be saffe.
Goo ye in to all the world and preach the gospel unto every creature / he
that beleveth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believes not shall be
condemned Marc. 16


A comparison between faith and unfaith fullness or incredulyte.
Faith is the root of all good Incredulite is the root of all evell Faith
makes god and man good friends Incredulite makes them foes. Faith brings
god and man together Incredulite sundereth them. All yt faith does pleases
god. Faith only makes a man good and rightwise. Incredulite only makes him
in just and evell. Faith makes a man a membre of Christ Incredulite makes him
a membre of the deuell Faith makes a man the enheritoure of heaven.
Incredulite makes him enheritoure of hell Faith makes a man the servant of
god. Incredulite makes him y^ seruau^te of y^ deuell Faith shows us god to
be a sweet father Incredulite shows him a terrible judge. Faith holds
stiff by the words of god Incredulite Wauereth here and there Faith counts
and holds god to be true. Incredulite holds him false and a liar Faith
knows god. Incredulite knows him not Faith loves both god and her
neighbor Incredulite loves neither another Faith only saves us Incredulite
only condempneth us Faith extolleth god and his deades. Incredulite extolleth
her self and her own deeds


Of hope
HOpe is a trustye lokinge after the thing yt is promised us to come: as we
hope after everlasting joy which christ has promised unto all that believe in
him.

We should put our hope and trust in god alonlye and in no another thing
It is good to trust in god and not in man He that trusts in his own heart
is a fool It is good to trust in god and not in princes They shall be like unto
the images they make and all that trust in them He that trusts in his own
thoughts does ungodly Cursed be he that trusts in man. Psalm. 117. Psalm. 113
Bid the rich me^ of this world yt they trust not i^ their unstable riches /
but yt they trust in the lyvinge god. Pro. 11. Hie. 17
It is hard for them that trust in monye to enter in to the kingdom of heaven
Moreover we should trust in him only yt may help us god only may help us
/ ergo we should trust in him only. Mar. 10
well is them that trust in god and woe is them that trust not in him well is the
man that trusts in god for god shall be his trust Hier. 17
He y^ trusts in him shall understand y^ verite They shall all rejoice y^
trust in the / they shall ever be glade and thou will defend them. Sapi. 3.
Psalm. 5


Of cherite.
CHerite is the love of thy neighbor.

The rule of cherite is this.
Do as thou would be done to. For cherite holds all a like the rich and
the poor / the friend and the foo / the thankful and unthankful the
kinseman and stranger.

A compari^on between faith / hope and cherite. Faith comes of ye word of god
/ hope comes of faith / and cherite springs of them both. Faith believes ye
word / hope trusts after it yt is promised by the word / cherite does good
unto her neighbor through the love that it has to god and gladness that is
with in her self.

Faith looks to god and his word / hope looks un to his gift and reward /
cherite looks on her neighbors profitte. Faith receav^th god / hope
receaveth his reward / Cherite loves her neighbor with a glad heart / and
yt with out any respect of reward. Faith pertayneth to god only / hope to
his reward / and cherite to her neighbor.

Of works
NO manner of works make us rightwyse we believe yt a man shall be iustefyed
with out works. Gala. 2.
No man is iustefyed by the deeds of the law / but by the faith of Jesus Christ
/ and we believe in Jesus christ yt we may be iustefyed by the faith of christ
and not by the deeds of ye law. If rightwisenes came by ye law the^ died
christ in vain. Gala. 2. Gala. 3.
That no man is iustefyed by the law it is manifest / for a rightwyse man
lyveth by his faith / but the law is not of faith.

Moreover / since christ the maker of heavyn and earth and all y^ is therein /
behoved to dye for us / we are compelled to grant yt we were so far drouned
and sunke^ in sin yt neither our deeds nor all the treasures yt ever god
made or might make / might have help us out of them / ergo no deeds nor works
may make us rightwyse.

No works make us vnrightwyse.
For if any works made us vnryghtwyse / then the contrary works should make
us rightwyse. But it is proved yt no works can make us rightwyse / ergo no
works make us vnrighwise. works make us neither good nor evel It is proved yt
no works neither make us rightwyse nor vnrightwyse / ergo no works make us
neither good nor evel For rightwyse and good ar one thing and vnrightwyse and
evel likewise one God works make not a good man nor evell works an evell man
/ but a good man makes god works and an evell man evell works.

Good fruit makes not the tree good / nor evell fruit the evell tree / but a
good tree bears good fruit and an evell tree evell fruit. Mat. 7.
A good man can not do evell works nor an evel man good works / for a good
tree ca^ not bear evell fruit nor an evell tree good fruit. A man is good ere he
do good works / and evell ere he do evel works / for the tree is good ere it
bear good fruit and evel ere it bear evel fruit Every man is either good or
evel. Everye tree is either good or evel / either make ye the tree good and ye
fruit good also / or else make the tree evel and the fruit of it likewise evel.
Mat. 12
Every man's works are either good or evell For all fruit trees are either
good or evel. Mat. 12
Either make ye ye tree good and the fruit god also / or else make ye tree evel
and the fruit of it likewise evel A good man is known by his works for a good
man does good works and an evil evell works ye shall know the^ by their
fruit / for a good tree bears good fruit / and an evell tree evell fruit A man
is likened to the tree and his works to the fruit of the tree Beware of ye false
prophets which come to you in shepes clothinge / but inwardly they are
raueninge wolves. Mat. 7.
ye shall know the^ by their fruits

None of our works neither save us nor condemn us.
It is proved yt no works make us neither rightwyse nor vnrightwyse / good nor
evell / but first we are good ere we do good works and evell ere we do evell
works / ergo no works neither save us nor co^de^pne us. Thou will say / the^
makes it no matter what we do. I answer / yes. For if thou do evell / it is a
sure argument yt thou art evell / and want y^ faith. If thou do good it is
an argument yt thou art good and have y^ faith / for a good tree bears good
fruit and an evell tree evell fruit / yet good fruit makes not ye tree good /
nor evell fruit ye tree evell / so ye man is good ere he do good deeds ad evell
ere he do evell deeds. The man is y^ three / his works are ye fruit. Faith
makes ye good tree and incredulite ye evel tree such a tree such fruit such a man
such works. For all yt is done in faith pleases god and are good works. And
all y^ is done with out faith displeases god and are evell works.

Who so ever believes or thinks to be saved his works denies yt christ is
his savior / yt christ dyed for him and all thing yt pertayneth to christ.
For how is he thy savior / it thou might save thy self by thy works? or
whereto should he dye for y^ if any works might have saved y^? what is this to
say / christ dyed for y^? verelye yt is / thou should have died perpetuallye
/ and christ to delyver y^ fro yt deeth / died for y^ and changed thy
perpetual deeth in to his own deeth. For thou made y^ fault / and he
suffered ye pain / and yt for y^ love he had to the ere ever thou wast borne
when thou had done neither good nor evell. Now since he has paid thy debt
thou nedest not: no thou can not / but should be dapned if his blonde were
not. But since he was punished for the thou shall not be punished. Finallye / he
has delyvered ye from thy conde^pnacio^ and all evell / and desires naught of
the but yt thou will aknowlege what he has done for y^ and bear it in mind /
and yt thou would help other for his sake both in word and deed / eve^ as
he has helped y^ for naught and with out reward / O how ready would we be to
help other / if we knew his goodness and gentleness toward us. He is a
good and a gentle lord for he does all for naught. Let us I beseech you follow
his fotesteppes whom all the world ought to praise and worshuppe / Amen

He that thinks to be saved by his works calls him self Christ
For he calls him self his savioure which partayneth to christ only. What
is a savior but he yt saves / and he says I save my self / which is as
much to say as I am christ for christ only is the savioure of the world we
should do no good works for y^ intent to get the enheritaunce of heaven or
remission of sin For who so ever beleveth to get y^ enheritaunce of heaven
or remission of sin through works / he believes not to get yt for christ's
sake. And they yt believe not yt their sins are forgiven the^ and yt they
shall be saved for christ's sake / they believe not y^ gospel. For the gospel
says / you shall be saved for christ's sake / your sins are forgiven for
christ's sake. He yt beleveth not y^ gospel heleueth not god. So it follows yt
they which beleve to be saved by their works / or to get remission of their
sins by their own deeds believe not god: but recounte him as a liar and so
utterly deny him to be god. Thou will say / shall we the^ do no good deeds? I
say not so but I say we should do no good works for ye intent to get ye
enheritaunce of heaven or remission of sin* For if we believe to get ye
enheritau^ce of heaven through good works / the^ we believe not to get it
through ye promise of god: or if we think to get remission of our sin the
we believe not yt they are forgiven us / and so we count god a liar. For god
says / thou sha^t have ye enheritaunce of heaven for my sons sake / thy
sins are forgiven yt for misonnes sake and you say it is not so / but I will
win it through my works. So I co^de^pne not good redis / But I code^pne ye
false trust in any works / for all ye works yt a ma puts co^fide^ce in are
therewith poisoned and become evel. Therefore do ye good works but beware you do
the^ not to get any good through yt / for if thou do / thou receyvest the good
not as the gift of god but as debt to the and make thy self fellow with
god because thou will take nothing of him for naught. what neadeth he any
thing of thine which geveth al thing and is not y^ poorer? Therefore do
nothing to him but take of him / for he is a getle lord / and with a gladder
will gives us all yt we need / then we take it of him / therefore if we want
ought let us wit our selves. Preasse not then to ye enheritaunce of heaven
through presumpcio^ of thy good works for if thou do / thou countest thy silfe
holy and egall to him because thou will take nothing of him for naught: and
so shall thou fall as Lucifer fell for his pride.

Finis.
