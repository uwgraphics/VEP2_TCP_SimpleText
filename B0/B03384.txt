The Frowns of FATE, OR, An ANSWER To the Young-Mans Unfortunate Destiny.
When Maids so Coy will slight their Joy,
With scorn, and high Disdain,
Then grief and care with sad Despair,
Will end their Days in pain.
To the Tune of, The Doubting Virgin.


WHen she heared how he died,
in a sad and woeful state.
Bitterly aloud she cried,
and in sorrow did relate;
Was I cruel to my jew^l,
that in Love did me adore,
Well she cried, and replied,
I shall never see thee more.
O that I had never denied,
what he did propose to me,
But had willingly complied,
^
Love unfeigned, never stained,
but as constant as the day.
Death possess me, Heavens Bless me,
I have cast thy life away.
He most courteously did woo me,
it is I that am too blame,
He did proffer to endue me,
with a plenty to maintain
Me in Splendour, this does render,
all my actions now to be,
To refuse him, and abuse him,
^




Oftentime he has entreated,
that he might salute my hand,
Yea, and many times repeated
he would be at my command
So entire, his desire
was to love without deceit,
When he smiled, I reviled,
and did scornfully retreat.
Now too late I do repent it,
I have cast his life away,
Had I but in love consented,
he had never seen the day:
When we parted, broken hearted,
he with sorrow was oppressed:
And bewailed, as he Sailed,
over Neptunes Curled breast.
I in sorrow am surrounded,
that I know not where to go,
My poor heart with grief is wounded,
I am in a Sea of woe;
No remission, my condition
is to languish to my grave,
To appease me, Death come seize me,
this is that I fain would have.
Cupid now does over rule me,
with his sharp severity,
He does so chastise and School me,
For his power; he I devour
all the comfort of my life,
Never ceasing, but increasing,
death must surely end the strife.
^
Love, the thought of thee is killing,
I am haunted now with fears,
Heart and life with grief is filling,
and a thousand melting tears
Now is flowing, life is going
hence, into Eternity,
Then she cried, and replied,
love, I Will dye, and come to thee.
Then her reason quite forsook her,
falling into deep despair,
In her hand a Knife she took her,
which did soon her life impair;
She lay bleeding, so exceeding,
bidding now the World adieu;
Death that hour, came in power,
and in full Commission too.
You that hear this mournful Ditty,
of true Lovers Tragedy,
Let your heart be moved to pity,
learn to love with Loyalty;
Then you will flourish, when you nourish
he that does you highly prize,
Never conceal it, but reveal it,
