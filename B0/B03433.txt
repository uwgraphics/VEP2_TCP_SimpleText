A Farther ACCOUNT OF THE Siege of Lymerick: WITH A RELATION OF THE Taking of
Castle- Connel, Carrick-Gunnel, and the Island of Buffin.
AS ALSO, Of Coll. Wooseley's pursuing of Sarsesield, etc.
LICENSED, September the 10th.

(...) the Camp before Lymerick, September. the 2 d. 1691.
WE having beat the Enemy from Ireton's Fort, as likewise from the Old Chapel,
with the Ad^^^ Fort, together with several other (...) Forts, and Outworks,
made by (...) French Ingineers last Winter, (ac^^^^^ng as you have already
heard.)

On the 26 th. ult. at Night, we broke Ground; our Approaches Advancing very
successfully, with very little loss.

On the 27th. by Break of Day, the Prince of Hess-Darmstadt, Colonel Tiffin,
and Colonel St. John's Regiments, with about seven hundred Horse and Dragoons,
with five Pieces of Canon, Marched to take in Castle-Connel; where the Enemy
have a great Garrison; and another Party, with Four Guns, Marched to take in
Three other Castles, wherein the Enemy have Garrisons down the River.

Very early this Morning, the Enemy fired from two Guns they had drawn down
below the Town, on our left; which Obliged us to Draw a little further off,
till we could better secure our Men.

This Morning, Orders were given for Arming One Thousand Grenades, and Six
Hundred Bombs; which were many of them, ready to Play by Eight of the Clock at
Night.

This Day, Carrick Gunnel Castle, whose. Garrison was 130 Men, and Two
Captains, Commanded by one Archbold, Surrendered upon Mercy; and the Prisoners
were immediately put into the Provoe's Custody.

This Day, likewise, our Fleet, being Eighteen Sail Complete, came up the
Shannon, toward Lymerick, under the Command of Captain Coal They fired so
briskly, as they passed by the Enemies small Camp in Cother^ough, that they
made most of them scamper to the Adjacent Hills. Our Ships came to an Anchor,
two Miles below the Town, where they will be assistant in Battering the Place.

The 28th. This Morning the General went on Board the Fleet, which he within
less than three Miles of the Town; and after having had a short Conference with
Captain Coal, he returned again on Shar, to the Camp.

The 29th. We had an Account this Day, That the Island of Buffin baving
Capitulated to surrender, Captain Dunbar who is ordered to be Governor of that
Issand, was Sailed thither, with a Detatchment of Sir Henry Bellassis Regiment,
to Garrison it: Likewise, That the Earl of Granand with one Thousand of the
Militia of Dublin, being joined with many Regiments of the County-Militia, and
some Regular Troops, had passed the Shannon at Athlone, in their way to Slego,
in order to reduce that Place: This Afternoon we began to Play with our Mortars,

The 30th. This Day we began to play from our several Batteries we raised from
the Forts we took from the Enemy.

We hear, That O Donnel, with his Servants, are gone to Galway, in order to
surrender; but his Party endeavor to make a Head of themselves.

The 31th. Great Numbers of Deserters come daily into our Camp; who giv^ an
Account, that our Two Batteries, raised on the Left of the Town, have done
considerable Execution, by setting Fire to the Town in three several Pla^^

Sept. 1. This Day, two Captaint, th^^^ Lieutenants, and two Ensigns came o^^^
to us. The Enemy have been very ^^^ring as well of their Shot, as their
S^llies; which makes us believe, (and, (...) the late Deserters report,) that
they are in much want of Ammunition.

The Castle of Connel surrendered to the Prince of Hess-Dermstadt; the Garris^^
consisting of Four hundred Men, (...) sent Prisoners to Clonmel, under (...)
Guard.

Sept. 2. Col. Wolseley, with a (...) Party of Five hundred Horse, and some
Troops of Dragoons, etc. is gone from the Camp to Killaloo; where we have (...)
Account, Sarsfield is roving with his Parties.

Our Guns from the several (...) continued to Play last Night, and all (...)
Day incessantly; and, as we hear by D^serters just now come into our Camp with
very great Success; one of the^ being chiefly against Thom^^ (...) which we
hope speedily to batter down by which means, we shall cut off (...)
Communication between the Iris^ (...) English Town of Lymerick.

We hear, That a Party of our M^^ are ordered to Attack King's ^^^^d, a^^ the
Castle thereunto belonging.

We hear likewise, That the Garris^^ in Lymerick, are buoyed up with (...)
Pretense of a Prophecy they have, (...) the English Army in this War, should
^^duce all Ireland, but Lymerick; and th^^ then they should not only preserve
(...) said place, but retake all again.

We doubt not, but in Three or F^^^ Days, we shall be able to make a Bre^^^ in
the VValls, by our Batteries, that Men may enter.
