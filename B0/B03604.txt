A godly new Ballad, Entitled, A dozen of Points.
A dozen of Points you may here read,
Whereon each Christians soul may feed.




THe gift is small, a dozen of points,
Wherewith I Would wish you knit your joints,
Keep well the same and credit me.
Thy life most pure and just shall be.
The first Point's this I wish you keep,
Is that at night before you sleep:
Still see you ask God forgiveness
Of all your sins and wickedness.
The second Point is this I say,
When thou do see the cheerful day,
Arise and praise the God of might
That has defended thee all night.
The third is this that thou would require,
And on thy bended knees desire,
The God of heaven to be thy stay,
For to preserve thee night and day.
The fourth does bid thee to beware,
And to avoid the subtle snare,
For Satan with his crafty power
Does seek men's souls for to devour.
The fifth good counsel does thee give,
And warn thee well whilst thou do live,
To keep thy conscience clear and pure
Then God will bless thee to be sure.
The sixth of these my Points do will
That thou devise no subtle skill,
Whereby to work thy Neighbors woe,
Take heed I say and do not so.
The seventh says, defraud no man,
But deal as justly as you can;
The Widow and the Fatherless defend
So God will bless thee to the end.
The eighth does bid thee more or less
Still to beware of drunkenness;
For drunkenness is abhorred of God
On whom he lays his heavy rod.
The ninth says, Fornication fly,
Those wicked Harlots will make thee die:
Thy body they will consume I say,
And bring thy soul unto decay.
The tenth does say, do not forswear,
False witness against no man bear:
Let no affection sway thy mind
The eye of Justice for to blind.
The eleventh enjoins thee not to desire
Thy Neighbors goods for to require,
But the ten Commandments observe,
So shall thou stand and never swerve.
The twelfth says, fear the God of might,
And truly serve him day and night:
Obey the King as it is thy part
To thy Country bear a faithful heart.
See these my Points thou do possess,
Even when thou thy self do rest:
Keep well each one in his degree,
And knit them fast and credit m^
The Angel Gabriell, his Salutation to the Blessed Virgin MARY.
To the tune of, The Blazing Torch.
depiction of the Virgin Mary and Christ child

WHen righteous Joseph wedded was
to Isreal's Hebrew maid,
A glorious Angel came from Heaven,
who to the Virgin said:
Hail blessed Mary full of grace,
the Lord remains in thee:
Thou shall conceive and bear a Son
thy Savior to be.
That Is wondrous strange quoth Mary then
I should conceive and breed,
Being never touched by mortal man,
but pure in thought and deed.
Fear not, quoth Gabriel by and by,
it is no work of man:
But only God's, ordained at first
before the world began.
Which heavenly message she believes,
and did to Jury go,
Three months with her friends to stay,
Gods blessed will to show:
And then returned with Joseph back,
her Husband meek and mild,
Who thought it strange his wife should be
untoucht, thus grown with child.
Wherefore (thought he) to shun that shame
he thought her to forsake:
But that Gods Angel in his sleep
Gods mind did undertake.
Fear not just Joseph this thy wife
is still a spotless Maid,
And no consent to sin (quoth he)
against her can be laid.
For she is purely Maid and Wife,
the mother of Gods own Heir,
The Babe of Heaven, and blessed Lamb,
of Isreal's stock so fair:
To save lost sheep to Satan sold,
whom Adam lost by fraud,
When first in Edens Paradise
the Lord had them bestowed.
Thus Mary with her Husband kind,
together did remain,
Until the time of Jesus birth
as Scripture does make plain.
Thus Mother, Wife, and Virgin pure,
our Savior sweet conceived,
All three in one to bring us joy,
of which we were bereaved.
Sing praises then both old and young,
to him which wrought such things,
That thus without the help of man
sent us the King of Kings:
Which is of such a blessed power,
that with his word can quell
The World, the Flesh, and by his Death
could conquer death and hell.
