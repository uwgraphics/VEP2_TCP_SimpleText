The CASE of the Poor Workmen Glass-Makers: Humbly Offered to the Honorable
House of Commons, against Passing the Bill for Laying Duties on GLASS,etc.
I. THAT there is so great an Improvement of the Art, or Mystery of Making
Glass, within this Our Kingdom, as that there are now great Quantities
frequently Exported, to the Absolute Prevention of all Importations thereof, as
formerly.

II. That, by Means of the said Improvement, there has been a great Increase
of Artificers, and Poor Workmen, who (by Reason of the Wars, and the
Obstruction thereby made, in the Exportation, and Vent of Glass) have several
Times, for near Half a Year together, been Destitute of all manner of
Employment; whereby many of them are Reduced to such an Exigency, as that they
cannot support Themselves, and Families.

III. That should a Bill pass, for Laying the said Duties on Glass, the
Greatest Part of the said Artificers, and Workmen, will be Constrained to
leave this their Native Country, to the utter Decay of the Art of Glass-Making
Here, and to the Encouragement of Foreign Places, where they shall Inhabit.

It is therefore Humbly hoped, That this Honorable House will not Discourage
these Artificers, and their Manufactury; It being obvious almost to every Man,
how Inconsiderable a Sum will be Raised, by Laying a Duty on Glass, for His
Majesty's Service.
