A Declaration of the Lord General, the general Officers, and the rest of the
Officers and Soldiers of the Scottish Army.
New Castle 27. June 1646.
THe manifold Calamities and heavy Pressures, the sad Afflictions lying upon
these Kingdoms this time past, and the great Effusion of Christian Blood,
occasioned by the continuance of this unnatural War, having so deeply
wounded us; And being earnestly desirous to give some evident Testimony of our
Piety to God, Loyalty to our Sovereign, and Love to his Kingdoms; That the
constancy of our Affection to this Cause, our Zeal to the Reformation of
Religion, and his Majesty's Person and Authority in defense thereof, and our
firm Resolutions to pursue the Ends expressed in our Solemn League and
Covenant may appear to the World; We have thought it necessary in this juncture
of Time (when all means are essayed by the Enemies of Truth and Peace to
disparage our Proceedings, by rendering suspected our best Actions and
Endeavors, to the begetting of misunderstanding, and weakening the Union
betwixt the two Kingdoms) to Declare and make known, that as we entered in a
Solemn League and Covenant with our hands lifted up to the most high God, with
real Intentions to promote the Ends thereof: so do we resolve (God willing)
constantly to adhere to the whole heads and Articles of the same; and and for
no Earthly Temptation, for no fear nor hope, to fall away and violate our
sacred Oath.

We do likewise profess that nothing has been with greater care and
faithfulness endeavored by us, then to preserve the happy Union and Brotherly
Correspondence between the two Kingdoms, as a principal mean of happiness to
both, and shall continue the same care to avoid every thing that may tend to
the infringement, with a special regard and tenderness to the interests of
both Kingdoms: for the strengthening of which Union and removing every thing
which might obstruct the same; as hitherto we have had no compliance, nor keep
Correspondence with known Enemies and Malignants; so will we never hereafter
give countenance or encouragement to any Person disaffected to the Parliament
of either Kingdoms.

And that the integrity of our Intentions, and uprightness of our desires may
be the more manifest, we do declare that we do abhor all Public and Private
ways contrary to the Covenant, and destructive to the happiness of both
Kingdoms; We disclame all dealing with those that are Instruments of these
unhappy troubles and impediments of Peace, and with all such Persons who will
not use all means and Endeavors and contribute their best Counsels and advice
for hastening an end to our lasting Miseries, and procuring a sure and well
grounded Peace: And in particular we do abominate and detest that execrable
Rebellion of James Grahame, utterly abjuring all manner of Conjunction with him
and his confederates, and with all other known Enemies or declared Traitors to
either Kingdoms, notwithstanding any insinuations to the contrary expressed in
some Letters, as is said to be sent by his Majesty to the Earl of Ormond in
Ireland, for we have none but single intentions and unfaigned desires of Peace,
renouncing all communion with whatsoever Designs and Practices contrived in
the dark, to the prejudice of Religion, and Tranquillity of these Kingdoms, the
only principles by which we move.

And as we came into this Kingdom at the earnest desire of our Brethren, to
assist them in the time of their great extremity, in the pursuance of the
National Covenant, not for any mercenary Ends, nor to enrich our selves; as is
falsely and calumniously charged upon us, by those that wish not well to us nor
our Cause, so shall we be most willing to depart and return home in peace with
the same cheerfulness and affection that we had when we came in; Nor shall the
matter of money, or want of just Recompense for the service performed and
hardship sustained, be to us an Argument of our stay, but leaving the
consideration of these things to the wisdom and descretion of both Parliaments,
we shall so far deny our selves, as not to suffer any private respects of our
own, to retard the Advancement of the work, or prejudice the Public good of
both Kingdoms.

We cannot conceal, but must acknowledge how sensible we are, and have always
been of the many complaints presented to the Parliament of England against this
Army, and the heavy calumnies and aspersions lying upon us, for having
committed Insolences, and oppressed the people by taking of free Quarters,
offering our selves most willing and ready, that whosoever amongst us have by
their Misdemeanors, Miscarriages, or Inordinate way of walking, Scandalized
the Cause (for which we have taken our lives in our hands) or endeavored to
beget a Misunderstanding, or foment Jealousies betwixt the Kingdoms; we shall
strive to discover all such, and labor to bring them to public Trial, and
condign punishment: Not doubting, but as we are zealous to vindicate our
honor and reputation from Reproaches, so the Parliament will likewise be
pleased to have such favorable Construction of our proceedings, as not
willingly to harbor any thoughts which may lessen their respects to us, and
which are not suitable to the constant Tenor of our Carriage and Profession:
And we shall likewise desire, that the manifold necessities and pressing wants
to which we were many times reduced, may not be forgotten, and that the ways
and means appointed for our supply, neither answered the expectation of the
honorable Houses of Parliament, nor satisfied our necessities; so that for
want of Moneys we could not always discharge our Quarters: Yet do we most
freely declare our willingness to allow off whatsoever has been taken up by
us: And for that effect we desire the Accounts of the Army to be adjusted, with
the several and respective Counties, that what ever can be justly charged upon
us, may be discompted off any sums that shall be resting us in Arrear: And if
we knew any thing else that could serve to remove all Jealousies and
Misunderstandings, and beget a more full confidence of our uprightness, we
should with the same readiness apply our selves to all the ways that might
conduce thereto.

But because his Majesty's sudden and unexpected coming into this Army, does
minister new occasion to us, to give some Demonstration of our Constancy
(though we hope his Majesty came with real intentions to satisfy the just
desire of his Parliaments, and compose these unhappy defferences) yet lest it
should bring in question the clearness and Integrity of our ways, whereof our
Conscience bears us witness, and our Actions shall be public and real
Testimonies; we do profess that his presence with us has not begot any
alteration in our minds in the least measure, to estrange us from the ways of
our Covenant, or alienate our Resolutions from going on zealously, constantly,
and unanimously, to set forward the ends therein expressed, endeavoring (so far
as lies in our power) to improve that Providence of his coming to us, to the
public good and happiness of both Kingdoms. And as it is our earnest desire
that his Majesty would no more suffer himself to be involved in the councels,
whereof he has now so sad experience, to the indangering of his Person,
Posterity, and Kingoms; so do we exceedingly wish that he would comply with the
Counsels of his Parliaments, to the satisfaction of his good people; and shall
be careful that nothing proceed from us which may give occasion to his
Majesty to entertain any secret confidence that this Army will give
Assistance for advancing other Ends then such as are agreeable to our Covenant,
Conducing to the good of Religion, the happiness of the King and his
Posterity, and safety of the Kingdoms.

A Petition presented by the Lord General, general Officers, and other
Officers in the Scottish Army.
May it please your Majesty,
WE your Majestes loyal Subjects and faithful Servants, The Lord General,
The general Officers, The Colonells and Captains in the Scottish Army, now in
the Kingdom of England, from the deep sense of the bleeding condition of these
Kingdoms, so pressed with sad affliction, through the unhappy differences between
your Majesty and your Subjects, from the true Affection and Zeal to the
Reformation of Religion, and your Majesty's Person and Authority in defense
thereof, and in pursuance of that sacred Oath which we have taken, with our
hands listed up to the most high God; Do make our humble address, and tender
this earnest Petition to your Majesty in our own name, and in the name of all
the inferior Commanders and Souldi^rs under onr Charge, That your Majesty in
your Wisdom and Goodness may be pleased to take speedy course for settling
Religion and Church Government in this Kingdom, according to the word of God,
and example of the best reformed Churehes, and bring the Churches in the three
Kingdoms to the nearest Conjunction and Uniformity, and for establishing the
Privileges and Liberties of your Kingdoms, according to the desires of your
good people. We may not conceal our unfeigned Grief, for that your Majesty
has not yet been pleased to Authorize and Sign the Covenant, which we are
confident would bring Honor to God, Happiness to your Self and Posterity,
and indeare your Majesty (above measure) to all your faithful and loyal
Subjects: In the just defense whereof, as many of them have already lost their
lives, so are we ready to sacrifice ours. We must also pray your Majesty to
compassionate the distressed conditions of your Kingdoms, groaning under the
heavy pressures of manifold Calamities, occasioned by the continuance of this
unnatural War, and to comply with the Counsels of your Parliaments, that all
differences being happily composed, and the Armies in both Kingdoms disbanded,
We may return home in Peace, or be disposed of otherwise by your Majesty,
with the advice of your Parliament, which may be most for your Majesty's Honor
and Service, and the prosperity of these Kingdoms.

By his Majesty's Command.
I Am in his Name to return this Answer to the Petition presented to him by the
Lord General, The general Officers, The Colonels and other Officers and
Soldiers of the Scots Army; That his Majesty came to the Scots Army with
full intention of settling an happy Peace in those his Kingdoms, and to
satisfy the just desires of his good Subjects: And likewise to comply with his
Parliaments, in all things which shall be for the good of Religion, and the
happiness of his Subjects, which he will always prefer to all worldly
interests. And whenever it shall please God so to bless his Majesty's
endeavors as to settle an happy Peace in these his three Dominions, his
Majesty will be very solicitous to find out some means of honorable
employment for so many gallant men as are employed in this Army.

At New castle the 27 of June 1646. Sic subscribiter Lanerik
