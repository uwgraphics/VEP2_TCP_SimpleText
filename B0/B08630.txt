The CASE concerning the Election of Burgesses of PARLIAMENT for EYE in SUFFOLK.
AT the Election, the Persons that stood in Competition, were Sir Charles Gaudy
Knt. and Bart. Sir Robert Reve Bart. Charles Fox Esquire; and George Walsh Esquire;

Sir Charles Gaudy, and Sir Robert Reve had the Majority of Votes; And
thereupon by both the Bailiffs were Proclaimed Duly Elected, without any
Contradiction.

Yet the Junior Bailiff afterward refused to join with the Senior Bailiff; who
thereupon, alone, returned Sir Charles Gaudy, and Sir Robert Reve; And the
Junior Bailiff unduly Returned Mr. Fox, and Mr. Walsh.

The Right of this Election is to be heard the First Cause before the Committee
of Elections and Privileges on Monday the 29th. day of this instant November,
1680.
