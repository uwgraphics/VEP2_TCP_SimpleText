A vvonderfull vvonder,
Being a most strange and true relation of the resolute life, and miserable
death of Thomas Miles, who did forswear himself, and wished that God might
show some heavy example upon him, and so it came to pass for as he sat at
his Meat he choked himself, and died in short space after, which happened the
8. of August last, 1635. and being ripped up by the Chirurgions of S.
Bartholomewes Hospital, was found to have a gub of meat sticking fast in his
throat, which was the cause of his death. Written to warn all rash Swearers
to forsake their evil ways, which God grant we may.

To the tune of, Aim not too high, etc.




Look down O Lord upon this sinful Land,
Guide, and defend us with thy mighty hand,
Against the fiery Darts of Satan's power,
Which seeks our Souls and Bodies to devour.
This World is full of envy and debate,
Neighbor to neighbor bears a deadly hate:
Brother against Sister, friend against each friend,
Which shows the World is very near an end.
Vile blasphemy is used against the Lord,
By old and young at every trifling word:
Some in their angry mood will Curse and Swear,
As if they would their God in pieces tear.
But let them know that do the Lord provoke
By cursed oaths, on them to strike the stroke:
Know that all though he suffers them a space,
He will at last confound their wicked race.
As for example* here I mean to tell
A strange relation which of late befell,
Of one a forsworn wretch as is well known,
On whom the Lord a wonder great has shown.
This wretched man of whom these lines are pend,
Denied a truth, a bad cause to defend:
And rashly wished in place whereas he stood,
That he might never eat meat to do him good.
Now mark Gods Judgments how they strangly fell,
A short time after, grief it is to tell:
He with some others more to Dinner went,
To give their hungry stomachs some content.
But as they sat at Table with their meat,
Having made bargain for it they fell to eat:
This forsworn wretch Tom Miles called by name,
Fed very greedily upon the same.
And thrusting in a bit that would not pass
Quite down his throat, his lucklesse hap it was
To choke himself, the very truth was so,
While all the rest behel'd him with great woe.
Unto a Surgent then he ran with speed,
Desiring him to help him in his need:
But all in vain, no help for him could be.
His breath was stopped, and he died presently.
The second part,
To the same tune.


ANd being dead the Surgeons took in hand,
To rip him up, that they might understand
The truth and reason how he lost his breath,
And how he came by his untimely death.
Which having done they found with woe at last,
The gub of meat stick in his throat so fast,
Which was the cause of this his lives decay,
Because it could not thence be put away.
Within the Hospital his corpse does lie,
Men of good credit can it testify,
His body buried was without control,
But God grant mercy to his soul.
Let this example warn us to amend,
That we by oaths may not our God offend:
O let each Man and Woman now refrain
From taking of Gods holy name in vain.
He that delights in Oaths and Curses vild,
And has therewith his spotted Soul defild:
May now bewail the time that he was borne,
Sin is the cause that makes a Land to mourn.
Hie time it is for us to watch and pray
Upon our bended knees both night and day,
Unto our God, that he will mercy take
On us poor souls for Jesus Christ his sake.
For surely this we well may understand
The Lord is angry with this sinful Land:
His judgments has so many ways bin shown
Throughout our coasts as is to many known.
What visions in the Air, and fearful sights
Have bin of late which wonder may affrights,
Thunder, and Lightnings, to procure our fears,
Enough to make each flintie heart shed tears.
All those are signs to warn us to repent,
Which God as messengers has to us sent
For to reclaim us from our former sin,
Which we so long have slept and wallowed in.
But to conclude, sweet Jesus give us grace,
That we on earth may run a godly race:
That when by death our life is taken away,
We may through thee eternal life enjoy.
