The LASSES of KINGHORN
Tune of Clavers and his Highland Men.
ALl Gentlemen and Cavaliers
that does delight in sport,
Come here and listen to my Song,
for it shall be but short:
And I Will tell you as brave a Jest,
as ever you did hear:
The Lasses of Kinghorn Town
put our Officers in fear.
2
It fell upon a Wednesday
the Month of February,
Some of the brave Commanders
came to Kinghorn Ferry.
Having (...) them a Chapman Lad,
a ^^^^^er they had Taken,
The Tide was spent e're they came there,
and to the Town the'r^ g^re
3.
And as they went along the street
the Chapman made his Moan.
He wrang his hands and said, alas,
that ever he was born;
For I Am a silly poor Peddler,
from me they taken my Pack,
Of all my seven years gathering
they left me not a plack.
4.
But yet with this they are not content.
nor will they pass me so,
But I must be a Soger,
to Flanders I must go.
To Flanders I must go?
a Soger for to be.
But I will die e're I come there,
I Will be so sick at sea.
5.
The Women were much moved
to hear him make his Moan.
And some of them most courteously
unto the Captain's gone,
Desiring him of Charity
tha^ he would let him gang
^^^^e answered them disdainfully,
he would rather see him hang.
6.
The women were much moved,
and took this as a slight,
Said be should be relieved
in spite of all the^r Might:
They gathered right h^st^ly,
and forth into a row,
With Bleechins K^ocks and Harrow Bills
I ^ot they were not slow.
7.
The Captains they went back again,
and out their Swords did draw,
The women then they l^ugh at them,
of that they stood not awe;
But thou on them they thronged so fast
unto the ground them dang,
And took the Swords cut of their hands,
and soundly did them bang.
8
The Captains they got up again,
and longer durst not bide,
For little of their Valor
I Am sure was seen that tide:
The women they charged furiously,
till that they made them ^un
With ^leeching Knocks and Harrow Bills
but neither Sword nor Gun.
9
The Women they charged furiously.
ran down the Brae like fire,
They made the Captains stand in awe.
and yield to their desire:
The first was Captain Wilson,
with a Rung in her hand,
She made the Captain stand in awe,
and yield to her Command.
10.
The next was Major Stenson
and her sister also,
Give me the Pedler's Pack again
e're that ye further go
She took the Serjant by the breast,
she threw him on his back?
Lieutenant Bi^^el hastily
took up the Chapmans Pack.
11.
But out came Colonel Turnbul,
that honest Widow Wife,
She asked at her Comerades.
what meaned all this strife?
They Have taken a silly poor Peddler,
and will not let him go:
She answered them courageously
faith it shall not be so.
12.
She took a Knock into her hand
of Bleeching she is good,
She caused the Serjant stagger
in the place where he stood.
And in her hand in his Pocket
and out the Purse did draw,
Gave him a cli^k out over the Crown.
awa ye Rogue awa
13
The Sailers they leugh heartily
for to behold the sport,
To see the Captains run away
for shelter to the Boat:
But up spoke General Paterson.
she spoke with Counsel good,
And she desired to sound retreat.
for she would have no Blood.
14
For we have got the Pedlers Pack and Purse
and this is all had he,
Had it not been for King William's sake,
we'd drowned them in the Sea.
The Captains then they were right glad,
when that this News they heard,
Desired the Seamen hoise their Sails
and not longer to bide.
15.
For we have all been Sogers
more then this duzen of years.
And all the Battles we were at,
we were never in such Fears,
O fie on you for Sogers
that ever you took pay,
The Lasses of Kinghorn Town
they made you run away.
FINIS.
