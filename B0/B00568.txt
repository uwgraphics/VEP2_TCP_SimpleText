The Praise of a pretty Less: OR, The Young man's dissimulation:
Else he would not disgrace
A Maiden in such fashion,

To the tune of, Bank's Game.




YOung men and Maidens, to you I Will declare,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
Yet took Goddess will I her compare,
And yet she is pretty indifferent fair;
With o my Love o, there is none does know
how I do love thee.
She is not black, nor yet is she brown,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
But to her Portion, she has thirty pound,
Besides all this, she has an old black Gown:
O my love o, there is none etc.
She is not great, nor yet very small,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
She Is a yard and a half in the waste, that is all,
Her flesh will preserve her hard bones from a fall:
O my Love o, etc.
Her Hair is as black as is any Crow,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
Her good conditions there is no man does know,
For she never came where as any did grow:
O my Love o, etc.
She has a Nose in the middst of her face,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
And that stands bravely unto her own grace,
I dare say a better never stood in that place:
O my Love o, there is none does know
how I do love thee.
Her Cheeks are fat, and fair for to see,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
They with her Eyes wondrous well do agree,
She is a brave bonny Less lovely and free:
O my Love o, there is none does know
how I do love thee.
She has soft Lips, and sound ones they are,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
You may kiss your fill, and need not to spare,
For there is no danger of wearing thrid-bare:
O my Love o, etc.
She has a Chin, and a chopping one,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
She might spare half on it for her that has none;
But now her long Chin, I will let that alone:
O my Love o, there is none etc.
Her Neck does shine like a Chimney stock,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
When she her Casket of Pleasures unlock,
I am caught as the Miller did catch his Mare Brock:
O my Love o, etc
Her downy Breasts are swingers indeed,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
She may carry them on her shoulders for need,
O she is a brave Less we want more of her breed;
With o my Love o, there is none does know
how I do love thee.
The second Part,
To the same tune.




HEr shoulders I think, they are a whole yard square,
I love my Lov^ and Lov^ and ^h^e loves me:
Sh^^l brave out her labor ^ou need not to fear,
Give me such a Less that is able to bear.
O my love O, there is none does know
How I do love thee.
Like wise she has good lusty strong Arms,
I love my love and she loves me:
They are able to attend her body from harms,
To set forth her praises it me much concerns,
O my love O, there is none etc.
He^ hand like (...) shoulder of Mutton appesres,
I love my Love and she ^^veth me:
But I would not have he^ f^^ about mine ears,
(...) my love there is no Less that dares,
O my love O, there is none etc.
She has strong post legs her body to bear,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
She need dread no failing, that she does not fear
But if that you throw her, she will show you a Bear
O my love O, there is none etc.
Her fine dainty Foot is of the fourteens,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
And I can tell you that completely it seems,
I must speak her pr^ises cause love is between's,
O my love O, there is none etc.
If I should marry with one that were proud,
I love my Love and she loves me:
She would desire more then can well be alowd,
From such haughty creatures my self I will shroud,
O my love O, there is none etc.
And if I should marry with one that is fair,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
Perhaps Cornu^ing might fall to my share,
And so she might work me unto much dispare,
O my love O, there is none does know
how I do love thee.
And if I should chance to wed one that is small,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
Then she is not able to do ought at all,
And yet she will be apt to scold and to brall,
O my love O, there is none etc.
If I should chance for to marry a scold,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
Then I must always by her be controld,
And then my liberty would be quite sold,
O my love O, there is none etc.
Well, I my choice of the first mean to keep,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
For she will be quiet when she is asleep,
And our affections are settled deep:
O my love O, there is none etc.
Thus to conclude, you that hear my Song,
I love my Love, and she loves me:
When I am wedded I Will praise my wives tongue,
But then it never shall do me once wrong.
With O my Love o, there is none does know
How I do love thee.
