A very Godly SONG, entitled, the Earnest Petition of the faithful Christian,
being Clerk of Badnam, made upon his Deathbed, at the Instant of his
Transumation.
To a sweet solemn Tune.



NOw my painful eyes lie rolling,
And my Passing Bell is towling,
Towling sweetly, I lie dying,
And my life is from me flying.
Grant me strength, O gracious God,
For to endure thy heavy Rod,
Then shall I rejoice and sing,
With Psalms unto our heavenly King.
Simeon that blessed man,
Believed Christ when he was come,
And then he did desire to dye,
To live with him Eternally.
Christ wrote me a strong Salvation.
By his bitter death and passion;
He had wash d and ma^^ me c ean,
That I should never sin again.
Grievous pains does call and cry,
O Man prepare thy self to dye:
All my Sins I have lamented,
And to d^e I am contented.
Silly Soul the Lord receive thee,
Death is come, and life must leave thee
Death wi l t^r^y no man's leisure,
Then farewell all earth^y pleasure.
In this world I nothing crave,
But to bring me to my Grave;
In my Grave while I lie sleeping,
Angels have my soul in keeping.
When the bells are for me ringing,
Lord receive my soul with singing:
Then shall I be free from pain,
To live and never dye again.
While the worms corrupting breed on,
Wait my noisome Corpse to feed on,
My fervent soul this prison loathing.
Craves a Robe of Angels clothing.
Farewell world and worldly Glory,
Farewell all things transitory,
Sion Hill my Soul ascends,
And Gods Royal throne attends.
Farewell Wife and children small,
For I must go when Christ does call:
And for my death be ye content
When I am gone do not lament.
Now the Bell does cease to toul,
Sweet Jesus Christ receive my soul.


O God which did the world create,
Hear a poor sinner at the Gate,
Thou that from death did set me free
Remit my sins and show mercy.
O thou that caused thy blessed Son,
Into this Universe to come:
Thy Gospel true for to fulfill,
And to subdue Sin, Death, and Hell.
Grant for his sake that died on tree,
On the blessed Mount of Calvary:
That I being grieved for my sin,
Might by repentance Heaven w^n
The Gospel says, who so believe,
To them will thou a blessing give,
Amongst which number grant me faith
That to believe the Gospel says.
Which to believe grant that I may,
Though here I dye, yet live for aye,
Then savior sweet remit my si^
And grant me faith that life to win.
And since thy death a price most great,
Has bought us here I do entreat
To give me Grace thy name to praise,
Both now and evermore always.
For by thy death my soul is free
From Hell, which still by thy decree
To sinners, all for sin is due,
Until thy Son our Savior true.
Did vanquish by almighty power,
Death, Hell, and all that could devour
My sins, O Lord, I do confess,
Like sands in Seas are numberless.
Yet though my sins like scarlet show,
Their whiteness may exceed the snow,
If thou thy mercy do extend,
That I my sinful life may mend.
With mercy thy blessed word does say,
At any time obtain I may,
If power and grace in me remain,
From carnal sin for to restrain.
Then give me grace, Lord to abstain
Fro ^ sin, that I may still remain
With thee in heaven where angels sing
Most joyfully to thee our King.
God grant, O Christ, that when I dye,
My ^^ul with thee immediately,
May have abode among the blessed
And live for ever in true rest.
Printed for W Thackeray in Ducklane.
