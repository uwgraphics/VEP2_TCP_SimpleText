The Loyal Subjects exultation, for the Coronation of King Charles the Second.
To the Tune of, When the King comes home in Peace again.


WHat Writers could Prognosticate
Concerning Englands happy fate?
Lilly (I think) had little wit
That night his threshold was besh it,
his Almanacks told
King Charles never should
Return to rule on English ground,
but Lilly's a Liar,
like the Devil his Sire,
For now our Sovereign Charles is crowned.
What Is now become of Lamberts power,
Alas bee's Prisoner in the Tower:
Better days will now ensue,
Than ever yet poor England knew.
then well may we sing
for joy of our King,
And in good Sack our sorrows drowned
for Charles is returned,
and the old Rump's burned,
And now our Sovereign Charles is crowned.
Well may our hearts with jey abound,
He that was twelve years lost is found,
And they that once were in his Palace,
Have made their beds under the Gallows,
for Justice thought good,
that such as thrist for blood,
Should under go deaths cruel wound,
and after did bring
a Crown to the King,
For now our Sovereign Charles, etc.
We saw a change on every side,
The Rump revived when Cromwell died.
And that Protector puppy Dick,
They from his Highness soon did kick.
and down from her Throne,
they tumbled old Joan,
Whereby her grief did much abound,
for a General stout
turned them also out,
And now our Royal King is crowned.
The second part,
to the same Tune.


ENgland was but a senseless trunck,
Until she was restored by Monck,
Who in despite of Rump and Soldiers,
Has set her head upon her Shoulders.
where long let it stand
to rule and command
And be throughout the world renowned
let all honest men,
say Amen, and Amen,
For now our Sovereign Charles is crowned.
Welcome, welcome, happy light,
The Sun never saw a braver sight,
Solomon was a wise Prince
The like till now, was never known since,
let all tongues with joy
cry Vive le roy,
And cast their Caps upon the ground
let him ever be sad
that now is not glad,
When as our Sovereign, etc.
The Serving-man of Mistress Lane,
Is now our Lord and Sovereign,
He that stood by the kitchen fire
Is now advanced a little higher,
though skill he did lack
to wind up the Jack,
Yet wisdom in his heart was found,
and Traitors must know
though they then brought him low,
That now most gloriously he is crowned.
See how the loyal hearts prepare
Their stately shows and Pageants rare
The weeping Conduits now combine
To turn their water into wine,
and London appears
(though stricken in years)
Just like a Virgin fresh and gay,
such comfort a King
to his Subjects does bring,
Upon his Coronation day.
Time was when we were stricken dumb,
We might not pray (thy Kingdom come)
But now a glorious time we see,
The Gods rejoice as well as we,
the Nymphs of the floods,
and they of the woods
That wear the Livery of May,
the Birds of the air
their parts they did bear,
Upon his Coronation day.
Lord bless the King, and blast the hope
Of all false hearts that love the Pope,
And frustrate all the wicked plots
Of the Phanaticks and the Scots,
Oh may we increase
in Plenty and Peace
That after this blessed time we may
in spite of all those
that have been our foes,
See many another happy day.
FINIS.
