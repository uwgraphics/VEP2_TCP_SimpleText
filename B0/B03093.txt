Englands Darling, OR Great Britains Joy and hope on that Noble PRINCE JAMES
Duke of MONMOUTH.
Brave Monmouth, Englands Glory,
Hated of none but Papist and Tory,
May thou in thy Noble Fathers love remain,
who happily over this Land does Reign.
Tune of, Young Jemmy, or Philander.




YOung Jemmy is a Lad
that is Royally descended;
With every Virtue clad,
by every Tongue commended:
A true and faithful English heart,
Great Britains joy and hope,
And bravely will maintain their part
in spite of Turk and Pope.
Young Jemmy is a Lad
that hates all base pretenses;
No Tory, Masquerade,
with Popish sham-pretences:
A Heart and Soul so great and just,
such Conduct and Command,
A Champion in his Countries trust
young Jemmy still will stand.
Young Jemmy is a youth
who thinks it no transgression
To stand up for the Truth,
and Protestant Profession:
But Oh! he sights with such success,
all mortal powers obey,
No god of war but must confess
young Jemmy hears the sway.




At Jemmy's powerful voice
the Drums and Trumpets sounded;
And England did rejoice
when Jemmy's fame abounded.
Of Jemmy the victorious name
did through all Europe fly,
And all the nations did proclaim
his mate less Gallantry.
In Mastricht, and in France,
in Germany, and Flanders,
Young Jemmy did advance
amongst the chief Commanders:
By Sea and Land his fame did fly,
and all the Nations round,
Of Jemmy's constant victory
and valor did resound,
In Scotland Jemmy's hand
dispersed the Whigg and Tory,
And B^thwel Bridge will stand
to his eternal glory.
There he the Rebels force withstood,
and did their Might oppose,
Both for the King and Countries good,
in spite of all his foes.
But oh! unhappy fates!
a curse on Pride and Malice;
The Popish plotting States
have banish^d him the Palace.
They turned him out of grace of late,
of dignity and fame,
And every mighty place of State,
yet Jemmy's still the same.
Maliciously they plot
(against all sense and reason)
Against Shaftsbury and Scot,
to Cloak their Popish Treason:
Tories and Papists all agree
to blast his spotless fame,
But 'spight of all their policy,
young Jemmy's still the same.
For still to lose his blood
young Jemmy does importune,
And for his Countries good,
to spend his Life and Fortune
For to support the Church and State,
our Liberties and Laws,
Against their Malice, Plots, and Hate,
that wou^d our rights oppose.
Let all good men implore
for Jemmy's Restoration,
Whose conduct must restore
the ruins of our Nation:
That he to Charles's praise may live,
our freedom to maintain,
When Jemmy shall his fame ret^eive
and rein grace again.
