The Obsequy of fair Phillida With the Shepherds and Nymphs lamentation for
her loss.
To a new Court Tune.


THe fairest Nymph that vallyes
Or Mountains ever bred,
The shepherds joy,
So beautiful and coy,
Fair Phillida is dead;
On whom they often have tended,
And carol'd on the Plains
And for her sake
Sweet Roundelayes did make,
Admired by rural Swains:
But cruel Fates the beauties envying
Of this blooming Rose,
So ready to disclose,
With a frost unkindly
Nipt the bud untimely,
So away her glory goes.
The Sheep for woe go bleating,
That they their Goddess miss,
And sable Ewes,
By their mournful shows,
Her absence, cause of this;
The Nymphs leave off their dancing,
Pans Pipe of joy is cleft;
For great's his grief,
He shunneth all relief,
Since she from him is reft.
Come, fatal Sisters, leave there your spooles
Leave mourning altogether,
That made this flower to wither:
Let envy, that foul Vipresse,
Put on a wreath of Cypress,
Singing sad Dirges altogether.
Diana was chief mourner,
At these sad Obsequies,
Who with her train
Went tripping ore the Plains,
Singing doleful Elegies:
Menalchus and Amyntas,
And many Shepherds more,
With mournful Verse,
Did all attend her Hearse,
And in sable sadly go:
Flora, the Gods that used to beautify
Fair Phillis lovely bowers,
With sweet fragrant flowers,
Now her grave adorned,
And with flowers mourned.
Tears thereon in vain she powers.
Venus alone triumphed,
To see this dismal day,
Who did despair,
That Phillida the fair
Her laws would nere obey.
The blinded boy his arrows
And Darts were vainly spent:
Her heart, alas,
Inpenetrable was,
And to love would nere assent:
At which affront Citharea repined,
'Cause death with his Dart,
Had pierced her tender heart:
Bat her noble spirit
Does such joys inherit,
Which from her shall nere depart.
A Ballad Entitled, The Old Man's Complaint against his Wretched Son, who to
Advance his Marriage, did undo himself.
To the same Tune.




ALL you that fathers be,
look on my misery,
Let not affection fond
work your extremity,
For to advance my son
in marriage wealthily,
I have my self undone
without all remedy.
I that was wont to live
uncontrolled any way,
With many checks and taunts
am grieved every day:
Alack and woe is me
I that might late command,
Cannot have a bit of bread
but at my Childrens hand.
While I was wont to sit
chief at the tables end,
Now like a Servant slave
must I on them attend,
I must not come in place
where their friends merry be,
Lest I should my son disgra^e
with my unreverency,
my Coughing in the night
offends my daughter in law,
my Deafness and ill-sight
does much disliking draw.
Fie on this doting fool,
this crooked Churl (quoth she)
The Chimney corner still
must with him troubled be,
I must rise from my Chair
to give my children place.
I must speak servants fair,
this is my woeful case.
Unto their friends they tell
( I must not say they lie)
That they do keep me her^
even of mere charity.
When I am sick in bed
they will not come me nigh,
Each day they wish me dead
yet say i will never die:
O Lord an't be thy will
look on my woeful case,
No honest man before
ever took such disgrace.
This was the Old-mans plaint
every night and day,
With woe he waxed faint,
but mark what I shall say.
This rich and dainty pair,
the young man and his wife,
Though clogged with golden coin,
yet led a grievous life.
Seven years they married were,
and yet in all that space,
God sent them never an heir
their Riches to embrace:
Thus did their sorrow breed,
joy was from them exiled,
Quoth she, a hundred pound
would I give for a Child,
to have a joyful Child
of my own body.
Full often I am reviled
of this my barren womb,
much Physic did she take
to make a fruitful Soil,
And with access thereof
her body she did spoil.
Full of grief, full of pain,
full of each grew she then,
that she cries out amain,
seek for some cunning men,
that I my health may have,
I will no money spare.
But that which she did crave
never fell to her share.
Alack alack, she said,
what torments I live in,
How well are they apaid
that truly ease can win:
So that I had my health,
and from this pain was free,
I would give all my wealth
that blessed day to see.
O that my health I had,
though I were never so poor,
I cared not though I went
begging from door to door,
fie on this muck, quoth she,
it cannot pleasure me,
in this my woeful case
and great extremity.
thus lived she long in pain,
all comfort from her fled,
She strangled at the last
her self within the bed*
Her husband full of grief
consumed woefully,
His body pined away,
suddenly he did die.
E're thirteen years was past
died he without a will,
And by this means at last
the Old man, living still,
Enjoyed his Land at last,
after much misery,
Many Years after that
lived he most happily,
far richer than before,
by this means was he known
He helped the sick and sore,
the poor man overthrown.
But this was all his Song,
let all men understand,
those Parents are accursed,
lives on their childrens hand.
