the Honorable Sir Clowdsly Shovel, and of several of their Widows.
THAT they are in Arrears of full Pay from the 17th. of February 1696/7, to the
Time of their being Disbanded, being the 11th. of September, School. which is
above Twenty One Months; during which time They never received any Subsistence.

THAT they stand no ways Charged with any Encumbrances whatsoever, which may
affect this their Pay.

THAT the Parliament did Appropriate Money for the two Marine Regiments for
this very time they are in Arrears, which has never been Paid them.

THAT most of them have Contracted several Debts upon the Credit of their said
Pay, which is like to prove Destructive to them, their Creditors Suing them for
the same, which they are no ways able to pay without their Arrears.

And in Regard some of the Lieutenants of the same Regiment by particular
Favor from the late Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, have Received their
Arrears for the Time aforesaid.

It is therefore Humbly Hoped, That this Honorable House will take their said
particular Case and Hardship into Consideration, and Order them such Relief
therein, as to your Honors Justice shall seem meet, They having made due
Application both to the late Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and
Commissioners of the Navy, but without Effect.

(...) Second Marine Regiment and of several of their Widows*
