CUPIDS POSIES,

For Bracelets, Handkercers, and Rings,
With Scarfes, Gloves, and other things.
Written by Cupid on a day,
When Venus gave me leave to play,
Verbum sat amanti.
The Lover shows his intent,
By Gifts that are with posies sent.
Cupid draws his bow

London, Printed by E. C. for J. Wright, next to the Globe in Little-Brittain,
1674.

To his Mother VENUS. Cupid Dedicateth his Posies.
MOther your Love to me was shown
Before that I could go alone,
For with Nectar then you fed me,
And in tender manner bred me:
Till perceiving once that I
Was able on my wings to fly;
I did descend unto the Earth,
With my Bow to make some mirth:
For all the World is my park,
Where when I shoot I hit the Mark;
Young Men and Maidens are my Game,
While I the little Bowman am;
Yet lest you may think my leisure
(...) do only waste in pleasure:
These Posies I have writ of late,
Which to you I dedicate:
That so the love may be expressed,
Of your son that loves you best.

Whilst I here do live.
Love joyneth hands,
In wedlock bands.

And will disclose the sighing Lovers grief;
For Cupid having too much idle leisure,
Composed these Posies for his pleasure.

Each frown of yours is like a Dart,
That wounds me unto the heart.
What conquest were it, if that I

To kiss your lips and cheeks desirous be.
On the choice of a Wife.
If thou intend'st to choose a wife,
With whom to lead a happy life:
Look not for beauty since there are,
Few that can be chaste and fair:
But if thou do her virtues find,
Which is the beauty of the mind:
Woe her then to gain consent,
For virtuous Love can never repent.
Cupids Conclusion.
Fair Maids my posies now are done,
Which for yours sakes I first begun,
And young men here may always choose,
Such posies as they mean to use:
I Cupid writ them on a day.
When Venus gave me leave to play:
And if you like them for my pain,
Then Cupid means to write again.
FINIS.
