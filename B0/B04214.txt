An Excellent New SONG, CALLED, The Ruined Virgin, OR, The Hard-hearted
Young Man.
To an Excellent new Playhouse Tune.
With Allowance.



I.
YOu pretty Maidens all I pray give Ear,
Unto my Downfall which I declare,
Of Parentage I am
Near to a Gentleman,
As some now witness can the date of Year.
II.
At fourteen years of Age with griefs I tell,
Many a young man fair loved me well,
I being Childish young,
Believed a flattering tongue,
And fixed my mind upon a brisk young man.
III.
He said if I would not yield with him to dwell,
He would go hang himself what e're befell,
He rung and tore his hair,
And wickedly did swear,
His sword should end the care before me then.
IV.
I hearing what he said grieved me sore,
I took him for my Friend not for my Foe,
Young man, said I, forbear,
I pray let go your hair,
I Will ease you of your care, and be your Bride.
V.
O how he Jumpt for joy before me then,
My love and only joy happies the man,
He kindly me embraced,
And hung about my Waste,
And then my love I placed on this young man.
VI.
For two months space and more he Courted me
Day by Day, Night by Night he set by me,
He let me take no rest
I must sleep on his Breast,
And then my Love I placed on this young man.
VII.
The appointed day was set we were to wed,
But first of all he stole my maidenhead,
My Parents did not know,
I loved this young man so,
Which proved my overthrow, ruined me quite
VIII.
When I with Child did prove and him had told,
He called me twenty Whores brafen and bold
I know you not, says he,
Therefore be gone from me,
This proved my misery, his love was cold.
IX.
I was ashamed to stay where I was known,
For straight away I went from my own home,
I wandered up and down
From Seaport town to town,
Till in travel I fell down in the highway.
X.
Then taken up I were by women kind,
whose friendship they did show nature did bind
Delivered then I were
Of two fine Babies fair,
which caused me much care bewarn'd by me.
