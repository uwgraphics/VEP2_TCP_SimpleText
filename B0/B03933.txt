TO THE READER.
UPON a late Dispute concerning the Author of the Book, Entitled, Eikon
Basilike, it was by some affirmed, that they had the first Impression of the
said Book with Prayers as they are now Printed and added to the End thereof,
(by one of the Impressions in 12o. of the King's Works, printed in 1650. at the
Hague by Sam. Brown; in the said Book are diverse of his Majesty's Prayers,
whereof the three last used by him in the time of his Restraint, were delivered
to the Bishop of London at his death, from whom they were taken away by the
Officers of the Army, and amongst these Six Prayers, that entitled to be said
in Time of Captivity, and taken out of Sir Phillip Sidney 's Arcadia, is not
one of them, however it came to be printed and added in some Editions of them.)
As to which being desirous to know the Truth as well for my own as others
satisfaction, I endeavored to make as full a search as I could, and to that
end, did not only enquire at the Booksellers Shops in London and Westminster,
but as far as my Interest would permit me, did cause to be made search both in
Private Libraries of several Gentlemen, and Divines, and Public ones at
Oxford, etc. (having before seen several of those which were affirmed as
aforesaid to be the first Edition) where I found the abovementioned Twenty
Eight several Impressions or Editions of the King's Book without the Prayers,
and the Twenty Seven Editions with the Prayers added at the End of the said
Book; all which being transmitted to me, I took the said Account with all the
exactness I could, by noting (lest there should happen any mistake) the size of
the Volumn, the time of Printing, the number of Leaves the Contents did consist
of, and the number of the Pages, all which I testify under my hand

At the Turks-head in Fleet Street, June the 15th. 1693. SAMUEL KEBLE.

I shall insert a Letter, transcribed from the Original, which I have by me,
written by Mr. Levet.

The Superscription of the said Letter runs thus, For Seymor Bowman, Esquire near
the Arch in Lincolns-Inn-Fields.
Dear Brother, Licensed, May the 10th. 1691. By Z. Isham.
YOurs of the 21th. of this instant April I received, and one Letter before
that to the same effect, viz. To give a true Account of my knowledge of that
unparalled Book, which his Sacred Majesty, of ever blessed Memory, King
Charles the First (murdered by his own Rebellious Subjects before his own
Palace at Whitehall, with all the violent and malicious Circumstances that
Wicked men could invent) which Book, of my certain Knowledge, I can depose, was
truly His own, having observed His Majesty oftentimes writing His Royal
Resentments of the bold and insolent behavior of His Soldiers (His Rebellious
Subjects) when they had Him in their custody. I waited on His Majesty as Page
of the Bedchamber in ordinary during all the time of His Solitudes, (except
when I was forced from Him) and especially being nominated by His Majesty to be
one of His Servants, amongst others, that should attend Him during the Treaty
at Newport in the Isle of Wight, had the happiness to read the same oftentimes
in Manuscript under His Majesty's own Hand, being pleased to leave it in the
Window in His own Bedchamber, where I was always obliged to attend His
Majesty's coming thither. But the Treaty being ended in few days after, the
Soldiers with one to conduct them, by name Mr. Anthony Mildmay then
Cup Bearer, came to the Bedchamber, about Two of the Clock in the Night, and
knocked at the Door, and one Mr. Herbert, Mr. Kirk, and my self having some
hint of their Intentions, were watching in an inward Room, and hearing the
noise, went into His Majesty's Bedchamber, and asked, who they were that durst
disturb His Majesty at that unseasonable time of the Night, who answered, they
were sent to tell the King, He must rise and go with them. We acquainting His
Majesty with their Design, He was pleased to command us to tell them, He would
go with them, but it was not His usual hour to rise so soon, we again
acquainted the Soldiers with His Majesty's Answer. They instead of complying
with His Majesty, bid us tell Him, if He did not rise presently, they must
force Him to it: His Majesty only said, if I must, give me my Clothes, and so
He immediately arose. (Here you may observe a mirror of Patience in a
distressed Prince.) During the time of His Majesty's making himself ready, he
concerned himself only how to secure this Book of his, and a small Cabinet,
wherein he secured his Letters to his Queen, who was then beyond the Sea, and
His Majesty having procured a Pass for me from the Governor, that I should
wait on him there; He gave me in charge this said Book and small Cabinet, which
I faithfully presented to His Majesty's own hands that Night in Hurst-Castle.
But the Governor, by what information is too tedious to insert here at this
time, and therefore I omit it, did on the Saturday banish me out of the Castle.

I should have sent you a Relation which I had from Royston, the King's
Printer, for the Printing the said Book by His Majesty's especial Command,
brought to him by a Divine, but not to be By Printed, is to be understood,
Published.
printed till after the King's death, which he observed accordingly, for which
Cromwell sent for him to Whitehall, not only promising Rewards, but also
threatening Punishment, if he would not deny, that he printed it by His
Majesty's Order, which he refusing to do, did imprison him for about a
Fortnight, but seeing he could not work upon him, released him; which is all at
present from

From Savernack Park near Marlborough, Apr. 29. 1691. Your Affectionate
Brother, To serve you WILLIAM LEVETT.
