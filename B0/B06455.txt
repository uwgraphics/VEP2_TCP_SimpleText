Virginity grown Troublesome: OR, The Younger Sisters Lamentation for want of a
Husband.
Being a most pleasant and Delightful New Song much in use, etc.
Each Age grows Riper, love does still prevail,
And Maiden-heads at Sixteen now are stale;
Young Girls to Mothers will be turned e're they
Know what it means, sly Cupid does betray,
Fires them with love, and then there is nothing can
Cure their distemper, unless Oil of Man.

I Have a good old Mother at home,
which keeps me from Wedlock still,
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never have my will.
As I walked forth within the fields,
to see the Bushes spring;
The little Birds they changed their notes,
and I heard the Cuckoo sing.
My Sister is married to her content,
and is made a wedded Wife;
And with her Husband she does live,
a sweet contented life.
But I poor soul must lie alone,
who am more fair than she;
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never, etc.
There is never a one in all the Town,
that can compare with me:
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never Married be.

NOw I must into some far Country,
or into some foreign Land;
For to find out a bonny Lad,
to be at my command.
Love pleasures all things do surpass,
as I do plainly see;
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never married be.
Come some brisk Lad, O come with speed,
and me from care set free;
O what shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never, etc.
Alas, for what was beauty made,
was it only for to see:
What shall I do, I am afraid
I never shall, etc.
To languish thus is worse then death,
some sweet youth come wedd me;
What shall I loose my Virgin breath,
and never Married be.
Kind Heaven my Sister did befriend,
whilst none's more loved then she:
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never Married be.
Good Cupid at some gentle heart
let thy swift Arrow flee;
Will no kind Young Man take my part,
that I may Married be.
O cruel young men, what do you mean,
from joy to hinder me;
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never married be.
Is it my Portions smallness then,
that make you not agree;
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never married be.
If it be that i will make it more,
to labor i will be free;
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never married be.
Oh how I sigh to lie alone,
and wish for Company;
What shall I do, shall I make moan,
and never married be.
To tear my Hair I scarce refrain,
when Weddings I do see;
What shall I always feel this pain,
and never married be.
How blessed are they who in each Grove,
receive embraces free,
What shall I do, shall I dye for love,
and never married be.
Then some kind youth come plvck the fruit
from blooming beauty's Tree:
What shall I dye, in this dispute,
and never married be.
These twenty years now have I lived,
and none e're asked me:
Let me not dye, kind youths for love,
and never married be.
