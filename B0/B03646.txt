Hey ho Hunt about. OR,
A pretty merry meeting of young men and Maids,
Who went to the Tavern by Cupids strong aids,
They drank and were merry and sang a new Song,
They talked and discoursed but did no body wrong,
They kindly embraced, and each other did kiss,
You know there could be no great harm in this.
The Tune is, the Courageous hartulesse healths.

In a good honest sort,
And in friendship to pass time away.
VV^ paint not our Faces,
Nor powder our Traces,
Nor hudle up our heads in black bags
The Scarffs that some wear,
If well looked on they were,

Our habits are civil
And we think no evil,
Our hearts and our minds do agree,
And now my sweet heart,
Before we depart,
In love here is a full cup to thee.

We Will pay thee for all etc.
Hey ho let us drink,
Fill the cup to the brink,
And so let this health go round,
Like sister and brother,
We Will pledge one another,
Our joys shall with Nector be crowned
Like sister, etc.
And thus the brave Lasses,
Did tipple up the glasses,
Their sweet hearts being in company then
To sweeten their wine,
With kisses most fine,
They showed themselves kind hearted men
With kisses, etc.
And being kind hearted,
Before they departed,
E^c^ lad took his leave of his sweeting
And promised them,
To be merry again,
And pointed a time for their meeting.
And then, etc.
Though they so merry were,
With wine and merry cheer
No harm was thought spoken or meant.
The day being done,
Each one to his home,
Departed with love and content.
