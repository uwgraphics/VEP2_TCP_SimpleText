Directions for Damsels, OR The Maidens advice, in an answer to the Young-mens
Counselor.
You that a kind good Husband lack
Let me with you prevail,
To choose a Brown or curious Black,
These colors never fail.
Tune of, All Trades.
This may be Printed,

R.P.







O Now I have counseled young men
what Wives they have reason to choose;
I tell the young Damsels again,
what Husbands they ought to refuse
Beware of fair men that can joke,
with every Wind they can wave,
And will your kind spirits provoke,
and make you an absolute Slave.
But as for the Brown and the Black,
they both have a notable smack:
Young Women may find them loving and kind,
they will give them whatever they lack.
Never marry one with a wey Beard,
He is of the fumbling Crew;
Of such I have often times heard,
they little or nothing can do;
And therefore, I pray now take heed,
all Wey-Beards forever refrain;
For when you are married indeed,
it is never the near to complain.
But as for the Brown, etc,
The Sandy Complexion are Sots,
and given to anger and strife,
Who ever has such to their lots,
they need no more plague in their life.
From Alehouse to Alehouse they will trudge,
and make their Wives take all the care,
Too often they make them their Drudge,
of Sandy Complexion beware.
But as for the Brown and the Black,
they both have a notable smack:
Young-women may find them loving and kind,
(...)


The Flaxen, though never so complete,
and by the young Damsels adored,
Yet are they as full of deceit,
as all the whole World can afford.
They Will flatter, dissemble, and lie,
poor innocent Girls to betray;
And if to their will you comply,
they will pack up their Awls and away.
But as for the Brown and the Black,
they both have a notable smack:
What promise they make they will never forsake,
they scorn to be found to fly back.
Beware of the Yellow curled locks,
such men are both wanton and wild;
They Will play with the fine Holland Smocks,
and get the young Lasses with Child:
For pleasure abroad they will Roam,
and lay the young Females along,
Yet they will do but little at home.
what Woman can bear with this wrong.
But as for the Brown and the Black,
they both have a notable smack:
Young-women may find them loving and kind,
they will give them whatever they lack.
The Swarthy I cannot forget;
and now to give them their desert,
They have neither Beauty nor Wit,
nor any commendable part:
And therefore Remember the word,
take no such lad sorrowful soul;
They say they have need of a Bird,
that will give a Groat for an Owl.
But as for the Brown, etc.
Beware of the head that is Gray,
old-men they will jealousy breed,
And think that the wanton you play,
although you be honest indeed,
He Is chilly and cold in his blood,
and never a Tooth in his Iaw;
He Will do a young Wife no more good
than tickle her Tale with a Straw.
But as for the Brown, etc.
The Flaxen and Gray I forbid,
with Sandy, for bad is the best:
But now I am come to the Red,
which is seven times worse than the rest,
He Is full of ill humors, therefore
he stinks, let him do what he can,
As Ramish as any old Bore:
what Woman can love such a Man.
But as for the Brown etc.
Young Men that are freckled and fair,
are commonly given to lies:
But black men and brown I declare,
are known to be virtuous and wise,
They hate for to wrangle and brawl,
they honor and nourish their Wives,
And never will wrong them at all,
But love them as dear as their lives.
Stand up for the Brown, etc.
Young Damsels of every degree,
Whose Beauty does Batchelors charm,
Come buy this New Ditty of me,
good counsel can do you no harm;
Though formerly you have bought many:
this may keep your days free from strife,
And then it will be the best Penny
as e're you laid out in your life.
Then Hey for the Brown and the Black,
they both have a notable smack:
Young Women may find them loving and kin
they will give them whatever they lack.
Printed for I Deacon, at the Angel in Guiltspur-street, without Newgate.
