MY fairest my dearest
i have heard what thou'st told
I vallue thy words more

Matter not for Riches
for thou shall have store,
If thou will go with thy Love
all the world over.
As thou do forsake Father
and Mother beside,
I Will make as much on thee
what ever betide,
Thou shall be my Comrade
on Sea or on Shore,
Then come and go with etc.
Though we travel to Rome Love
to France or to Spain,
Yet do not you fear
but we shall turn again,
I Will secure thee from the Tiger
the Wolf and the Bore,
Then come, etc.
As thou art so constant
and steadfast in mind,
As faithful a friend
thou ever shall find,
Then assure thy self
i will wrong thee on no score,
Then come, etc.
ANd if thou go with me
i will promise thee fair,
Instead of one boy Love
i will get thee a pair,
I Will hug thee and kiss thee
thy joys to restore,
Then come and go with thy Love
all the world over.
Though Sir Guy and St. George
did venture their lives,
I Will do as much for thee
as they did for their wives,
I Will be thy Champion
against thousands and more,
Then come, etc.
He that seeks for to wrong thee
i will venture my Life,
And you will say a man can do
no more for a Wife,
But fight for a Sweetheart
in battles so sore,
Then, etc.
Hang him from his dearest
will once stir or flinch,
Or hang him if he loves her
will not fight for a VVench,
Then give us more liquor
though we run on the score,
And come etc.
I Will show thee what fashions
Europe can devise,
It may be by our travel
we to fortune may rise,
Thou know not what blessings
the Lord has in store,
Then come etc.
For to stay at home Love
and sit by the fire,
There Is no recreation
unto thy desire.
Then lets to the fair Love
where music is store,
Then, etc.
Love never be daunted
nor yet do not fear,
But I will be faithful
unto thee my Dear,
No tongue nor yet beauty
shall thy fame adore,
Then, etc.
He that would wrong thee
is worse then a jew,
And he is a Knave
that will not prove true,
Such doings I hate
and shall love thee the more,
Then; etc.
Though I don't praise thy feature
as thou have done mine,
Yet i will stick as close to thee
as the Bark to the Vine,
Therefore do not tarry
but bar up the door,
Then, etc.
And thus my own dearest
i have told thee my mind,
And nothing but truth
thou by me shall find,
Then take this kiss
for i will now say no more
But come and go with thy Love
all the world over.
