The Batchelour's GVIDE, And the married Man's Comfort.
A good Wife she is the comfort of a Man,
If a Man be careful to comfort her again;
For Love is so rare a thing to see,
Betwixt Man and Wife, if they do well agree:
But where Man and Wife does live at the Debate,
They say the Curse of God does lie at the Gate,
Therefore honest young Men and Maids have a care
I desire when you are married to live in God's fear:
And those that are Married and has been long wed,
To make much of there Wives both at Board and at Bed;
And let them be careful they do not offend
But be true to their Husband to the latter end.
To the Tune of, The Sorrowful Damsels Lamentation for want of a Husband.
This may be Printed,

ALl Batchelors now, come hearken to me,
Both Richard and Robert and Harry truly,
When you are minded a wooing to go,
Observe but these words, is the best way to do so;
I Will make it appear in what I declare,
In Country and City it is every where,
A Wife that is loving, we may say it again,
You cannot love her too much, she deserves a good Man.
A good Wife that is saving every way,
Will never wrong her Husband, nor let things go astray
When a Wife that is given to drink and to sot,
Will then let fly all that her Husband has got,
Though he do take pains, she will spend all the gains,
And junket about with other foul Queans:
A Wife that is loving,
But a Wife that is virtuous, and one that fears God,
Will honor her Husband in deed and in word,
She never will cross him not in the least thing,
But will make all things well, if any anger begin,
With fair Words she will labor his love for to win,
She will be so obedient I say unto him:
A Wife that is loving,
But A Wife that is for Pride and a lazy life,
She'^l weary her Husband all the days of his Life;
That Man that has her has something to do,
He needs go no further to find out a Foe:
If a Man gets never so much, and might and strive,
His Wife must give leave if ever he thrive:
A Wife that is saving, we may say it again,
You cannot love her too much, she deserves a good man.
If a young couple have but little withal to begin
if they love one another their Goods will increase,
What he gets out of doors she will save within:
if he be a angry Man, she will strive to make peace,
When a careless Wife that is given to strife,
Will weary her Husband quite out of his life:
But a Wife of mild nature, may say it again,
You cannot love her too much she deserves a good Man.






Therefore honest young men take counsel by me,
let not great Portions your hearts bewitch,
For that will never make a good Housewife you see,
it is not money altogether will make a Man rich;
The reason for why, I Will tell you truly,
a Girl with a great Portion looks to be maintained high:
A good conditioned Wife let us say it again,
Deserves a great praise, and a right honest Man.
But he that has a good Wife is happy I say,
if he takes pains to labor his Living to get,
She Will not spend it abroad in an idle way,
she will work the Skin off her fingers to keep him out of debt
She Will give him good counsel, if he will it receive,
And set him at all times in a way for to live:
That Woman is a Treasure and the life of a Man
He cannot love her too much let him do what he can.
But young men you will say, how should a Man know
which way for to choose a good Wife from a bad?
Now I am resolved to lay out to your show,
and give you directions to make your hearts glad.
Take one of good carriage and one that is civil,
for some are too cunning I think for the Devil:
Then if you meet with an honest good Woman I swear
You cannot love her too much nor think nothing too dear.
Do not take a great Liar, nor one that will swear,
Nor one that will be Drunk, she will never take care,
Take one that is civil and modest withal,
That gives no offense to great nor to small.
There is difference in Women, young men you may see
If you marry a good one be ruled by me:
That will be loving and saving every way,
She Will make much of her Husband by night and by day.
If a Man he be minded to choose him a Wife,
Choose one of good carriage to avoid evil strife,
And let him be careful of choosing a slut,
In dressing his Diet she may poison his Gut;
But a cleanly good Women that goes civil and neat
A Man needs not fear any bad thing in his Meat:
That Man that does meet with so virtuous a Wife,
Let him love her as dear as he loves his own life.
Concluding my Ditty let all Men be wise,
To make much of your Wives I do you advize,
And let not your Children and them live in want,
But work and take pains the same to prevent,
That Man that does marry a good Woman indeed,
She deserves have his love, then the better he will speed:
For where love is wanting betwixt Man and Wife,
It never comes to good, but great sorrow and grief.
