The Sea-mans Compass
OR A dainty new Ditty composed and pend
The deeds of brave Seamen to praise and commend,
'Twas made by a Maid that to Gravesend did pass,
Now mark, and you quickly shall hear how it was:

To the Tune of, The Tyrant has stolen.


AS lately I traveled,
toward Gravesend,
I heard a fair Damosel
a Seaman commend
And as in a Tilt-boat
we passed along
In praise of brave Seamen
she sung this new Song
Come Tradesman or Merchant,
whoever he be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me,
A Seaman in promise
is faithful and just
Honest in carriage
and true to his trust
Kind in behavior
and constant in love
As firm in affection
as the Turtle-Dove,
Valiant in action
in every degree
There Is none but a Seaman, etc,
The Seamen adventures
their lives at the Seas
Whilst land men on shore
takes pleasure and ease
The Seamen at all times
their business must ply
In Winter and Summer
in wet and in dry
From toil and pains taking
they seldom are free
There Is none but a Seaman, etc,
Moreover I Would have you
for to understand
That Seamen brings treasure
and profit to land
Above and beneath ground
for wealth they have sought
And when they have found it
to England it is brought
With hazard of lives
by experience we see
There Is none but a Seaman, etc.
Seamen from beyond Seas
bring silver and gold
With Pearls and rich Jewels
most rare to behold
With Silks and rich Velvets
their credits to save
Or else you gay Ladies
could not go so brave
This makes my heart merry
as merry may be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
The second Part
to the same Tune,


THe Seamen brings Spices
and Sugar so fine
Which serve the brave gallants
to drink with their wine
With Lemonds and Orenges
all of the best
To relish their pallats
when they make a feast
Sweet Figs, Prunes and Raisons
by them brought home be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
To comfort poor people,
the Seamen do strive
And brings in maintenance
to keep them alive
As raw silk and cotton wool
to card and to spin
And so by their labors
their livings comes in
Most men are beholding
to Seamen we see
With none but a Seaman
I married will be.
The Mercer's beholding
we know well enough
For Holland, Lawn, Cambrick,
and other gay stuff
That Is brought from beyond seas
by Seamen so bold,
The rarest that ever
men's eyes did behold
God prosper the Seamen
where ever they be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
The Merchants themselves
are beholding also
To honest Seamen
that on purpose do go
To bring them home profit
from other strange lands,
Or else their fine daughters
must work with their hands
The Nobles and Gentry
of every degree
Are also beholding
to Seamen we see.
Thus for rich men and poor men,
the Seamen does good
And sometimes comes off with
loss of much blood
If they were not a guard
and defense for our land
Our enemiee soon would get
the upper hand
And then in a woeful case
strait we should be
There Is none but a Seaman
shall marry with me.
To draw to conclusion
and so make an end
I hope that great Neptune
my love will befriend
And send him home safely
with health and with life
Then shall I with joyfulness
soon be his wife
You maids wives, and widows
that Sea-mens loves be
With hearts and with voices
Join Prayers with me.
God bless all brave Sea men
from quicksands and rocks
From loss of their blood
and from enemies knocks
From lightning and thunder.
and tempests so strong
From ship wrack and drowning
and all other wrong
And they that to these words
will not say, Amen.
It Is pity that they should ever
speak words again.
