The praise of Saylors here set forth, With the hard Fortunes which do befall
them on the Seas, when Landmen sheep safe on their beds.
To a pleasant new tune.


AS I lay musing in my bed,
full warm and well at ease,
I thought upon the lodgings hard
poor Saylors had at Seas.
They hide it out with hunder and cold
and many a bitter blast,
And many times constraind they are
for to cut down their Mast,
Their Victuals and their Ordinance
and ought else that they have,
They throw it over board with speed,
and seek their lives to save,
When as the raging Seas do foam,
and lofty winds do blow,
The Saylors they go to the top,
when Land-men stay below.
Our Masters Mate takes helm in hand
his course he steers full well.
When as the lofty winds do blow
and raging Seas do swell.
Our Master to his Compass goes,
so well he plyes his charge,
He sends a Youth unto them amain
for to unsling the Yard.
The Boatson he is under the Deck,
a man of courage bold,
To' th top, to' th top my lively Lads,
hold fast my hearts of gold.
The Pylot he stands on the Clain
with a Line and a Lead so sound
To see how far and near they are
from any dangerous ground,
It is a testimonial good,
we are not far from Land,
There sits a Mermaid on the Rock
with comb and glass in hand.
Our Captain he is on the poop
a man of might and power.
And look when raging Seas do gaps
our bodies to devour.
Our Royal ship to run to rack,
that was so stout and trim,
And some are put unto their shifts
either to sink or swim.


Our ship that was before so good,
and eke likewise so trim,
Is now with raging Seas grown leakt
and water fast comes in.
The Quartermaster is a man,
so well his charge plyes he,
He calls them to the Pomp a main
to keep their leakt ship free.
And many dangers likewise they
do many times endure,
When as they meet their enemies
that come with might and power
And seek their lives likewise to take
their lives and eke their goods,
Thus Saylors they sometimes endure
upon the surging floods.
But when as they do come to Land,
and homewards safe return.
They are most good fellows all,
and scorn ever to mourn.
And likewise they will call for wine,
and score it on the post.
For Saylors they are honest men
and love to pay their Oast.
For Saylors they be honest men
and they do take great pains,
When Landed men and ruffling Lads
do rob them of their grains.
Our Saylors they work night and day
their mand-hood for to try.
When Landed men and ruffling Jacks
do in their Cabins lie.
Therefore let all good minded men,
give ear unto my Song,
And say also as well as I
Saylors deserve no wrong,
Thus have I done for Saylors sake
in token of good will,
It ever I can do them good,
I will be ready still,
God bless them eke by Sea and Land
and also other men,
And as my Song beginning had
so must it have an end,
