The Hangman he your guide must be, for thither go you must.
To a pleasant new Tune, Come back my own sweet Duck.


OLd England now rejoice,

Tryu^ph with heart and voice.

This is good news indeed

(...) Charles must wear his Crown
You that did once bare sway
and kept us all at under,
Now is your reckoning day;

Those that did firmly stand

You banished the Land,
and chaste them up and down,;
Then Traitors all repent,
in City and in town,
Your time is almost spent,

What answer can you make
either to God or man,
What course now can you take

For murdering of your King,

The second Part,

YOur Anabaptists head

King Charles, etc,
Come Harrison thou art the man.

Alack blind Hewson now,
where is thy Last and Awl,
It had been better for thee

And for killing poor prentice boys
for playing at the foot ball,
Squire Dun has be hempen toys
for sure will serve you all.
Bold Arthur Haslerigge
Newcastle does thee curse
For raising of their Coals
four shillings a Chauldron just;
Nay this is the worst of all,

Repent you traitors all
in City and in town,
Justice does on you call,
King Charles will pull you down.
Your (...) curse the day
that ever you did know
Bold Oliver, I say,
that traitor, Englands foe;
He being a Brewers Son
you liquored well your throat,
the Commenty you have undone
Yet now beware a Rope
for climbing up so high
You are sure to have a fall.
the innocent blood does cry
Down with those Rebels all.
When you had murdered the King
you banished his Wife,
And all he Royal Offspring
you fought to take their life;
All that true Subjects were
you bid them traitors call.
You must to Hide-Park-Fair,
Squire Dun invites you all.
then traitors all look to it.
the Rump cannot you save,
the Gallows will claim her due
use all the skill you have.
Concluding thus I cry
God save our gracious King
From bloody tyranny,
and all the royal Offspring,
Lord bless the Duke of York,
brave General Monck also,
He is a Noble Spark
against King Charles his so.
then traitors all repent,
mark we well what here is said,
Your time is almost spent
alack you are all betrayed,
T. R.

FINIS.
