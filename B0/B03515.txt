Great News from Guild Hall: Being an ACCOUNT of Two Trials on Tuesday.
The One of an Eminent Shoemaker in the City, Who, for Lascivious Violence
offered to his Maid, was Fined Six Pounds.
The Other of a Gentleman, who gave Love-Powder to his Man- and Maid-Sservant;
for which he was also Fined One Hundred and Fifty Pounds.
To the Tune of, The Guinea Wins her.
I.
DRaw near to hear this Ditty,
that I shall lay before You,
Committed in the City;
and it is true I do assure You.
Come all ye Cobblers great and small,
And Shoemakers that use the Peggin-Aul;
Come all, and hear me Prate,
just now I shall relate
one of your Brother Trade,
Did serve his Serving Maid,
near Birching Lane, it is said,
He dwelt, that did his Serving-maid assault
II.
He took her by her Hand Sir,
and furiously did Kiss Her;
But the Jade she would not stand Sir,
although he did embrace her:
Then up her Coats his Hand he thrust,
Like a Dog at Bear, he held it fast:
I need not tell you what,
for you may guess at that,
but as some People say,
Six Hairs he hawld away,
for which he is forced to pay
Six Pound, the dearest Hairs that ere was found
III.
Her Master she did Summon,
at Guild Hall to appear Sir,
Where the Trial it was Common,
for any one to hear Sir,
Her Master, being guilty found,
Eor the Fact alas! was fined Six Pound:
for he could not deny't,
but that he took her by it,
which cost him very dear,
a pound for every Hair,
could she but vend her Ware
So well, she might buy the Devil out of Hell
IV.
Now the Trial it is ended,
and the Pulling Jobb is over;
The Shoemaker was befriended
we plainly may discover;
For to his Shame it may rebound,
That he for ev^ry Hair should pay a Pound
for yet they are not so dainty,
one Shilling will buy Twenty:
you Gallants give good Ear,
and do not steal a Hair,
lest that you pay severe,
For one, may unto twenty Shillings come.
The Second Part.
Being an Account of a Gentleman, who gave Love-Powder to his Man- and
Maidservant, etc.
I.
THE Eleventh Day of June, Sir
there happened such an other;
But of a different tune Sir,
more unhappy than the other:
Which likewise was at Guild Hall tried,
And heavy fell upon the Masters side;
for to his Man and Maid,
to make 'em Love it is said,
Cantary he did give,
a Powder to breed Love:
and this he did contrive.
That he might a reputed Arrest
II.
He gave 'em both Cantary,
to create a mighty Vigor:
But he found it quite contrary,
it did operate with Rigor.
That which should made 'em both have loved,
A dire Bane to them had well nigh proved.
for sick they were indeed,
so sick they kept their Bed,
their Veins it did infect,
that few did Life expect:
and for this impious Fact,
His Fine, is reckoned Sevenscore Pounds and Tenn.
III.
Now I give it as a Caution
to you, for the future,
You make use of no such Potion,
lest your Case should be no better*
For many Tricks I know are done,
With this same Philtre or Loves Potion
but let me tell you this,
it is a saucy Price;
which makes him sadly moan,
to part with so much Coin
for one poor Potion.
Alas! His is a very wretched Case.
