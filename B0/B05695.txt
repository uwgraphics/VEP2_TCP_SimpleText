WILLIAM and MARY by the Grace of God, King and Queen of Great Britain, France
and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith,
To Macers of Our Privy Council, or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriff in that
part conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting;
Forasmuch as, by the third Act of the fourth Session of Our current
Parliament, We with Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parliament, did Impose
and Ordain an Additional Excise of Three pennies upon the Pint of Ale and Beer
browen, and to be vended and sold within this Kingdom, and Two shilling upon
the Pint of Aquavite and Strong Water made of Malt, or otherways as in the
said Act, and did set down and appoint certain Methods and Rules for Levying,
Raising and Uplifting the same, in manner mentioned in the said Act; And with
Advice and Consent foresaid did Authorize and empower the Lords of Our privy
Council, to prescribe such other Methods and Orders as they should judge
necessar, for making the said Act effectual, and We considering the great
hinderance the Tacksmen of Our said Additional Excise meet with in the several
Shires, for uplifting the said Three pennies, and two shilling of Excise
imposed in manner foresaid, by the not meeting of the Commissioners of Supply,
duly and frequently, to determine all differences between the Brewers and
Tacksmen, their Sub-tracksmen and Collectors, and for want of orderly and
rimous Entries by the Brewers, of all Liquors browen by them liable to the said
Excise, wherethrow great Loss and Prejudice does arise to that Branch of the
Supply granted to Us thereby: For Remeed whereof, We with Advice of the Lords
of Our Privy Council, strictly Require and Command, the whole Commissioners of
Supply in all the Shires within this Kingdom, qualified according to Law, and
who by the said Act of Parliament, are appointed Commissioners of the said
Additional Excise, to meet at the Head burghs of their respective Shires, at
the days respective following, viz: These on this side of the River of Tay,
upon the second Tuesday of January next, and these on the other side of the
said River of Tay, upon the Third Tuesday of the said Month, and at their
Meetings to settle and appoint places, such as they shall find most convenient,
where public Excise-offices shall be kept, for the Brewers to enter and give
up the quantities of the Liquors browen by them, liable in payment of the said
Excise; And appoints the said Commissioners Immediately after designing the
places for the said Offices, to cause make public Intimation at all the
Church-doors within the said respective Shires, of the particular Places
designed by them for the several Excise-offices, with Certification to the
said Ccmmissioners, or any of them residing within the said respective
Shires, who shall failie to meet at the said, days respective above set down,
and to appoint and design the particular Places for, Excise-offices in manner
above expressed, they shall be, and are hereby Fined, each of them, in the Sum of
One hundred pounds Scots for the said absence, to be charged for, upon a simple
Charge of six days, and uplifted by the Collectors of Supply of the respective
Shires, for which effect, Letters are hereby Authorized to be directed at the
instance; of the said Collectors against them, and appoints the Clerk to the
said Commissioners, to send a List of such of the said Commissioners as shall
be absent at the said two Dyets, immmediatly after elapsing of these Dyets
duly subscribed by him to the said Collectors under the pain of Deprivation,
and the Collectors are to be comptable for the said Fines to the Justices of
Peace in the several Shires, to be applied by them for the repairing of Bridges
and Highways within their respective Bounds, as they shall see cause: And We
with Advice foresaid, Require and Command, the said Commissioners to subdivide
themselves, so as there may be at least two (who are hereby declared to be a
Quorum) to meet and be present at each Office, upon the days respective
following; viz these upon this side of Tay upon the third Tuesday of the said
Month of January next, and these upon the other side of the said River the
fourth Tuesday of the said Month for the first Diet: And We with Advice
foresaid, Require and Command the whole Brewers within the bounds alloted for
the said respective Offices, to attend and wait upon the said respective
Commissioners at the offices particularly to be appointed by them upon the days
above expressed, without any farther Intimation, Charge or Citation to be given
to them by the said Tacksmen Subtacksmen or Collectors of the said Additional
Excise, but the publication hereof allenarly in manner after-mentioned, and
there to give in and make, and the Commissioners to receive from them faithful
and full Entries of all Liquors browen within the said Bounds liable in
payment of the said Additional Excise for the Months of June, July, August,
September, October and November last and December current; And because the
Brewers for want of timous Intimation for the said Months of June, July and
August, may pretend that they cannot give their Oaths, if required upon the
precise quantity of their brewing the said Months; They are therefore hereby
allowed to give their Oaths in these Terms, that their said brewing has not
exceeded such a quantity, which is hereby held as sufficient to make them
liable for the same, And sicklike that the said Commissioners meet, and the
said Brewers attend them at the said respective Offices, without any further
Intimation, Charge or Citation, but what is above expressed the first Tuesday of
every Month, during the continuance of the said Additional Excise, for making
and receiving in the Entries of all Liquor browen within the said Bounds liable
to the said Excise for the preceding Month, and to judge in all Matters
relating either to the said Additional Excise, or to the Excise imposed
formerly upon Malt, and annexed to our Crown, betwixt the Brewers and our
Tacksmen, their Sub-Tacksmen and Collectors, with Certfication to such of the
said Brewers, who shall not compear and attend the said Dyets respective
abovementioned, they shall be holden as Confessed, and Decreets given against
them for the quantities of Liquor liable to the foresaid Additional Excise,
which shall be contained in the Claims or Complaints to be given in by the
Tacksmen, Sub-Tacksmen and Collectors against them; and that at the first:
Meeting upon the subsequent Month, after the respective Brewers their absence
and failie, to make a due Entry upon the first Tuesday of the preceding Month.
And in case the Ent^ of any Brewer shall be disproven, then they shall be
liable in payment of such a Fine, as the Commissioners, or other Judges after
named shall Impose, not exceeding the Double of what Liquor shall be concealed;
and all Execution competent, shall be made use of by our Tacksmen, their
Sub-Tacksmen or Collectors, against the respective Brewers for the same. And in
case the said Commissioners, or at least two of them, shall fail to meet and
attend the said respective Officer the said third and fourth Tuesdays
respective of January next, or upon the first Tuesday of any subsequent Month,
during the continuance of the said Additional Excise, the whole division, and
each of them, shall be liable in the Fine of twenty Pound Scots a piece toties
quoties, to be uplifted and applied, in manner as the other Fynes above
mentioned. And after Instruments taken against them of their failie to meet and
attend as said is; We, with Advice foresaid, require and command the Sheriffs
and their Deputes, or such as the said Sheriffs shall substitute at each
particular Dyety for effect allenarly, to repair to the said respective
Offices, within twenty four Hours after they shall be desired by the Tacksmen,
either of Annexed or Additional Excise, their Sub Tacksmen or Collectors, there
summarly, to judge on what occurs within the Bounds of that Office, in
reference to the said Annexed or Additional Excise, certifying the said
