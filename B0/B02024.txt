WHEREAS diverse Officers, Gunners, Armourers, Gunsmiths, Carpenter,
Wheele-wrights and other Arti^icers (...) in Our service, and entertained in
several conditions and employments in Our Office of the Ordinance, and for the
use of Our Train of Artillery, have contrary to their duties, not only absented
themselves from Our service, and their several employments therein, but many
of them contrary to their Allegiance have put themselves under and Entertained
themselves with those now in actual Rebellion against Us, and thereby have
fallen into the heinous Crime of high Treason against Us, Our Crown and
Dignity, Notwithstanding which; out of Our tender Compassion, We desiring by
all fair and merciful ways and means to reduce Our Subjects to their duty
and obedience, are graciously pleased, and do hereby offer Our free and
gracious pardon, to all Officers, Gunners, Armourers, Wheele-wrights,
Carpenters, and all other Artificers and Ministers of, and belonging to Our
Office of the Ordinance, who shall within ten days after the publication
hereof, leave the service of the Rebels, and return to their allegiance to
Us, and repair to their service in Our Army, in the said Office of the
Ordinance; And We do hereby farther publish and declare, That if any officer
or officers above mentioned, either in service against Us, or such who absents
themselves, and thereby neglect their duties, shall continue therein, and not
give their Personal attendance upon Us at Our City of Oxford, in the said
office, before the Eighteenth day of this instant March, they shall not only
loose all Wages, Fees, and other Allowances due unto them by their offices and
places, but be put sorth, and excluded Our service, and other persons settled in
the same, and such farther punishments be inflicted on them, so refusing Our
Grace, or disobeying Our Commands, as the greatness of their Crimes shall
deserve, of which We intend to take a speedy, and straight account.

Given at Our Court at OXFORD, this seventh of March, in the Eighteenth year
of Our Reign.
