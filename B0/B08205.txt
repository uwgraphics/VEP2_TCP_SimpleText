Because I am a sinner.

man.

Could there no other mean, nor person be found in Heaven or Earth, to save
you, but the son of God must do (...)*

No verily.

Must he needs be God and man?

Yea.

Why?

First, because he must die for us, and God Heb. 9. 22.
cannot die, therefore he must be man.

Secondly, he must overcome death, which Heb. 2. 14.
being onley man, he could not, therefore he must also be God.

How did he save you?

As he was man 1. Pet. 1. 1^. and 2. 22. Heb. 4. 1^.
perfectly righteous, he performed the perfect obedience of the law, and
satisfied the 1 Pet. 2. 24. and 4. 1. 1. Pet. 3. 18.
justice of God for me. And as he was God, he overcame death, and raised up
his body the third day.

Only such as truly believe.

What is faith?

Faith, is Heb. 10. 22. Romans 4. 20. 21.
a full assurance of John. 1. 12.
my salvation in Jesus Christ Act. 4. 12.
alone.

Has every man this faith in himself?

No, for it is the 2. These. 3. 2. Phil. 1. 29.
gift of God, and not of Mat. 16. 17.
nature.

How is faith gotten?

By the outward hearing of the word of Romans 10. 17. 2. Cor. 1. 21. Acts. 2.
41. 2. Cor. 4. 1^. Acts. 16. ^^ John. 8. 31. and 6. 17. 1. Pet. 2. 2.
God preached, and the inward working of the Spirit.

How is it strengthened and increased in you?

By the same preaching of the word, and the use of the Sacraments* and prayer.

How shall a man know whether he have this true and saving faith, or no?

By the fruits and marks thereof.

What be the fruits of faith?

A hatred of all sin, a continual care to Act^. 2. 37. Heb. 11. 7. Psalm.
119. 113. ^. John. 314.
please God in the duties commanded, an vn^ained love to Gods word and to his
people.

Rehearse the sum of your Faith?

I believe in God the Father, etc.

How many parts be there of this Creed?

Two.

Which be they?

The first is of GOD, the second is of the Church.

Let us now come to the means of strengthening our faith, as of the Sacraments
and prayer: and first what is a Sacrament? Romans 4. 11.


A Sacrament is a seal and pledge of those benefits of my salvation, which I
receive by Christ.

How many Sacraments be there in the Church of God?

Two. Mat. ^8. 1^. and 26. 26.


Which be they?

Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord. 1. Cor. 11. 23.


Who ordained them? Mat. 26. 26. 1. Cor. 1^* (...).


The Lord Jesus.

To what end?

To strengthen our faith, and to further our repentance.

How many things are to be considered in a Sacrament?

Two.

Which be they? Genesis 17. 11. Romans 4. 11.


The sign, and the thing signified.

In Baptism, which is the sign that may be seen? Acts. 8. 26.


Water.

What is the thing signified? John. 3. ^.


The washing away of my sins by the blood of Christ.

How is your Faith strongthened by Baptism?

By Baptism I am received into the family Mark. 16. 16.
and congregation of the Lord* and am thereby fully assured, that both my
sins Act. 2. 3^.
are forgiven me, and the punishment due to the same.

What do you profess in Baptism?

To die unto sin, and to live unto righteousness. Romans ^. ^.


In the Supper of the Lord, which be the Signs that may be seen?

Bread and Wine. Mat. 26. 26. 27. 1. Co^. 11. 23. 24. (...).


What do they signify?

The body and blood of Christ.

How is your Faith strengthened by the Supper of the Lord?

By the Supper of the Lord my Faith is strengthened, that as I receive the
bread and wine into my body to become mine: so does my soul receive withal
Jesus Christ* with all the benefits of his death to be wholly mine.

Is the bread and wine turned into the natural body and blood of Christ,
flesh, blood, and bone?

No, the bread and wine of their own nature are not changed, but in use they
differ from other common bread and wine, because they be appointed of God to
be signs of the body and blood of Christ.

Why then does Christ say* This is my body?

It is a figurative speech usual in the Scripture, as circumcision is called
the covenant, Genesis 10. 10. 11 Exodus 12. 11.
the Lamb is called the passover: and yet it is not the covenant, nor the
passover, but a sign of it.

How do you eat Christ's body, and drink his blood?

Spiritually, and by Faith. John. 6. 63.


Are all persons without exception to be admitted to the Supper of the Lord?

No.

Who are not to be admitted?

Children, Fools, Madmen, Ignorant persons, 1. Cor. 11. 2^. Tit. 3. 10.
known heretics, open and notorious sinners not repenting.

What must he do that will (...) worthily to the supper of the Lord?

He must prove and examine himself. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 29.


Wherein must he examine himself?

First, what knowledge he has in the principles of Religion, and especially in
the matter of the Sacrament.

Secondly, whether he has true ^aith in Jesus Christ, or no.

Thirdly, whether he be penitent and ^^rie for his sins past, purposing to
leave them, Mat. ^. 23. Romans 12. 18. Heb. 12. 14.
and to live godly, endeavoring himself to be in brotherly love and charity
with all men.

Then it seems there be some, ^h^ (...) they come, yet they loose the
benefit of this communion in themselves?

Yea.

Who be they?

Such as come not in Faith, and are not grieved for their sins past, as
hypocrites, civil men, Church Papists, privy enemies to Gods word, and so
many of the godly as 1. Cor. 11. 30. 2. Chro. 30. 18
come not sufficiently prepared, procure a punishment.

What is the other help you have to increase Faith?

Prayer.

What is prayer?

Prayer, is a spiritual action of Faith wherein (...). 8. 26. ^am. 1. 6. ^.
John. 5. 14.
we require of God in the name of Christ, all things necessary, his glory and
our comfort.

To whom must you Pray?

To God only.

In whose name? Psalm. ^0. 14. 15*


In the name of Christ.

Then you may not pray to Saints, or Angels, John. 16. ^3.
or to God in the name of a Saint or Angel?

No.

Wh^^?

Because there is neither commandment, promise, nor example in the Scripture
for it.

How must you pray?

As Christ has taught me, saying: Mat. 6. ^.


Our Father which art, etc.

How many petitions be there in this prayer?

Six, three concerning the glory of God, and three our own necessities.

What are these words, Our Father which are in heaven?

A preface or introduction to the prayer.

What are these words: For thine is the kingdom, the power and glory for
ever?

The conclusion of the prayer.

What do you owe to God for all his benefits?

Thanksgiving. Psalm. 1^6. 12. ^3.


Is it enough that you thank him with your ^lips alone? Ephesians. ^. 10. Deuteronomy. 8.
3. 6. (...).


No, but I must be obedient to his laws and commandments: which grace the
Lord grant.

Amen.
