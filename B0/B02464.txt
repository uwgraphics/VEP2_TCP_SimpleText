The KINGS Bench Prisoners Thanks To His Majesty, for their Late Deliverance By
His Majesty's Most Gracious Act.
GReat and Dread Sir Late Prisoners Write to show,
That you have made us Debtors, now we owe
Far more then ever, since you did us free
As Israelites from Aegypts Cruelty.
This is a Debt, which we can never pay,
Unless your Majesty find out some way,
Wherein our service may our thanks explain,
Willing to dye for such a Sovereign:
This Act surpasses Alexanders plause,
Your Scepter swaying the too rigid Laws,
Ingratitude is base in every sense,
Our lives or fortunes cannot recompense
This most Heroic Act in setting free
Distressed Subjects from Calamity.
Worthy of note you free us first, and then
By gratitude you fix us fast again.
Like to the Bird's penned up within a Cage,
Just so were we closed in an Iron Age;
Till your most Gracious Key unlocked the door
Commanding that which was denied before.
Almost incredible without a fee;
This was a Type of Sacred Dignity.
Sure we can never forget so good a King,
Like Sapho's Bird, your praise we will always sing.
And thus conclude; wishing our hope prevails,
God send succession in a Prince of Wales.
By William Cragmile.
