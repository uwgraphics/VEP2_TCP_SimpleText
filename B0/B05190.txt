Edinburgh, the Twenty third Day of March, 1689.
THE Meeting of the Estates taking to their Consideration, That several Persons
have been seen in Arms coming from England, or going to, or coming from
Ireland; And the Danger that may thereby arise to the Peace of the Nation in
this Iuncture, Do therefore Authorize and Require, all Sheriffs, Stewards,
Baillies of Bailliaxies and Regalities, and their Deputs, Magistrates of Burghs,
Justices of the Peace, and Officers of the Militia throughout the Kingdom, to
Observe and take Care of the Highways, Ports, Ferries, and other Passes and
Places of Resort, within their respective Bounds, and to Seize and Secure any
suspected Persons who shall be found in Arms, and can gibe no reasonable
Account of themselves and their Affairs, to the said Magistrates or Officers;
and Ordains the Collectors of Customs, and Waiters at the respective Ports and
Ferries, to give timeous notice, and delate such Persons to the said
respective Magistrates and Officers for that effect; And for the Encouragement
of the said Magistrates and Officers, The Estates Declare, that where any such
Persons in Arms are apprehended, and can give no reasonable account of
themselves and their Affairs, the respective Magistrates and Officers of
Militia, who shall happen to apprehend them, shall after they are Tried, and
Convicted of any evil Design against the Public Peace, have the Horses and
Arms of such Persons for their Reward. And Ordains these Presents to be
Intimate at the Mercat-Crosses of the Head-Burghs of the several Shires of the
Kingdom, that none pretend Ignorance. Extracted out of the Records of the
Meeting of the Estates by me
