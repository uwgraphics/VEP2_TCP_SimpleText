Robin Hood newly revived.
To a Delightful New TUNE.


COme listen a while you Gentlemen all,
with a hey down down a down down,
That are in this Bower within,
for a story of gallant bold Robin Hood
I purpose now to begin.
What time of the day, quoth. Robin Hood then,
with a hey down, etc.
Quoth little John, it is in the prime,
why then we will to the green wood gang,
For we have no victuals to dine.
As Robin Hood walked the forest along,
with a hey down, etc.
It was in the midst of the day,
there was he met with a deft young man,
As ever walked on the way.
His Doublet was of silk, he said
with a hey down, etc.
His stockings like scarlet shone,
and he walked on along the way
To Robin Hood then unknown.
A herd of Deer was in the Bend,
with a hey down, etc.
All feeding before his face,
now the best of ye i will have to my dinner,
And that in a little space.
Now the stranger he made no mickle ado
with a hey down, etc.
But he bends a right good Bow,
and the best Buck in the Herd he flew,
Forty good yards him fr^.
Well shot, well shot, quoth. Robin Hood then,
with a hey down, etc.
That shot it was shot in time,
and if thou will accept of the place,
Thou shall be a bold Yeoman of mine.
Go play the Chiven, the stranger said,
with a hey down, etc.
Make haste and quickly go,
or with my fist besure of this,
I Will give thee buffets store.
Thou had not best buffet me, said To. Hood,
with a hey down, etc.
For though I seem forlorn,
yet I can have those that will take my part
If I blow but my horn.
Thou wast not best wind thy horn, the stranger said.
with a hey down, etc.
Be'est thou never so much in haste,
for I can draw out a good broad sword
And quickly cut the blast.
Then Robin Hood bent a very good bow,
with a hey down, etc.
To that shot and he would fain,
the stronger he bent up a noble bow
To shoot at bold Robin again.
O hold thy hand, hold thy hand, quoth. To. Hood,
with a hey down, etc.
To shoot it would be in vain,
for if we should shoot the one at the other,
The one of us must be slain.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
But let us take our swords and our ^ro^d ^u^klers,
with a hey down etc.
And gang under yonder tree;
as I ho^e to be sa^'d (the stranger said)
One foot I will not flee.
Then Robin Hood lent the stranger a blow
with a hey down, etc.
Most scared him out of his wit;
thou never felt blow (the stranger said)
That shall be better quit.
The stranger he drew our a good broad sword,
with a hey down, etc.
And hit Robin on the crown,
that from every hair of bold Robins head
The blood ran trickling down.
God-a-merry good fellow (quoth. To. Hood then)
with a hey down, etc.
And for this that thou have done,
tell me good fellow what thou art,
Tell me where thou do won.
The stranger then answered bold To. Hood,
with a hey down, etc.
I Will tell thee where I did dwell;
in Maxfield was I born and bred,
My name is young Gamwel.
For killing of my fathers Steward,
with a hey down, etc.
I am forced to this English Wood,
and for to seek an Uncle of mine,
Some call him Robin Hood.
But art thou a Cousen of Robin Hoods then?
with a hey down, etc.
The soone^ we should have done,
as I hope to be saved (the stranger then said
I am his own sisters son.
But Lord what kissing and courting was there
with a hey down, etc.
When these two Couzens did meet,
and they went all that summers day
And little John did meet.
But when they met with little John,
with a hey down, etc.
He thereunto did say:
O Master where have you been
You have tarried so long away?
I met with a stranger (quoth. Robin Hood then)
with a hey down, etc.
Full sore he has beaten me;
then i will have about with him (quoth. little John)
And try if he can beat me.
Oh no, Oh no (quoth Robin Hood)
with a hey down, etc.
Little John it may not be so,
for he is my own dear sisters son,
And Couzens I have no mo.
But he shall be a hold Yeoman of mine,
with a hey down, etc.
My chief Man next to thee,
and I Robin Hood, and thou little John,
And Scarlet he shall be.
And we'll be three of the bravest Outlaws
with a hey down, etc.
That is in the North-Country.
if you will have any more of bold Robin Hood,
In this second Part it will be.
Then bold To. Hood to the North he would go,
with a hey down, etc.
With valor and mickle might,
with sword by his side which often had bin tried
To fight and recover his right.
The first that he met with was a bold Scot,
with a hey down, etc.
His servant he said he would be;
no, quoth. Robin Hood, it cannot be good,
For thou will prove false unto me.
Thou have not been true to Sire nor Cuz,
with a hey down, etc.
Nay, marry, the Scot he said,
as true as your heart i will never part,
Good Master be not afraid.
Then Robin Hood turned his face to the East,
with a hey down, etc.
Fight on my merry men stour,
our case is good quoth brave Robin Hood,
And we shall not be beaten our.
The Battle grows hot on every side,
with a hey down, etc.
The Scotch-man made great moan,
quoth Jockey good says they fight on each side
Would I were with my Wife Joan.
The Enemy compast brave Robin about,
with a hey down, etc.
It Is long e're the battle ends,
there is neither will yield, nor give up the field
For both are supplied with friends.
This song it was made in Robin Hoods days,
with a hey down down a down down,
Let Us pray unto Jove above,
to give us true peace, that mischief may cease,
And war may give place unto love.
Printed for Alex. Milbourn at the Stationers-Arms in Green-Arbor-Court in the
Little Old Bailey.
