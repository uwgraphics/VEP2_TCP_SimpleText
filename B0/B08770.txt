TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. The humble Petition of the Commissioners
of the general Assembly of the Kirk of SCOTLAND, met at Edenborough, Ian. 4.
1643.
Our silence and ceasing to present before your Majesty our humble thoughts and
desires at this time of common danger to Religion, to your Majesty's sacred
person, your Crown and Posterity, and to all your Majesty's Dominions, were
impiety against God, unthankefulnesse and disloyalty against your Majesty, and
indirect approbation and hardening of the Adversaries of truth and peace in
their wicked ways, and cruelty against our brethren, lying in such depths of
affliction and anguish of spirit. Any one of which crimes were in us, above all
others, unexcusable, and would prove us most unworthy of the trust committed
unto us. The flame of this common combustion has almost devoured Ireland, is
now wasting the Kingdom of England, and we cannot tell how soon it shall enter
upon our selves and set this your Majesty's most ancient and native Kingdom on
fire: If in this woeful case and lamentable condition of your Majesty's
Dominions al others should be silent, it behooves us to speak; and if our
Tongues and Penns should cease, our Consciences within us would cry out, and
the stones in the streets would answer us.

Our great grief and apprehension of danger is not a little increased, partly
by the insolency and presumption of Papists and others disaffected to the
Reformation of Religion; who although for their number and power they be not
considerable amongst us, yet through the success of the Popish party in
Ireland, and the hopes they conceive of the prevailing power of Popish Armies,
and the Prelaticall Faction in England, they have of late taken spirit, and
begun to speak big words against the Reformation of Religion, and the work of
God in this Land; and partly, and more principally, that a chief praise of the
Prot^ant Religion (and thereby our not vain, but just gloriation) is by the
public Declaration of the Earl of Newcastle, General of Your Majesty's
Forces for the Northern parts, and nearest unto us, transferred unto Papists.
Who although they be sworn Enemies unto Kings, and be as infamous for their
treasons and Conspiracies against Princes and Rulers, as for their known
Idolatry and spiritual Tyranny; yet are they openly declared to be not only
good Subjects, or better Subjects, but far better Subjects then Protestants,
which is a new and foul disparagement of the reformed Religion, a notable
injury to your Majesty in your honor, a sensible reflection upon the whole body
of this Kingdom, which is impatient that any subjects should be more loyal
then they; but abhors and extremely disdaineth that Papists who refuse to
take the Oath of Allegiance, should be compared with them in allegiance and
fidelity, and (which being a strange Doctrine from the mouth or pen of
professed Protestants) will suffer a hard construction from al thereformed Kirks.

We therefore Your Majesty's most humble and loving Subjects, upon these and
the like considerations, do humbly entreat, that Your Majesty may be pleased
in Your Princely wisdom, First to consider, that the intentions of Papists
directed by the principles of their Profession are no other then they have
been from the beginning, even to build their Babell, and to set up their
execrable Idolatry and Antichristian Tyranny in all Your Majesty's Dominions,
to change the face of your two Kingdoms of Scotland and England into the
similitude of miserable Ireland: which is more bitter to the People of God,
your Majesty's good Subjects to think upon, then death: and whatsoever their
present pretenses be for the desence of Your Majesty's Person, and Authority;
yet in the end by their Arms and Power, with a displayed Banner, to bring that
to pass against Your Royal Person and Posterity, which the fifth of November
(never to be forgotten) was not able by their subtle and undermining treason
to produce; or which will be their greatest mercy, to reduce Your Majesty and
Your Kingdoms to the base and unnatural slavery of their Monarch the Pope.

And next, that Your Majesty upon this undeniable evidence, may timously, and
speedily apply your Royal Authority for disbanding their Forces, suppressing
their power, and disappointing their bloody and merciless projects.

And for this end we are with greater earnestness then before constrained, to
fall down again before your Majesty, and in all humility to renew the
supplication of the late general Assembly, and our own former Petition in
their name, for unity of Religion, and for uniformity of Church government, in
all your Majesty's Kingdoms, and to this effect for a meeting of some Divines
to be holden in England; unto which according to the desire of your Majesty's
Parliament some Commissioners may be sent from this Kirk, that in all points
to be proponed and debated, there may be the greater consent and harmony. We
take the boldness to be the more instant in this our humble desire, because it
concerns the Lord Jesus Christ so much in his glory, your Majesty in your
Honor, the Kirk of England (which we ought to tender as our own bowels,
and whose reformation is more dear unto us, then our lives) in her happiness,
and the Kirk of Scotland in her purity and peace; former experience, and daily
sense teaching us, that without the reformation of the Kirk of England, there
is no hope or possibility of the continuance of reformation here.

The Lord of Heaven and Earth, whose Vicegerent Your Majesty is, calls for
this great work of Reformation at Your hands, and the present commotions and
troubles of your Majesty's Dominions, are either preparation in the mercy of
God for this blessed reformation and Unity of Religion (which is the desire,
prayer, and expectation of all Your Majesty's good Subjects in this Kingdom) or
which they tremble to think upon, and earnestly deprecate, are in the Justice
of God for the abuse of the Gospel, the tolerating of Idolatry, and
superstition against so clear a light, and not acknowledging the day of
visitation, the beginning of such a doleful desolation, as no policy or power
of man shall be able to prevent, and as shall make Your Majesty's Kingdoms
within a short time as miserable, as they may be happy by a reformation of
Religion. God forbid, that whilst the Houses of Parliament do profess their
desire of the reformation of religion, in a peaceable and Parliamentary way,
and pass their Bills for that end in the particulars, that Your Majesty, the
Nurse-Father of the Kirk of Christ, to whose care the custody and vindication
of religion does principally belong, shall, to the provoking of the anger of
God, the stopping of the influence of so many blessings from Heaven, and the
grieving of the hearts of all the godly, frustrate our expectation, make our
hopes ashamed, and hazard the loss of the hearts of all Your good Subjects,
which next unto the truth and unity of religion, and the safety of Your
Kingdoms, are willing to hazard their lives, and spend their blood for Your
Majesty's Honor, and Happiness.

We are not ignorant that the work is great, the difficulties and impediments
many, and that there be both Mountains and Lions in the way: the strongest
le^, till it be taken out of the way, is the Mountain of Prelacy, and no
wonder if Your Majesty consider how many Papists, and Popishly affected, have
for a long time found Peace and ease under the shadow thereof, how many of the
Prelaticall Faction have thereby their life and being; how many profane and
wordly men do fear the yoke of Christ? and are unwilling to submit
themselves to the obedience of the Gospel? and how many there be whose eyes
are dazzled with the external pomp and glory of the Kirk, whose minds are
miscarried with a conceit of the governing of the Kirk by the rules of humane
policy, and whose hearts are affrighted with the apprehensions of the dangerous
consequences which may ensue upon alterations. But when Your Majesty in Your
Princely and Religious Wisdom, shall remember from the Records of former
times, how against the gates of Hell, the force and fraud of worldly and
wicked men, and all Panicke fears of danger, the Christian Religion was first
planted, and the Christian Kirk thereafter reformed; and from the condition of
the present times, how many from the experience of the tyranny of Prelates are
afraid to discover themselves, lest they be revenged upon them hereafter?
whereas Prelacy being removed they would openly profess what they are, and
join with others in the way of Reformation. All obstacles and difficulties
shall be but matter of the manifestation of the power of God, the principal
worker; and the means of the greater glory to Your Majesty the prime
instrument.

The intermixture of the Government of Prelates, with the civil state,
mentioned in Your Majesty's Answer to our former Petition, being taken away,
and the right government by Assemblies, which is to be seen in all the
reformed Kirkes, and wherein the agreement will be easy, being settled; the
Kirk and Religion will be more pure and free of mixture, and the civil
Government more sound and firm; that government of the kirk must suit best
with the civil state, and be most useful for Kings and Kingdoms, which is
best warranted by God, by whom Kings do reign, and Kindomes are established:
Nor can a reformation be expected in the common and ordinary way, expessed also
in Your Majesty's Answer; the wisest and most religious Princes have found it
impossible, and implying a repugnancy, since the Persons to be reformed, and
the reformers must be diverse, and the way of reformation must be different from
the corrupt way, by which defection of workmen, and corruption in Doctrine,
worship, and government, have entered into the Kirk. Suffer us therefore, dread
Sovereign, to renew our Petitions for this unity of religion, and uniformity
of Kirk government, and for a meeting of some Divines of both Kingdoms who
may prepare matters for Your Majesty's view, and for the examination and
approbation of more full assemblies; The National assembly of this Kirk, from
which we have our Commission, did promise in their thnkesgiving, for the many
favors expressed in Your Majesty's Letter, their best endeavor to keep the
people under their charge in unity and peace, and in Loyalty and obedience to
Your Majesty and Your Laws, which we confess is a duty well beseeming the
Preachers of the Gospel.

But we cannot conceal how much both Pastors and People are grieved and
disquieted, with the late reports of the success, boldness and strength of
Popish forces in Ireland and England, and how much danger from the power of so
malicious and bloody Enemies is apprehended, to the Religion and Peace of this
Kirk and Kingdom, conceived by them to be the spring whence have issued all
their calamities and miseries: Which we humbly remonstrate to Your Majesty as a
necessity requiring a general Assembly, and do earnestly supplicate for the
presence and assistance of Your Majesty's Commissioner at the day to be
appointed, that by universal consent of the whole Kirk, the best course may
be taken for the preservation of Religion, and for the averting of the great
wrath which they conceive to be imminent to this Kingdom. If it shall please
the Lord, in whose hand is the heart of the King, as the rivers of waters, to
turn it whither soever he will, to incline Your Majesty's heart to this
through reformation, no more to tolerate the Mass, or any part of romish
superstition, or tyranny and to command that all good means be used for the
conversion of Your Princely Consort the Queens Majesty (which is also the
humble desire of this whole Kirk and Kingdom) Your Joint comforts shall be
mult^plyed, above the days of Your affliction, to Your incredible joy, Your
glory shall shine in brightness, above all Your royal Progenitors to the
admiration of the world and the terror of Your Enemies, and Your Kingdoms so
far abound in righteousness, Peace and Prosperity, above all that has been
in former Generations, that they shall say, it is good for us that we have
been afflicted.

His Majesty's Answer to a late Petition presented unto Him by the hands of
Alexander Henderson, from the Commissioners of the general Assembly of the
Church of Scotland.
WE received lately a Petition from you, by the hands of Mr. Alexander
Henderson, To the which We intended to have given an answer, as soon as We
had transacted the business with the other Commissioners addressed to us from
the Conservators of the Treaty of that our Kingdom. But finding the same to be
published in Print, and to be dispersed throughout Our Kingdom, to the great
danger of Scandalling of Our well-affected Subjects, who may interpret the
bitterness and sharpness of some Expressions not to be so agreeable to that
regard and Reverence which is due to our Person, and the matter it self to be
reproachful to the honor and constitution of this Kingdom, We have been
compelled the more strictly to examine as well the Authority of the
Petitioners, as the matter of the Petition it self, and to publish Our opinion
of both, that Our Subjects of both Kingdoms may see how equally, just, and
sensible We are of the Laws and Honor of both Our Kingdoms.

And first, upon perusal of the Petition, We required to see the Commission by
which the messenger who brought this Petition, or the persons who sent him, are
qualified to intermedle in Affairs so foreign to their Jurisdiction, and of
so great concernment to this Our Kingdom of England. Upon Examination whereof,
and in defense of the Laws and Government of this Our Kiingdom, which We are
trusted and sworn to defend, We must profess that the Petitioners, or the
general Assembly of Our Church of Scotland have not the least Authority or
Power to intermeddle or interpose in the Affairs of this Kingdom or Church,
which are settled and established by the proper Laws of this Land, and till
they be altered by the same competent power, cannot be enveighed against
without a due sense of Us and this Nation, much less can they present any
advice or Declaration to Our Houses of Parliament against the same, or to that
purpose to send any letters, as they have now done, to any Ministers of Our
Church here, who by the Laws of this Land cannot correspond against the same.
Therefore We do believe that the Petitioners, when they shall consider how
unwarranted it is by the Laws of that Kingdom, and how contrary it is to the
Laws of this, to the professions they have made to each other, and how
becoming in it self for them to require the ancient, happy and established
government of the Church of England to be altered, and conformed to the Laws
and constitutions of another Church will find themselves misled by the
information of some factious persons here, who would willingly engage the
Petitioners to foment a difference and division between the two Kingdoms,
which We have with so much care and industry endeavored to prevent, not having
labored more to quench the combustion in this Kingdom, then We have to hinder
the like from either devouring Ireland, or entering into Scotland, which if all
others will equally labor, will undoubtedly be avoided. But We cannot so
easily pass over the mention of Ireland, being moved to it by scandalous
Aspersions, that have bin often cast upon Us upon that Subject, and the use
that has bin made of the woeful distractions of that Kingdom, as of a
Seminary of fears and jealousies to beget the like distraction in this, and
(which least they may have farther influence) We are the more willing to make
Our Innocence appear in that particular.

When first that horrid Rebellion began, We were in Our Kingdom of Scotland,
and the sense We had then of it, the expressions We made concerning it, the
Commissions (together with some other Assistance) We sent immediately into that
kingdom, and the instant Recommendation We made of it to both Our Houses of
Parliament in England, are known to all persons of quality there and then about
Us. After Our return into England, Our ready concurring to all the desires of
both Houses that might most speedily repress that Rebellion, by passing the
Bill of pressing, and in it a clause which quitted a Right challenged by all,
and enjoyed by many of Our Predecessors, by parting with Our Rights in the
Lands escheated to Us by that Rebellion, for the encouragement of Adventurers,
by emptying of Our Magazines of Arms and Ammunition for that service (which We
have since needed for Our necessary defense and preservation) by consenting to
all Bills for the raising of money for the same, though containing unusual
Clauses, which trusted both Houses without Us with the matter of disposing it,
Our often pressing both Houses, not to neglect that Kingdom, by being diverted
by Considerations and Disputes less concerning both Kingdoms, Our offer of
raising 10000. Volunteers to be sent thither, and our several Offers to
engage Our own Royal Person in the suppression of that horrid rebellion, are
no less known to all this Nation, then Our perpetual earnestness by our
Foreign Ministers to keep all manner of supplies from being transported for
the relief of the Rebels, is known to several neibouring Princes. Which if
all Our Subjects will consider, and withal how many of the men, and how much
of the money raised for that end, and how much Time, Care and Industry have
been diverted from that employment, and employed in this unnatural War against
Us, (the true cause of the present misery and want which Our British Armies
there do now endure) they will soon free Us from al those Imputations so
scandalously and groundlesly laid upon us, and impute the continuance of the
Combustion of that miserable Kingdom, the danger it may bring upon our Kingdoms
of England and Scotland, and the beginning of this doleful desolation, to
those who are truly guilty of it.

For unity in Religion: which is desired, We cannot but answer, That We much
apprehend least the Papist may make some advantage of that expression, by
continuing that scandal with more Authority, which they have ever heretofore
used to cast upon the Reformation, by interpreting all the differences in
Ceremony, Government, or indifferent opinions between several Protestant
Churches, to be differences in Religion; And least our good Subjects of
England, who have ever esteemed themselves of the same Religion with you,
should suspect themselves to be esteemed by you to be of a contrary. And that
the Religion which they and their Ancestors have held ever since the blessed
Reformation, and in and for which they are resolved to dye, is taxed and
branded of Falsehood or Insufficiency, by such a desire.

For uniformity in Church Government, We conceived the Answer formerly given by
Us to the former Petition in this argument, would have s^tisfied the
Petitioners, and is so full, that We can add little to it. viz. That the
Government here established by the laws, has so near a relation and
intermixture with the Civil State (which may be unknown to the Petitioners)
that till a composed disgested form be presented to us, upon a free debate of
both Houses in a Parliamentary way, whereby the consent and approbation of this
whole Kingdom may be had, and We, and all Our Subjects may discern, what is
to be left in, or brought in, as well as what is to be taken away, We know not
how to consent to any alteration, otherwise then to such an Act for the case of
tender Consciences in the matter of Ceremonies, as We have often offered; and
that this, and any thing else that may concern the Peace of the Church, and
the Advancement of Gods true Religion may be soberly discussed, and happily
effected; We have formerly offered, and are still willing that debates of that
nature may be enterd into by a Synod of Godly and Learned Divines to be
regularly chosen according to the Laws and Customs of this Kingdom. To which
We shall be willing that some learned Divines of our Church of Scotland be
likewise sent, to be present, and offer and debate their Reasons. With this
Answer the Petitioners had great reason to acquisce, without enlarging the
matter of their former Petition only with bitter expressions against the
Established Government and Laws of their neighbor Nation, (as if it were
contrary to the word of God) with whom they have so lately entered into a strict
Amity and Friendship.

But We cannot enough wonder, that the Petitioners should interpose themselves,
not only as fit Directors and Judges between Us and Our two Houses of
Parliament, in Business so wholly concerning the Peace and Government of this
Our Kingdom, and in a matter so absolutely entrusted to Us, as what new Laws
to consent or not to consent to; But should assume and publish, That the desire
of Reformation in this Kingdom is in a peaceable and Parliamentary way, When
all the World may know, That the proceedings here, have been and are not only
contrary to all the rules and precedents of former Parliaments, but destructive
to the Freedom, Privilege, and Dignity of Parliaments themselves; That We
were first driven by tumults, for the safety of Our life, from Our Cities of
London and Westminster, and have been since pursued, fought withal, and are
now kept from thence by an Army raised, as is pretended, by the two Houses,
which consist not of the fourth part of the number they ought to do, the rest
being either driven from thence by the same violence, or expelld or imprisoned
(...) not consenting to the Treasons and unheard of Insolences practiced
against Us; And if the Petitioners could believe these proceedings to be in a
peaceable Parliamentary way, they were very unacquainted with the Order and
constitution of this Kingdom, and not so fit instruments to promote that
Reformation and Peace they seem to desire.

We cannot believe the Intermixture of the present Ecclesiastical Government
with the Civil State to be other then a very good reason, and that the
government of the Church should be by the rules of humane policy, to be other
then a very good rule, unless some other government were as well proved as
pretended to be better warranted by God.

Of any Bills offered Us for Reformation, We shall not not now speak, they
being a part of those Articles upon which We have offered and expect to Treat;
But cannot but wonder by what authority you prejudg Our Judgment herein, by
denouncing Gods anger upon Us, and Our hazard of the loss of the hearts of all
Our good Subjects, if We consent not unto them. The influence of so many
blessings from heaven upon the regns of Queen Elizabath, and Our father of
blessed memory, and the acknowledgment of them by all Protestant Churches to
have been careful Nurses of the Church of Christ, and to have excellently
discharged their duties in the custody and vindication of Religion, and the
affection of their Subjects to them, do sufficiently assure Us, that We should
neither stop the influence of such Blessings, nor grieve the hearts of all the
godly, nor hazard the loss of the hearts of Our good Subjects, although We
still maintain in this Kingdom the same established Ecclesiastical government,
which flourisht in their times, and under their special Protection.

We doubt not but Our Subjects of Scotland will rest abundantly satisfied
with such alterations in their own Church as We have assented unto, and not be
persuaded by a mere Assertion, that there is no hope of the continuance of what
is there settled by Law, unless that be likewise altered which is settled here;
And Our Subjects of England will never depart from their dutiful affection to
U^, for not consenting to new Laws, which by the law of the Land, they know, We
may as justy reject if We approve not of them, as either House has power to
prepare for, or both to propound to Us. Nor are you a little mistaken if either
you believe the generality of this Nation to desire a change of
Church Government, or that most of those who desire it, desire by it to
introduce that which you only esteem a Reformation, but are as unwilling to
what you call the yoke of Christ and obedience to the Gospel, as those whom
you call profane and worldly men, and so equally averse both to Episcopacy and
Presbytery, that if they should prevail in this particular, the abolition of
the one would be no let to the other, nor would your hearts be less grieved,
your expectations less frustrated, your hopes less ashamed, or your
Reformation more secured. And the Petitioners, upon due consideration, will not
find themselves less mistaken in the government of all the Reformed Churches,
which they say is by Assemblies, then they are in the best way of a
Reformation, which sure is best to be in a common and ordinary way, where the
passion or interest of particular men may not impose upon the public, but
alteration be then only made, when, upon calm Debates, and evident and clear
Reason and convenience, the same shall be generally consented to for the peace
and security of the people, and those who are trusted by the Law with such
debates, are not divested of that trust upon a general charge of corruptions
pretended to have entered by that way, and of being the persons to be reformed,
and so unfit to be Reformers. And certainly the like Logic with the like
charges and pretenses might be used to make the parliament it self ano
incapable Judge of any Reformation either in Church or State.

For the general Expressions in the Petition against Papists, in which the
Petitioners may be understood to charge Us with compliance and favor even to
their opinions, We have taken all occasion to publish to the world Our practice
and Resolution in the true Protestant Reformed Religion, and we are verily
persuaded there is no one Subject in either of Our Dominions, who at all knows
Us, and has observed Our Life, but is in his Soul satisfied of Our Zeal and
unremoveable Affection to that Religion, and of Our true dislike of and hearty
oposition to popery, And as we willingly c^nsented, at our being in Scotland,
to all Acts proposed to Us, for the discountenancing and Reforming the Papists
in that our Kingdom, so by Our Proclamations for the putting of all Laws
severally in execution against Recusants, and by not refusing any one Bill
presented to Us to that purpose in this Kingdom, and by Our perpetual and
public professions of Readiness with the Advice of Our two Houses of
Parliament prepared for Us in a deliberate and orderly way, to find some
expedition to perfect so good a work, Or conceived we had not left it possible
for any man to believe Us guilty of tolerating any part of the Romish Tyranny
or Supe^stition, or to suspect that the Conversion of Our dearest Consort, was
not so much Our desire, that the Accession of as many Crowns, as God has
already bestowed upon us, would be more welcome to us then that day: A Blessing
which it is Our daily prayer to the Almighty to bestow upon Us.

But We might well have expected from the Petitioners, who have in their
solemn National Covenant literally sworn so much Care of the safety of Our
Person, and cannot but know in how much danger that has bin and still is by
the power and threats of Rebellious Arms, that they would as well have
remembered the 23. of October, as the 5. of November, and as well have taken
notice of the Army raised and led against Us by the Earl of Essex, which has
actually assaulted and endeavored to murder Us, which We know to abound in
Brownists, Anabaptists, and other Sectaries, and in which We have reason (by
the prisoners We have taken, and the Evidence they have given) to believe there
are many more Papists (and many of those forraigners) then in all Our Army, as
have advised Us to disband out of the Army of the Earl of New Castle, which is
raised for Our defense, the papists in that Army, who are known to be no such
number as to endanger their obtaining any power of building their Babell, and
setting up their Idolatry, and whose Loyalty he has reason to commend) though
he was never suspected for favoring their Religion) not before that of
Protestants, but of such as rebel under that Title; And whose assistance is as
due to us by the Law of God, and Man, to rescue Us from domestique Rebellion,
as to defend Us from foreign invasion, which We think no man denies to be
lawful for them to do, But We do solemnly declare and protest, That God
shall no sooner free Us from the desperate and rebellious Arms taken up
against Us, but We shall endeavor to free Our selves and Kingdom from any
fear of danger from the other, by disarming them according to the Laws of
this Land, as We shall not fail to send Our Commissioner to the Assembly at
the time appointed for it by the Laws of Scotland:

To conclude, We desire and require the Petitioners (as becomes good and pious
Preachers of the Gospel) to use their utmost endeavors to compose any
distraction in opinions, or misunderstandings, which may by the Faction of some
turbulent persons, be raised in the minds of Our good Subjects of that Our
Kingdom, and to infuse into them a true sense of Charity, Obedience and
Humility, the great principles of Christian Religion; That they may not suffer
themselves to be transported with things they do not understand, or think
themselves concerned in the Governmenn of another Kingdom, because it is not
according to the customs of that in which they live; But that they dispose
themselves with modesty and devotion to the service of Almighty God, with duty
and affection to tue obedience of Us and Our Laws (remembering the singular
Grace, Favor and Benignity We have always expressed to that Our Native
Kingdom) and with Brotherly and Christian Charity one toward another; And We
doubt not but God in his mercy to Us and them will make Us Instruments of his
Blessings upon each other, and both of Us a great measure of Happiness and
Prosperity to the whole Nation.

FINIS.
