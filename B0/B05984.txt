Strange and true News from Westmoreland.
Being a true Relation of one Gabriel Harding, who coming home drunk, struck
his Wife a blow on the breast, and killed her outright, and then denied the
same: Likewise how a Stranger did come to the House clothed in green, the
people that were eye witnesses said it was an Angel; and how the Stranger or
Angel did give Sentence on the man for killing of his Wife: Also how Satan did
break the man's neck that did forswear himself, and the Stranger or Angel did
command Satan to hurt none else, and to vanish; Then did the Stranger clothed
in green take his leave of the people; whereof he chiefest in the Parish
desired it might be put into Print, and have hereunto set their hands.

Tune is, In Summer time.


ATtend good Christian people all,
Mark what I say both old and young
Unto the General Judgment day
I think it is not very long.
A wonder strange I shall relate,
I think the like was never shown,
In Westmoreland in Tredenton
Of such a thing was never known,
One Gabriel Harding lived of late,
As may to all men just appear,
Whose yearly Rent by just account
Came to five hundred pound a year.
This man he had a Virtuous Wife,
In Godly ways her mind did give:
Yet he as rude a wicked wretch
As in this sinful Land did live.
Much news of him I will relate,
The like no mortal man did hear:
It Is very new, and also true,
Therefore good Christians all give ear.
One time this man he came home drunk
As he used which made his wife to weep,
Who straight way took him by the hand,
Saying, Dear Husband lie down and sleep.
She lovingly took him by the arms,
Thinking in safety him to guide,
A blow he struck her on the breast,
The woman straight sunk down and died.
The Children with mournful cries
They run into the open street,
They wept, they wail'd, they wrung their hands
To all good Christians they did meet.
The people then they all ran forth,
Saying, Children why make you such moan
O make you haste unto our house
Our dear mother is dead and gone.
Our Father has our Mother killed,
The Children they cried then,
The people then they all made haste,
And laid their hands upon the man.
He presently denied the same,
Said from guilty Murder I am free,
If I did that wicked deed he said,
Some example I wish be seen by me.
Thus he forswore the wicked deed,
Of his dear wifes untimely end,
Quoth the people let us conclude with speed,
That for the Coroner we may send.
Mark what I say, the doors fast shut,
The people the Children did deplore,
But straight they heard a man to speak,
And one stood knocking at the door.
One in the house to the door made haste,
Hearing a man to knock and call,
The door was opened presently,
And in he came amongst them all.
By your leave good people then he said,
May a stranger with you have some talk,
A dead woman I am come to see,
Into the Room I pray Sir walk.
His eyes like to the Stars did shine,
He was clothed in a bright Grass green,
His cheeks was of a Crimson red,
For such a man was seldom seen.
Unto the people then he spoke,
Mark well these words which I shall say,
For no Coroner yon shall send
I Am Judge and Jury here this day.
Brng hither the maa that did the deed
And firmly has denied the same
They brought him into the room with speed
To answer to this deed with shame.
Now come O wretched man quoth he,
With shame before thy Neighbors all,
Thy body thou have brought to misery,
Thy soul into a deeper thrall.
Thy chiefest delight was drunkenness
And tewd woman, O cursed sin.
Blasphemous Oaths and Curses vile
A long time thou have wallowed in.
Thy Neighbors thou would set at strife
And always griping of the poor:
Besides thou have murdered thy wife
A fearful death thou dy'st therefore,
Fear nothing good people, then he said
A sight presently will appear,
Let all your trust be in the Lord
No harm shall be while I am here.
Then in the Room the Devil appeared
Like a brave Gentleman did stand;
Satan (quoth he that was the Judge)
Do no more than thou have command.
The Devil then he straight laid hold
On him that had murdered his Wife,
His neck in sunder then he broke,
And thus did end his wretched life,
The Devil then he vanished
Quite from the people in the Hall,
Which made the people much afraid,
Yet no one had no hurt at all.
Then straight a pleasant Melody
Of Music straight was heard to sound,
It ravished the hearts of those stood by,
So sweet the Music did abound.
Now (quoth this gallant man in green)
With you I can no longer stay,
My love I leave, my leave I take,
The time is come, I must away.
Be sure to love each other well,
Keep in your breast what I do say,
It is the way to go to Heaven
When you shall rise at Judgment day.
The people to their homes did go,
Which had this mighty wonder seen,
And said it was an Angel sure
That thus was clothed all in green.
And thus the News from Westmoreland
I have related to you over;
I think it is as strange a thing
As ever man did hear before.
