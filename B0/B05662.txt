A PROCLAMATION For Observing the Staple-port at Camphire,
WILLIAM and MARY by the Grace of GOD, King and Queen of Great Britain, France
and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith;
To (...) Macers of our Privy Council, Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that
part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Forasmuch as by many ancient Contracts past betwixt the Royal burghs of this
our ancient Kingdom, and the Town of Camphire in Zeland, and which have been
approved by the Kings our Predecessors, the whole Trade and Commerce, as to the
Staple-commodities exported from this our Kingdom, to the seventeen Provinces
of the Nether-lands, has been Settled and Established at the said Town of
Camphire, as being found by experience the fittest place for the Scots Staple,
and there being in the former Reigns of our Royal Predecessors many
Proclamations issued forth, requiring all our Subjects traveling to the
seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands, to export all Staple-goods and
Commodities to the said Staple-port, and to no other Port nor place, and
ordaining the Laws and Acts of Parliament, and Acts of the Convention of the
Royal-burghs to be put to due and vigorous Execution, for the full Observance
of the same: And We being informed, that of late, the Staple-trade of this
Kingdom, has been altogether diverted from the said Staple-port at Camphire,
and carried to Roterdam, and other places in the Nether-lands, to the great
Prejudice and Discouragement of Trade, and contrair to the foresaid Agreement
with Camphire, from presences that the said Town of Camphire neither could, nor
would furnish sufficient Convoyes, for convoying the said Ships, both out-ward
and in-ward bound, from and to the said Port now in the time of War. And now it
being Certified to us, that the Magistrates of the Town of Camphire have
engadged to the Royal-burghs, that they will furnish sufficient Convoyes, for
securing of the Trade betwixt that Port and the Firth and Road of Leith, twice
in the year, viz. against the middle of September, and the middle of March
yearly, commensing from the middle of September next; And We being fully
Resolved, that all the standing Laws and Acts of Parliament, and Acts of
Convention of our Royal-burghs, be put to full and vigorous Execution, for the
more due Observance of the said Staple-port for the future; Do therefore with
Advice of the Lords of our Privy Council, hereby require all our Subjects to
give all due and exact Obedience to the foresaids Acts made for observing of
the Staple-por^ Discharging all Merchants and Skippers, or any other our
Subjects, to export forth of this our Kingdom, any Goods or Commodities, that
are or shall be declared to be Staple Commodities, to any other Port or Place
in the Nether-lands, but only to the said Staple-port and Town of Camphire in
Zeland, under the Pains and Certifications mentioned in the said Acts of
Parliament, and Acts of the Convention of Burghs, which Pains and Penalties, We
ordain to be exacted from the Transgressors with all rigor, and that they be
further proceeded against, as our Council shall find Cause. And further, We
with Advice foresaid, do hereby Require the General Farmers, Tacksmen, or
Collectors of our Customs, and their Sub-collectors, Surveyers for the time
being, that they make exact search and trial of all Staple goods and
Commodities that shall be hereafter transported forth of this Kingdom, to any
Port of the seventeen Provinces of the Nether-lands, and take sufficient
Security from the Merchants or Skippers transporters thereof, that they shall
transport the same to the said Staple-port at Camphire, and at no other Place
nor Port within the said seventeen Provinces, and that they shall not break
Bulk before their arrival thereat, conform to the Acts of Parliament, oblidging
the said Exporters to report Certificats from the Conservator, or his Deputs at
Camphire, bearing, that the said Staple-commodities were livered thereat,
without breaking Bulk; And We do Ordain the said Testificats, to be delivered
in Quarterly by the Collectors at the several Ports, to the Agent of our
Royal-burghs for the time, to the end exact Diligence may be done by him,
against all the Transgressors of the said Staple, conform to the said Acts.
OUR WILL IS HEREFORE, and We charge you strictly and Command, that incontinent
these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and whole
remanent Royal-burghs of this Kingdom, and other places needful, and thereat,
in Our Name and Authority, by open Proclamation make publication of the
Premises, to the effect, Our Royal-burghs, and all Merchants and other
Persons, may have timeous notice hereof, and give due and punctual Obedience
thereto, as they will be answerable at their outmost Perril, The which to do,
We commit to you conjunctly and severally Our full Power by these Our Letters,
