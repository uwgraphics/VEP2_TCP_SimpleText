Scadlock married the Princess.
Tune of, Robin Hood; or, Hey down, down a down.
Licensed and Entered.





NOw Robin Hood, Will. Scadlock and Little John,
are walking over the plain,
With a good fat buck which Will Scadlock
with his strong bow had slain.
Iog on, jog on, cries Robin Hood,
the day it runs full fast,
For though my Nephew me a breakfast gave,
I have not yet broke my fast.
Then to yonder lodge, let us take our way,
I think it wondrous good,
Where my Nephew by my bold Yeomen,
shall be welcomed unto the green-wood.
With that he took the bugle-horn,
full well he could it blow:
Straight from the woods came marching down
one hundred tall Fellows and mo.
Stand, stand to your arms, cries Will. Scadlock,
lo the Enemies are within ken.
With that Robin Hood he laughed aloud,
cries, They are my bold Yeoman,
Who when they arrived, and Robin espied,
(...) cried, Master, What is your will?
We thought you had in danger been,
your horn did sound so shrill.
Now nay, now nay, quoth Robin Hood,
the danger is past and gone,
I would have you to welcome my Nephew here,
that has paid me two for one.
In feasting and sporting they passed the day,
till Phoebus sunk into the deep;
Then each one to his quarters hy'd,
his guard there for to keep.
Long had they not walked within the green-wood,
but Robin he was espied
Of a beautiful Damsel all alone,
that on a black palfrey did ride.
Her riding-shit was of sable hew black,
^press over her fa^^e,
Though which her rose-like cheeks did blush
all with a comely grace
Come tell me the cause, thou pretty One,
quoth Ro^in, and ^e^l me a right,
From whence thou come, and whither thou go,
all in this mournful plight?
From London I came the Damsel replied,
from London upon the Thames,
Which circled is O grief to tell,
besieged with foreign Arms:
By the proud Prince of Aragon,
who swears by his martial hand,
To have the Princess to his Spouse,
or else to waste this Land:
Except that Champions can be found,
that dare fight three to three,
Against the Prince and Giants twain,
most horrid for to see:
Whose grissy looks, and eyes like brands,
strike terror where they come,
With serpents hissing on their helms,
instead of feathered plume.
The Princess shall be the Victor's Prize,
the King has vowed, and said,
And he that shall the conquest win,
shall have her to his Bride.
Now we are four Damsels sent abroad
to the East, West, North, and South,
To try whose fortune is so good,
to find these Champions forth.
But all in vain we have sought about,
yet none so bold there are,
That dare adventure life and blood,
to free a Lady fair.
When is the day (...) quoth Robin Hood,
tell me this, and no more.
On Midsummer next, the Damsel said,
which is ^une the twenty four.
With that the tears tricksed down her checks,
and silent was her tongue,
With sighs and sobs, she took her leave,
away her palfrey sprung.
This News struck Robin to the heart,
he fell down on the grass,
His action and his troubled mind,
showed he perplexed was.
Where lies your grief? quoth Will. Scadlock,
O Master tell to me;
If the Damsels eyes have pierced your heart,
I Will fetch her back to thee.
Now nay, now nay; quoth Robin Hood,
she does nor cause my smart,
But it is the poor distressed Princess,
that wounds me to the heart.
I will go fight the Giants all,
to set the Lady free.
The Devil take my soul, quoth Little John,
if I part with thy company.
Must I stay behind? quoth Will. Scadlock,
no, no, that must not be;
I Will make the third Man in the fight,
so we shall be three to three.
These words cheered Robin at the heart,
joy shone within his face,
Within his arms he hugged them both,
and kindly did unbrace.
Quoth he, We'll put on mothly gray,
with long staves in our hands,
A scrip and bottle by our sides,
as ^ome from the Holy Land:
So may we pass along the highway,
none will ask from whence we came,
But take us Pilgrims for to be,
or else some Holy-men.
Now they are on their journey gone,
as fast as they may speed,
Yet for all have, e're they arrived,
the Princess forth was led,
To be delivered to the Prince,
who in the List did stand,
Prepared to fight, or else receive
his Lady by the hand.
With that he walked about the lists,
with Giants by his side,
Bring forth, quoth he, your Champions,
or bring me forth my Bride:
This is the four and twentieth day,
the day perfixt upon;
Bring forth my Bride, or London burns,
I swear by Acaron.
Then cries the King and Queen likewise,
both weeping as they speak,
Lo, we have brought our Daughter dear,
whom we are forced to forsake.
With that stepped out bold Robin Hood,
cries, My Liege, it must not be so,
Such Beauty as the fair Princess,
is not for a Tyrant's ^ow.
The Prince he then began storm,
cries, Fool, Fanatic, Baboon,
How dares thou stop my Valor's Prize?
I Will kill thee with a frown.
Thou Tyrant, Turk, thou Infidel,
thus Robin began to reply,
Thy frowns I scorn, lo here is my gage,
and thus I thee defy:
And for those two Goliahs there,
that stand on either side,
Here are two little David's by,
that soon can tame their pride.
Th^^ did the King for armor send,
for lances, swords and shields;
And thus all three in armor bright
came marching to the field.
The trumpets began to sound a charge,
each singled out his Man,
Their arms in pieces soon were hewed,
blood sprang from every vain:
The Prince he reached Robin a blow,
he struck with might and main,
Which forced him to re^l about the field,
as though he had been slain.
God-a-mercy, quoth Robin, for that blow,
the Quarrel shall soon be tried
This stroke shall show a full divorce,
betwixt thee and the Bride.
So from his shoulders he is cut his head,
which on the ground did fall,
And grumbling sore at Robin Hood,
to be so dealt withal.
The Giants then began to rage,
to see their Prince lie dead;
Thou's be the next, quoth Little John,
except thou well guard thy head:
With that his faulchion be wherl'd about,
it was both keen and sharp.
He clove the Giant to the belt,
and cut in twain his heart.
Will. Scadlock well had played his part,
the Giant he brought to his knee,
Quoth he, The Devil cannot break his fast,
unless he have you all three:
So with his faulchion he run him through,
a deep and gashly wound,
who damned and foamed, cursed and blasphemed,
and then fell to the ground,
Now all the lists with sheets were filled,
the skies they did resound,
Which brought the Princess to herself,
who was fallen in a swound.
The King, and Queen, and Princess fair,
came walking to the place,
And gave the Champions many thanks,
and did them further grace.
Tell me, quoth the King, whence you are
that thus disguised came,
Whose valor speaks that noble blood
does run through every vain?
A boon, a boon, quoth Robin Hood,
on my knees I beg and crave.
By my Crown, quoth the King, I grant,
ask what, and thou shall have.
Then pardon I beg for my merry Men,
which are within the green-wood,
For Little John, and Will. Scadlock,
and for me bold Robin Hood,
Art thou Robin Hood then? quoth the King,
for the valor you have shown,
Your pardons I do freely grant,
and welcome every one.
The Pricess I promised the Victor's Prize,
she cannot have you all three:
She shall choose, quoth Robin; says Little John,
Then little share falls to me.
Then did the Princess view all three,
with a comely lovely grace,
Who took Will. Scadlock by the hand,
quoth, Here I make my choice.
With that a noble Lord s^ept forth,
of Maxfield Earl was he,
Who looked Will. Scadlock in the face,
then wept most bitterly:
Quoth he, I had a Son like thee,
whom I loved wondrous well,
But he is gone, or rather dead,
his name is young Gamwell.
Then did Will. Scadlock fall on his knees,
cries, Father, Father, here,
Here kneels your Son, your young Gamwell,
you said you loved so dear.
But, Lord! what inbracing and kissing was there,
when all these Friends were met:
They are gone to the wedding, and so to bedding,
and so I did you good night.
