AN OVT-PORT-CVSTOMERS ACCOUNT, Of all his Receipts, to a Shilling, or a Penny,
without concealment or enstaulement of any; according to his Oath at his first
Admission.

Wherein he plainly sets down, as well the Motives and Occasions, as the
Method and Style of all his former writings; namely, his first APOLOGY for
CVSTOMERS, against Informers of all sorts. His REPLY, or second APOLOGY for
public Traffic, against Private Societies. His CAVTION for Subsidies, under
the Name of Customs, against Extremity by Farmers. His ALPHABET and PRYMER
for orderly Commerce. His ACROAMATA for Bullion and Staples: Besides his late
MYSTERY of INIQVITIE. All which, howsoever heretofore held hard and obscure;
are here out of Rules of Divinity, and Humanity together, by way of
Illustration, fitted to Capacity of Common Sense and Reason; for the fuller
satisfaction of all impartial Readers, fearing GOD sincerely, and uprightly
serving KINGS, and such as are not desperately wilful, to make Shipwreck of
their Consciences, and despise their own Happiness. With an open Declaration
of the MYSTERY itself, to perfect this Account. Summa Totalis. The CVSTOMERS
Resolution. Summa Summarum, His daily Confession, Hearty Prayer with
Thanksgiving; and QVIETVS-EST. And a short Memorandum, in Perpetuam Rei
Memoriam, for the KINGS special Honor, his Loyal Subjects Good, and his
CVSTOMERS discharge, from all Imputations both past and to come, against
Ignorance and her Fellows.

PSALM 37. Keep Innocence, and take heed unto the Thing that is Right, for
that shall bring a Man PEACE at the last.

OR THVS. Mark the Perfect Man, and behold the upright, for the End of that
Man is PEACE. Dilige quae Bona sunt, Rectum cole, Iusta require; Haec faciens,
alma PACE beatus eris.

THE CVSTOMERS ACCOUNT.
THE number is but small, at least not very great, of Men that are so
senseless and weak of Judgment, but general Inconveniences they readely see,
and can easily discern. Notwithstanding, to find out the Grounds of public
harms, and the means how to cure them, is a study so intricat, and a practice
so dangerous, that wary men hold it safer to provide for private ease, in
regard of the Times, then to busy their wits for any Common-Good.

But how advised soever, and respectively wise in this kind, the most sort
seem to be, as wishing only that all might go well, though not long of
themselves: yet few or none are found of so still a temper as not to complain,
when public greefes work their own sensible smarts.

Such then, as by long and extraordinary patience, supping up their private
wrongs, have endeavored to give way to the stream of public Contumelies, in
hope of better days; must needs be excused, if compeld at the last (by
lawless necessity) to refer events to GODS Providence, in discharge of their
Duties to HIM, their PRINCE, and COUNTRY, they undertake the Defense of their
own Reputations, in a Cause public and general. The rather, when as without
purpose of offending any, their intentions appear to yield only a reason of
such and such Disorders in their own present Functions, as for want of serious
inspection, or true information, have hitherto by Jealousy and misconceit
only, yielded matter and occasions of their special Disgraces and Obloquy.

Even such and none other, have the Drifts and Scopes been of all my former
Writings, about Traffic and her Tributes, by the general Name of Customs.
For having spent and consumed the best part of my youth about public
Employments, as well at home as abroad, in FRANCE, FLANDERS, and SCOTLAND, for
sixteen years together; after the TREATY that was ended at Barwicke, 1586.
between the late Queen ELIZABETH, of most happy Memory, and our now dread
Sovereign JAMES; (called Foedus arctioris Amicitiae inter Potentissimos, etc.
The RECORD whereof in Scotland remains of my hand) which by the Goodness of
God, the truth of his Title, and his own Patience together, was a special
means, that at last brought his Majesty so happily among us, and so quietly
hither: desirous to betake me to some staid course of life; I was by Friends
persuaded to become CVSTOMER of Sandwich, with the Member-Ports belonging,
within the shire of KENT, where I was both bred and born, assuring me withal,
that I might thereby, do GOD, my SOVEREIGN, and my COUNTRY special service,
and so become Happy.

Now Happiness indeed being that estate of life, which all at least wish for,
and by all means belay, and the objects of all Happiness being fixed in GOD
and KINGS; by serving KINGS Loyally, Men hope to be happy, and so did I. Upon
which Motive (therefore) being urged so by Friends, I undertook the charge
Simply, and doubted no harm.

But GOD becomes abused, and KINGS may be deceived, and so was I, and so become
many, that seek after Happiness by collecting Customs (in the Out-Ports at
least) as the case now stands. For the service being pretended and attended on
by many, each values himself above other, and his Place and standing to be of
most importance. But Multa sunt quae non videntur, and Multa videntur quae non
sunt omnino. For Customs indeed, and properly taken (like the Tithes of a
Church, and Quitrents of a Manor) being natural Effects of that weighty Cause
(TRAFFIQVE) whose Actions are conversant, about no meaner Obiectes, then
Sovereigns Honor, and Subjects Wealth, and as due to Kings as the Crown on
their heads; imply a service both of special respect, and absolute trust;
wherein four things there are, or ought to be concurrent, to Customer, and
justify his calling. First, the Institution, Ports and Places laid out and
allotted for the Countenance and Maintenance fit for such a calling.

All this notwithstanding, I was no sooner entered, but I found my self
surprisde; my former Liberty, turned into Thraldom, like the Bondage of
Aegipt; and my Life become subject to the Inquisition of Spain. For Jealousy
and Suspicion first bound me hand and foot, and swearing me withal To do my
best endeavor, to deal justly and uprightly between the Prince and the People,
sent me to my charge in those Deserts and Plains, next the Wilderness of
Sin, and great FOREST OF SHIFTS; Namely, to SANDVVICH, with the Members; as
Dover, Feuersham, Milton, and Rochester, within the Shire of Kent. Where for my
comfort, I found and might discern, (which I could not see before) how
Traffic (on whom our work depends) hanged awry, went backward and forward as
one that were bewitched, and deprived of all her Cordials Cata-Pantos, Cat'auto,
and Cath'olou-proton, was subject to swooning, and often in a trance, her Face
pale and wan, her Pulses dull and dead, and all for want of Staples.

Her Ports either abandond, like places infected or haunted with Spirits, or
else beset with Harpies by Sea and by Land, to worry her from thence, if by
chance she came thither.

Her Houses neither Wind-tight, nor Water-tight, were stuffed with such
Instruments as loved her Customs, but as Rats do love Cheese.

And for all the Security (by Bonds or otherwise) that an honest Man can give,
a Christian may afford, or Wisdom devise: Her Servants still mistrusted, and
made Objects of Disgrace,
Bewrayed their small maintenance by the thinness of their Cheeks:
And their Service made a means to fat others in their place,
Whilst they drank cold Water, and were glad to leap at Leekes.
In a word, I saw Traffic out of Order.

Yet I could not marvel tho,
For all on private profit wait,
Where Proiects guided by conceit,
Made work for Seeming-Goods deceit;
And one Man's will, made all Men's woe.
This made me to rub where it did not itch before, and smothering up my
grief, to wish as others did; O mihi praeteritos referat si Jupiter annos!

But, being thus a Customer in Name, at the least, and apt enough to learn,
though not able yet to teach; I spent the first two years in observing of
others, and bemoand my self by fits, as I durst upon occasions, by words and
writings: first unto our Hushers, I bemoand the Disorders of the Custom
services, and Out-Port-Customers Distress, to Master Thomas Fanshawe Esquire,
then Remembrancer of the Exchequer, to whose Study and Table I was often kindly
welcome, first privately by conference, and afterward by writing, who showed
the same to the Lord chief Baron Peryam, and He to the Lord Tresurer
Burghley, but nothing came of it, which made me at last appeal to the
COVNSEL-TABLE.
and then by constraint, in a serious set discourse of the present estate of
Customs, in the Out-Portes of this Land, not so publicly then printed, as
privately directed, To the Grauest, and Godly wise, in highest authority: by
the Title and Inscription of THE CVSTOMERS APOLOGY, in these words following.

The Epistle of the APOLOGY.
A GENTLEMAN, a Friend, and a Lover of Learning, coming into a Free-Schoole,
where diverse young Scholars were learning their Grammers, desirous to feel
how they thriud at their Books, by some familiar question, demanded (their
Hushers standing by) When an English is given to be made into Latin, what is
first to be done? The answer is easy; Namely, To look out the principal
Verb, but all stood silent, and as half amazed, till ONE at the last, the
question being repeated, and he urged to speak, what was to be done, replied:
No harm Sir I hope, at least that I wot of. Which the Gentleman then took in
very good part, and suspecting rather Ignorance in the Hushers, then want of
wit in the Scholar, departed smiling.

Most Reverend and Right Honorable; This Question and Answer, encludeth the
State of all the Students in the Free-Schooles and Ports of our Sovereigns
Customs, where such as the Teachers be, such are the Scholars. There Is a
Reason for all things: And the reason hereof is not so much for want of wit or
will in the Learners, to deal justly between the Prince and the People; Which
in this kind of Doctrine is the principal Verb, as in the sternnesse of
Hushers, who whilst the Grave Masters and Moderators of the Schools, were
busied and distracted in the study and practice of higher points of Learning,
have used no Method but beating the Scholars: Qui paria esse volunt peccata,
Ipsique laborant
Cum ventum ad verum est, sensus moresque repugnant,
Atque ipsa Vtilitas, Iusti prope Matter and Aequi.
That make all faults alike, yet they themselves are domme,
When Truth in question falls, each Fingers seems a Thomme:
And Profit holds the Seat alone, where Honor first should come.


Which kind of Discipline, discouraging all Men, and driving many good wits
from the School, to the secret injury of the whole Commonwealth, for'st me to
my Book, and as well as I could, to analize my Lesson, meaning thereby with
the aforesaid plain Scholar; No harm at all. Such therefore as it is, I have
breefely set down in the Discourse following. The Matter whereof, partly drawn
from mine own Patience and Experience: and partly, observed and learned from
others: The Form (I confess) is merely mine own, and has for my warrant,
the Rules of my Grammar.

And since things are then well done, when things are well taken. To clear
and acquit me from partial clamor, and the sin of Presumption: The will
applyant to reason, is guiltless of passion, and Nature ouer-borne, appeals
to necessity. Quae quod cogit ipsa, solet vtique defendere. Hard therefore, and
above measure extreme must their cases appear, that still subject to beating,
may neither bemoane themselves, nor be suffered to cry. And so much the rather,
when as So far as I wot of, in all their complaints so tenderly touched, and
breefely run over, there is nothing concluded nor included, at least intended
thereby, but a natural Defense of an honest Reputation, in that kind of
calling, which the Law it self in great Wisdom has laid out and reserved;
For Men of best sort only, and a dutiful zeal to find out thereby The
Principal Verb.

But, Pro captu Lectoris habent sua fata Libelli. I sought to find comfort,
and light upon new comber; For the APOLOGY being written for understanding
Readers, and the Matter so digested, that by reading it only without Gloss or
Comment, Passion or Partiality, such might be their own and other Men's Judges,
was notwithstanding by Ignorance oddely censured, The APOLOGY strangely
censured by Ignorance.
and strangely mistaken, Vainly striving to make good that within Book which
never was in question, and maliciously urging some things without Book, never
meant nor mentioned, nor fit to be defended. But with such success as still
befalls folly, who delighting to see her own shaddowe dance, has not the grace
to conceal her own shame. I set but lightly by it when the thing was first
brought me, till I saw the Book twice printed at MIDLEBOROVGH and LONDON, then
least he that ran alone, might think himself still foremost; I was for'st to
say something, and Replied in this manner. The Motive and occasion of the REPLY.


About such time, is by the Goodness of GOD, The Method and Style of the
Customers REPLY.
the light of the Gospel, began to lay open the errors of Superstition in
these parts of the World, and by the hands of our Sovereigns, to disperse them
in this Kingdom, sundry questions were moved to uphold some points of the
Popish Religion, but none for the time were so hotly disputed, as those which
they term, The Sacrament of the Altar, and praying to Saints. Whereof,
amongst others, a certain young Scholar, more confident then wise, having
newly undertaken a serious Defense; as one sick of love with the thing he had
begotten, and ambitiously affecting the publishing of it, entreated a Friend of
his, whom he knew to be both learned and well minded to the Cause to read it
first over. The request was performed; but when as looking still for Arguments
fitting the question, he found nothing at all but a needless endeavor, to
approve and maintain by the Catholic Creed. What? That JESUS CHRIST was the
true Son of God, very God, and very Man, that redeemed the World, and That
there was also a Communion of Saints: The Book was returned with a slender
smile, but no applaud at all, or show of satisfaction.

Right Honorable, such was the success of a like late learned Writer, who
Printing a Treatise of public Commerce, (such was his Title) in favor of a
private society, or Conclaue of Merchants, with very much ado, and a heap of
silly words, (far unfitting the Gravity of his Theme) set all his wit to
work, and endeuour'd all he could, to persuade his Reader. What? That
Traffic, forsooth, rightly ordered, was the Honor of Kings, and Prosperity
of Kingdoms; and withal, that Trades and Occupations, Arts and Mysteries,
were at al hands to be cherrished, and Merchants likewise favored in every
Commonwealth, which none but Fools or mad men (to my understanding) did ever
yet deny.

But it is strange to observe, what strong apprehensions are able to work in
weak men's brains. For as a plain simple Man in reading his Belief, was
sometimes persuaded, that if Pontius Pylate had not been a Saint, the Apostles
would never have suffered his Name to stand in the Creed: so this Catholic
Writer, reading in a This Treatise was written by one of Embden, 1564. about
the beginning of the Divisions of the House of Burgundy, and Colloquy of
Bruges, to show the Emperor and P P. of Germany, the great advantage the King
of Spain then had over all Christendom, by the Load-stones of England still
transported thither, earnestly apprehending the fitness of the time, and happy
occasion then offered, to draw them from Antwarp to Embden, for the good of
the Empire. All which Master Wheeler, Secretary to the Merchant Adventurers,
in his Treatise of Commerce, seems to make his own (Sic vos non vobis) and
leaving the Matter, admires only the Men, and falls down before the Persons,
that for their private profit transport them still over, and would persuade the
World to commit the like Idolatry.
Treatise by a Stranger, long since written, a full discourse at large, of the
Golden blissings of ENGLAND; turning Creekes into Ports, joining Ports unto
Towns, raising Towns into Cities, and enriching whole Countries with
Artificers and Trades, Mariners and Shipping, wheresoever they became: in the
strength of his conceit (seeing Pride bewitched with Couetise, and puffed up with
flattery) would bear the world in hand, that the life of all our Traffic and
Welfare of GREAT BRITAIN, stood wholely or cheefely, by the standing and
supporting of his private Society. Applauding their Greatness and Happiness,
besides by their mannaging of Traffic within themselves, commending their
disposing, mincing, abridging, restraining, swearing, and confining the store
and Staples thereof, (not showing Cui Bono) within the walls of Places out of
sight, beyond Seas colored with the Title of their special Mart-Townes. And
above all, extolling their excellent wits and absolute cunning, in moulding
Laws by mere Discretion, to hold all men under, and themselves still above.
For sending, or sailing but cross the narrow Seas, without hazard of Gods, or
danger of Persons more then usual or ordinary. And for wearing Chains of Gold
about their Necks, Cappes with Green Feathers, Hats with white Feathers,
Purple Velvet Buskins, Guilt Rapiers, Daggers, Bridles, and Spurs, at
Triumphs beyond Seas, and public meetings there: But cheefely, for feeding,
maintaining, and setting to work, thousands of Strangers there, when God
knows the wants, and hears the cries of Myriades for idleness at home; would
feign persuade others (being bound to admire the^ himself) that their PONTIVS
or Governor, was for skill the PILAT, for Gravity the POPE, and for wisdom the
Oracle of all orderly Commerce. Their private Decrees, above Common Laws at
home, or Treatises abroad. Their particular Synodes, above General Counsels,
and their Conclaue or Company, a Communion of Saints: pronouncing all that
withstand, distaste or dislike their Doctrine, or contemn their Discipline, for
ENTERLOPERS; that is to say, Heretics, Schismatickes, and excommunicated
Persons, not worthy to breath so much as common Air, or live in any well
ordered Commonwealth. Concluding at last thus strongly withal. That these Men
thus put in special trust, with the transporting of the Credit of our
Kingdom, the very Cream of our Land, and cheifest of our Load-stones, whereby
we should draw Bullion (CLOTH) must needs be reputed, more loyal to their
Sovereigns, more serviceable to the State, more welcome to our Neighbors; and
therefore more to be honored then any other men (be they never so Freeborn)
with a Name above all Names, of MARCHANT-ADVENTVRERS.

With this and such like stuff, the Book being confusedly fraught. Cuius
contrarium verissimum est; might well have been suffered to have did in the
Birth, had it not been mingled with aspersions of untruths, and Obloquies
withal, against the poor Customers of the Out-Ports of this Realm.
Customers! A kind of Creatures, capable as well of Religion as Reason, Freemen
by birth, and of best education, Men every way happy, save in their Names and
Calling, and in nothing more wretched, then in the place of their Functions.
The Out-Ports of this Realm. O thrice happy LONDON! Men (I say) that by the
curious eye of the Law, chosen of the best and most sufficient that Wisdom
can find, or choice afford, would feign retain the reputation, if not of
Saints, yet of Christians at least, and plain honest men.

But as Men once suspected, are said to be half hanged, so fares it with
Customers, for with them above all men, it is not enough to be an honest man.
Leaving therefore mine Antagonist, to believe still in the Christian Catholic
and Apostolic Creed, whose Articles assuredly, are holy all, and true,
though PONTIVS PILATS name stand for no Saint. I sent the rest to the Story of
ISIS, whose Image of Gold it was, that Men so admired in all Places where it
came, and not the beauty of the Beast that bare it; and ploughing with a Heyser
Anno 1564. At, or about the time of the Colloquy of Bruges, A Merchant
Aduenturer, to inform the State at home, of the grounds of such Disorders in
the matter of Traffic, as then the world was disquieted withal; out of
Conscience and Duty, bewrayed the practices, and advantages of that Company by
Usury, which they still call Exchange. A Copy of whose Discourse lying by me,
I joined to my Reply, without adding or altering, save only the Praeface or
Introduction, and Epilogue or Conclusion, to help out the Method, and giving it
a Title which it had not before.
that had sometimes been their own. I answered his Treatise with a
Counter-Treatise, of Exchange in Merchandise, and Marchandizing Exchange,
wherein was laid open by plain Demonstration, the Canker of Traffic, and all
mutual Commerce: I say, an open Detection of that Contempt of Law, Disdain of
Equity, Scorn of Sovereignty, and Dishonor of Kings. And a lively Description
of that Monster of Creete (VSVRY) devouring by daily, monthly, and yearly
Tributes, the Bodies of Men, and Souls of Christians, his Hatching and Brood,
his Muces and Hauntes, his practice and shifts, his shape and his Name, by the
Title of Marchandizing Exchange. The Labyrinth of whose inextricable Errors,
none may safely enter, and whose Person none can encounter and quell but fatal
THESEUS, assisted by the thread of address, and counsel of ARYADNE. A
discourse proiected to give light unto others, but happily reserved by the
providence of GOD, to honor our AEGEVS, to preserve our THESEUS, and bliss
our days withal.

How the Customer became first engaged and provoked to Apologize for Traffic,
as well as for Customers.
For Traffic by this means, as well as for Customers, being formerly bound,
then thus provoked and drawn on by degrees; I became at last confident and
bold to contend, the raising whereof, like Honny in Hiues, increases Customs.
But not that Traffic forsooth, which he childishly described, bartring
Points for Pinnes, or Gossiping with Women. Nor that Traffic, which to
Fodder us with Folly, or to fat us up with Pride, brings Toys and TOBACCO,
little Bells and Bables, Hawkes-Hoods and Hobby Horses, together with Silks and
Veluets, Cambricks and Lawnes, for our better Commodities, of Wool,
Wooll-felles, and Cloth, Tin, Lead, and Leather, destined for Bullion. But
that Traffic, which every way subsisting of Goodness and Truth, both in
Number, Weight, and Measure, by turning all our Load-stones into fine Silver
and pure Gold, makes Kings and Kingdoms happy. Which when I came to view, and
withal to consider, how like a Coach disordered she hung at one side: seeing
AEGEVS with his ISIS, and our THESEUS his Son, the hope of our happiness,
with all the Royal Issue, sitting close therein together; my heart began to
fall, and my hair to rise. For Traffic being the Chariot that bears our
GLORIOUS LIGHTS; I found her Harness worn, and her Wheels displa'st. The
strong Spokes of CUSTOMS supplyd with weak Subsidies of Tonnage and Pondage,
and those likewise lined with ITALIAN Impositions. And perceiving a far off a
certain kind of Horsemen, The Motive and occasion of the CAVTION.
like the four Sons of AYMON, or the Mynotaure of CREETE, then proudly setting
forward, from the Wilderness of Sin, and FOREST OF SHIFTS, to bound over
our Deserts, and undertake her at adventure out of order as she was, and draw
us all in Triumph: I could not but cry out. And seeing as I did, (my standing
made me see, and my seeing moved my Conscience not to hold my peace) both the
looseness of their raines, their bits within their teeth, the dangers of their
course, over Hills and Dales, Bawkes, and many By-waies, and all without a
Coachman or Guide that I could spy, (they out-running al, and controleable by
none for hindering of their course) I could not I say, out of Duty, Fear, and
Zeal, to our Sovereigns special safety, and all our happy beings, but give
CAVTION before hand of the fierceness of their Courage and desperate Carrier,
that they that then stood nigh them might be warned at least to look but to
their heels.

For there being but two maine Subsidies, The Method and Style of the CAVTION.
which Love was desirous that Loyalty should offer by way of humble presents,
to honor our Sovereign with, at his first coming hither, (besides his
Customs, which as tide unto this Crown, were his own before;) namely, the
Subsidy of Tonnage and Pondage, and that of Lands and Goods.

The first (usually mistermed by the general Name of Customs) are those
special tokens of affectionate Love, which Merchants freely give, and humbly
present to MAJESTY, and none other, for maintenance of the Navy, and safe
passage at Seas. The other likewise, tokens and frank offerings of Loyalty,
from Subjects to their Sovereign, for maintenance of Royalty, and Defense of
the Kingdom.

Both these twins of one birth, borne under one Law, named at one Font, knowing
no Motive but Love, no Mould but Loyalty, no Object but Royalty, no use but
Equity, no Ends but the safety of the King and Commonwealth, without
difference at all save only this. That the first by Parliament is for term
of life given him once for all. The second by Parliaments, are usually renewed.

Notwithstanding this one being of both, and one kind of beginning: yet in
their several Collections, to the wonder of God and Angels, they are made so
to differ, that the first seems merely servile and subject to bondage: The
second, Freeborn. This point alone but seriously weighed, would rectify all
Disorder in Custome-seruice, and quit Customers from disgrace and blame.
The first, exposde to all kind of Extreamities, and thereby put to Shifts: The
other, maintainde by Mercy, Loyalty, and Love. In the one, the least part or
shred of each man's Lands and Goods, is held sufficient. In the Merchandise of
the other, all, and in some things more then all, is not held enough* Lastly,
the first, a disturbance to the Merchant, and Customers Disgrace. The second, a
daily credit and countenance to all her Receivers.

Now, great has been the care indeed, and inventions sundry that have been
undertaken, for the advancing, receiving, and true answering, even of these
very Subsidies of Tonnage and Pondage, as well as of Customs, but the
Collections of either being every way disordered, and the words themselves
mistaken; the one for the other, Moule-hils become Mountains, and Complaints
beget Complaints, to the Customers daily cumber, disgrace, and only blame. Who
being bound hands and feet by Jealousy and Suspicion (without accusing any,
for that was the Devils part even from the beginning) plead only for
themselves, but the Law of God and Nature; Quod imputari non debet ei per que^
non stat si non facit quod per ipsum est faciendum, whose reason goes withal,
That Culpa careat oportet, qui scit and prohibere nequit: Yet are so far withal
from justifying themselves, and excusing of others, that they willingly
confess. Faults there are, ever were, and ever will be many. Perfection knows
no Residence but Heaven, disclaimes private directions in public affairs,
distrust their own discretion, and therefore cries alowde as they may, dare,
or can, but ADSIT REGVLA.

HORACE.
,,For Haud Natura potest Iusto secernere Iniquum, etc.
It is not in Discretions hand, nor power to stay,
Or hold the tickle Scales of Iustiec still upright:
Nor is that Reason good, that make all one by day,
To crop a Neighbors Garden-Leekes, and rob a Church by night.
ARVLE must guide the whole, to keep the parts from swaruing,
And punish faults in every one, according to deserving.
And not to think that every slip,
Like deadly Sin deserves a whip.
Besides, their Helpers are their Hinderers: For their Searchers being no
Saints, as they cannot live by the Air, so they know not how to fish but in
pudled Waters. Their Comptrollers know no Rules, but Actum agere. And their
violent Superuisors, crying Halfers were good Fishers, like confident
Empirickes, with repercussiue Medicines so tormented poor Traffic, that
driving her at last, from the Lyme-kill to the Col^-pit; it grew to be a
question, to Farm out her Subsidies of Tonnage and Pondage, together with her
Customs. A strange kind of Plaster for Sores of this Nature; as if Loyalty
and Love were things transferrent, from that Royal Pre-eminence, that gives
it Life and being, and the Homage of Subjects, and honor of Kings, were
vendible for Money, or fit for Farmers.

Though other Kingdoms do the like, as some object and say; England lives by
Laws. Examples may illustrate, but conclude no necessity of general
imitation. For Governments are diverse, some better, and some worse, and England
with the best, may rather give then take example; Et praestat legibus obedire
quod amodo Iniquis, quam viro bono quantumuis optimo, since one man's will may
be all men's woe.

Besides, if Reformation speed best in looking backward, al men may know, that
it was not thus with Customers from the beginning, to be subject to blame for
their own sins and others, till creeping Caterpillars, blown in by
Easterne-winds, and whispering Informers, bred up in muddy waters, were
cherisht and maintained, whom Wisdom in all ages still shund or destroyed. And
I showed a plain example, not yet by all forgotten, that there was a time,
when a Creature of this crew, to curry favor with a worthy Lord TREASVROVR,
The Lord Treasurer Paulet, in whose days if a Customer coming up to the
Term, had not dynde or supt with him before his departure, he had been sure
of Purseuant to fetch him up again. And a Merchants Bond or Bill, allowd in
his Account, as any ready Money.
came fraighted with complaints against the Town and Port of SANDVVICH, for
transportation and dealings there, laying his complaints cheefely upon Packes
of Cloth and Beer, wherein as he conceived, the Prince was much abused. The
Tale being told, and heard out to the end, the Relator was demanded whence,
and what he was, who answered; A Citizen of London, but no Merchant at all.
What makes thee (quoth his L.) to see so far of, and so skild in Merchants
causes? The Princes service (quoth the Fellow) and the means that I have to
know the doings there. His L. seeing his confidence upon these two grounds,
descends to particulars, and first desires to know of him, how, and whereof the
Sandwich Beer was made. The River of Delf running through Sandwich.
Who readely could describe the running stream that serves the Towns use, and
maintains the Haven there. When they Brew not (quoth his L.) whether runs
that Water? Into the Sea (quoth the Fellow?) And what make they then of it?
Nothing. And Brew they, or Brew they not, they want no Water? No my Lord (quoth
He) for the stream ever running, keeps the River full. So that (quoth his L.)
the same Water, whose course is continual, being Brewde, yields something,
and not brewde, nothing? Nothing (quoth He.) Why then in good faith (quoth his
Honor) be thou ruled by me, and let them boil it on the Fire, and with a few
Hops and some Malt, make something of the water, be it never so small, for the
least something that may be, is, and will be still, better then nothing at all.

Now for the Packes (quoth his L.) know thou whose they are? They belong
(quoth He) to Merchants, that send them down thither, but their Names I cannot
tell. Are they simply their own that send them to vent and dispose? Yes my
Lord (quoth He) before they be transported. Then though they be shipped, if
they cross not the Seas, the PRINCE has no interest in them, nor profit by
them? None at all (quoth the Fellow) for from Port to Port, both Land and Seas
are free.

Well then (quoth his L.) I perceive a good meaning has brought thee hither,
but let me advise thee in these Merchants affairs, to let things alone, till
either thou become a Sandwich-Brewer, ot a Portsman at least, to know what it
is to be a good Townes-man at home where ever thou dwell, or till thou be a
Merchant thy self, that experience may tell thee what it is to seek Marts and
Markets abroad, and then I doubt not, but as others do, thou will be glad of a
good peny-worth of that which being thine, to dispose of is already thine own.
The entertainment given by a Lord Treasurer, to an Informer, against a
Customer of Sandwich.
And so being dismissed, he was wild first into the Seller, but from thence out
of doors.

Such was the regard in those days that was had of Whisperers, though now it
be holden for best service to the State, to talk most of Errors, and diue
deepest into Customs, but many speak of ROBIN-HOOD that never drew his BOW.

And although the Farming of some few particulars that were let out already,
might seem but a mischief of lesser harm; yet harm more or less, toward
Sovereigns and Subjects make no Man happy, and therefore to be shund: but to
Farm out all, was a public inconvenience, so great in my conceit, as might
worthily deserve the wisest prevention, which made me give warning according to
my place.

For if Traffic be truly called the Nurce of Justice, wherein Sovereigns and
Subjects stand interest alike: so natural is the Union of Religion with
Justice, that the Farming out of Subsidies (effects of Traffic) together with
the Customs, or guilding them over with the Golden Name of Customs, may
fitly be resembled to the impropriating of religious offerings, by the Name of
Tithes. The one due to none but to heavenly Deity. The other also only, to
Sovereign Princes. The one, a wrong to GOD, a stop to Religion, and a
beggering of the Church; The other, a dishonouring of Kings, a rub to
Trifficke. and a means to impouerish Kingdoms, and disturb Commonweals.
Howsoever, some few private, particular preventing Persons, perhaps may raise
themselves, and by chance may thrive thereby.

But to make all this more plain. If the Subsidies aforesaid, upon Lands and
Goods, were urged to be collected; as Cardinal Woolsey once thought to prove
upon the Clergy, or exposed out to Farmers by Hundreds, Lathes, or Shires, or
generally undertaken, as Tonnage and Pondage is, who should collect it? Read
Hall and Stow in Hen. 8. 1526.
Or who were able to abide it? Yet for comparing these two together, and
fore-warning mischiefs at hand and to come, by the farming out of either; like
the simple Satyr, that seeing the Sky-stolne fire from the Wheels of this
Chariot, admiring it in love, and but kissing it in kindness, found it burnt
his lips, CASTOR misinformed, and POLLAX being offended; I was graciously
chidden and shent for my labor: such is the lot of Customers in this lower
kind of Traffic and worldly Commerce, that in their best endeavors have no hap
to be happy, but in heaven I hope for better. Non est mortale quod opto.

Thus far forth, and in these very words, or to this effect at least, having
sometimes undertaken a private Defense in a Cause of importance, both public
and general, and finding all my groans and heauiest complaints, to vanish
still like Echoes, and valued but as voices in the Deserts and Plains, next
the FOREST OF SHIFTS, the sound whereof as most Men went by, they heard not;
some heard, but understood not; some few perhaps understand, but regard not,
and none seemed to pity. Like those that broken with unthankful toil, Seek
others health and happiness, and loose their own the while; I began to sigh,
and wish withal besides, Si ie pouuoys renaistre,
Et changer tous mes voeux,
IN apprendroys meulx ma letre
Et serois bien-heureux.


But being as I was, I resolved with my self, as a Barn so ding'd, that I
durst no longer greet, to give way to the times, and sup up my grief with
silence.

Notwithstanding, when I perceived, that though I sat still, the cause it self
daily did grow worse and worse; And remembered withal, my vow to my Sovereign
and PATRON, Customers are sworn at their first admissions, to do their best
endeavors, to deal justly between the Prince and the People.
of our Schools at my first admission; in discharge of my Duty, which in that
respect I owe to God, to my Prince, and Native Country: I once more resolved to
speak with my Pen, and examine all my former Writings. Not as by way of
Genesis, to prescribe a new Art to our Wise and Grave Masters, for that had
been presumption in the highest degree, nor as by Analisis to contest with the
Method of our seuerest Hushers, for that had been but humor and indiscretion,
but whilst others of higher Forms, and far better Learning, distrusting
their Schools, remoou'd their Seats to a far surer standing; as a poor
Sholler, desirous to learn and thrive by my Book, to spell out my Lessons, by
the Letters of mine ALPHABET, and Lines of my PRYMER, that so at leastwise
redeeming but the time, I might best give way to the stream of Disgraces, in
hope of better days in coming. Remembering still withal, that Errors had no
being but in absence of Truth, and that howsoever Errors past had multiplyde
themselves, the ages succeeding must reform as they may, and that as there was
a reason, so GOD had appointed a time for all things. For Dies dat consilium.

Considering therefore the Reuolutions that were past, The Motive and occasion
of the ALPHABET and PRIMER.
and the present disposition of these happy days, by the coming of AEGEVS in
our late ISIS place. KING and PRINCE.
Our DAY STAR being risen, and the DAVVNING in our eyes received my dull
Spirits, gave life to my hopes, and made me at last breath thus much and say,
that the time may come, when this hearty zeal of mine to my Sovereigns
Honor, and his Peoples happiness might be better regarded, and the ages to
come find something at least, to muse and to marvel at Ignorances past, when
it should plainly appear, by demonstratiue Reasons, and no wandering
Discourse, that in poor Customers, Truth was never Error, nor Virtue Vice, as
the World had been told, and long borne in hand; for can they but see, they
shall learn to spell, and by spelling their Letters, both read and understand
(besides Greater Matters) that Publicans and Sinners are several words, and
implye a distinction both of Manners and Men. And were it, or might it be, that
docible persons might be suffered but to learn, Publicans both could and would
teach Sinners to be like unto themselves, not Saints, nor Hypocrites, but
humble-minded Christians, and plain dealing Men.

The Method and Style of the Customers ALPHABET and PRIMER.
Thus settling my self to mine Alphabet again, thereby to spell my Primer. In
my beginning praying God to be my speed, I felt his Grace and his Goodness
did help me to proceed. For opening but my Book, I found how great A. and
little A. A.
Per se, and by themselves, like the Creator and Creature, or the Maker and
Model showing Deity and Humanity did stand for GOD and MAN, A. GOD. MAN.
and joined both together, did make but One Medium, in the person of JESUS
CHRIST, to perfect al our happiness, both in Heaven and Earth. For as the
Godhead of the Father, and the Godhead of the Son, with the Godhead of the
Spirit, did make but one Essence in the substance of the Deity; and GOD and MAN
united to the Person of JESUS CHRIST, did make but one Savior in the substance
of Humanity, so Christ and his Church, by the Union of the Spirit, did make but
one Body. To save and find out Man, when covetous presumption by Pride had so
sedu'st Him in his least part of trust, that he lost both him and his.

A Miracle of Miracles, and Mystery to muse on, but by no means to express,
as whereby the greatest looser has made the greatest gain.

Here therefore I staid a while, and set my self to wonder: For as the Motive
of this Model, was the Makers only will, the Medium his own word, the way
his own wisdom, and the measure Aequum and Bonum, bounds of his own
Goodness by Pre-eminence of Justice: so the absolute perfection and End of all
his work, was his own affection and desire to preserve by Prerogative of his
own first love and boundless Mercy, that the Creature might have justly
wherein to admire both his Creators infinite Honor, and his own eternal
happiness.

Now by this, it was apparent to common sense and reason, that what Nature can
afford, or Man being thus restord is able to possess, is Gods own
Free-guift, even from the beginning: that as a Lord per amount, his Honor and
Service might justly be known two several ways to all his Free-Tenants;
namely, by his own special Duties, and peculiar Rights, and their thankful
acknowledgements of their easy Rentes in so rich a Free-farme, by the Titles
of their Tenures. The Titles of whose Tenures, being Religion and Justice: The
one, to maintain his personal Rights, and demonstrate his Honor. The other,
motions of affection, and reciproke Love, to show and set forth Loyalty for the
Tennants mutual good.

The Laws, Customs, and Doctrine whereof, pend by his Spirit, and drawn from
the Essence of his own heavenly Deity being so concurrent, that where both of
them are not, there can be neither: I chose heerewithall, comparatively to use
in this my present Lesson, as well to sanctify my Wit, and bliss mine
endeavors, as to illustrate each other. The Method used by the Customer, to
perfect this Account before God and the World, by joining Religion and Justice
together, to avoid Paradoxicall Replies and Cauils.


Now, by the Rules of Religion and Justice both, Qui per alium facit, per semet
ipsum facit: Even Gods immediate Rents, God himself expects daily to receive
at our hands; namely, Praise and Thanksgiving, such is our Tenure: for being
jealous of his Name, he will not have his Honor transferred to any other. The
rest he accepts of, being faithfully paid to his Stewards and Lieutenants;
namely, Tithes and Tributes. In which regard, I saw how we stood bound, to
reverence and respect the transcendent aspectes of MAJESTY and SOVEREIGNTY,
even in earthly sublimities, by their Attributes and Tributes, as Gods among
Men. For the Attributes of Power in heavenly Deity, being Justice and Mercy,
in regard of Truth and Goodness: The Attributes of Greatness in earthly
Humanity, in regard of Truth and Bounty, are PRE-EMINENCE and PREROGATIVE, the
two sacred Titles of MAJESTY and SOVERAIGNETY, in the height of all Sublimitie:
The one, to show the Dignity both of Persons and Places; the other, transcendes
to the motions of their Minds.

Thus far Grace and Goodness did guide my Devotion through deep
contemplations, till holding up my head, and casting mine eyes to seek about
for Tributes, mine own ENTHVSIASME beginning to awake, so quickened all my
senses, and withal, vntyde my tongue, that my Vowels made me speak a. e. i. o.
and u. and by their several sounds, to gather and discern the use of all my
Letters, dividing them as Consonants into Semivowels, Mutes, and Liquides, with
and Per se and Conper se, and Title Title, est Amen.

By these I came to learn (to my secret comfort and private consolation) how
our Customs great and small out of mere Necessity to supply the want of
Nature by Artificial Mines, both in Matter, Places, Persons, Order, and Ends,
should be speld by themselves, for the Demonstration of MAJESTY in the
furnishing of BVLLION. And how our foresaid Subsidies of Tonnage and Pondage,
out of Loves reciprocation, and Loyalties own affection, were frankely
presented for the safeguard of the Seas, and protection of Merchants in their
Goods or Livings, in their Liberties, in their Lives, in their Honors, and in
the Peace and Union of our Land; stood likewise by themselves. Whereby I
plainly saw, and did show it unto others for the general good of Subjects,
both how MAJESTY might be seen, and how SOVERIGNTY might subsist, as by
peculiar Attributes, so by Tributes of their own; namely, Customs and
Subsidies, but cheefely Customs.

Two words of Foreign birth I could not understand, for their Heteroclyte use
and conuertible sounds, Imposts, and Impositions, which being but the Genus to
those former two, and held for a Species of some other Duty, in my weak conceit
have deceived many.

For Customs Original, being those Duties artificial that our Kings must
needs have, and Necessity imposes on all that transport by our
Staple-Commerce, to supply our wants of Bullion.

And Subsidies collateral, those natural Respects that Merchants frankely
offer, and willingly impose and lay upon themselves, for protection of the
Seas, and free Traffic besides: beyond the bounds of Necessity and Free will,
I know not what Nature has to read, or Art to spell.

Besides, whereas MAJESTY must, may, and can but be seen, and SOVEREIGNTY
subsist, as in GOD so in KINGS; look what Adoration and Tithes are to GOD, the
same are Customs and Subsidies to his Lieutenants: and beyond the bounds that
Wisdom has laid out for the practice of Truth, Discretion may hunt, but
shall find naught but Errors, for as Omne nimium vertitur in vitium, and Omne
minimum is inimica Naturae: so what exceedes or is less, is but Popery or
Preciseness, to disorder the Church, and disturb Commonweals.

Yet I wot not well how, though enough make the Feast, and abuses mar all,
the World being bewitched with two kinds of Imposts and strange Impositions; as
Aliquid Boni propter vicinum Bonum, so Aliquid Mali propter vicinum Malum: our
Neighbors sower Grapes have set our teeth on edge, for by their Examples
drawn (as they term it) from Sovereign Prerogative, but would say
Pre-eminence if they understood themselves; Impositions are made Taxes upon
Merchandise, by mere Discretion, besides the Duties aforesaid, which wanting
Place and Use in the study and Schools of Customs, Hoc autem de quo nunc
agimus, illud ipsum est quod VTILE appellatur; in quo verbo lapsa consuetudo
deflexit de via, coque sensim deducta est, vt Honestat^m ab Vtilitate
secerneus: HONESTVM aliquid constituerit quod uon sit VTILE, and VTILE quod non
sit HONESTVM qua, nulla pernicies mayor vitae Hominum potuit asserri. Cicero
offic. Lib. 2.
have likewise no part in the Honor and Ends there taught and propounded,
where VTILE is most dangerous, if it either go alone or follow not HONESTVM.

For being but effects of conceited private Proiects, upon unknown or obscure
Causes, of Matter uncertain, and of Form no ways fitting the Mowld of
Free-Commerce; all Men refuse to have to do (if it may be) with them; to argue,
to define, to divide, or to bring them once in question. The rather for that
being naturally irreguler and letigious, they have been occasions of much
unrest, disunion, and disorder, by means of Popery in former times, till Magna
Charta compounded such greefes. And albeit the use of them since, might happily
aim at the beating back of some Foreign idle Commodities, brought in upon
us, and obtruded by Strangers, to the hindrance of our Trades, and decay of our
Ports, both in Mariners and Shipping, which the wisdom of our State must seek
to maintain; yet gathering withal upon the natural Freeborn Subjects,
they repine thereat, as men willing to obey, but not able to discern between
the dispositions of States and changings of Times, and so is a special
occasion of many Disorders. The Subject still appealing to the Positive Laws
of our own Free- Traffic, as a general Inheritance; and Strangers urging
their Treatise and mutual Contracts.

These Imposts of Discretion, or strained Pre-eminence, have likewise begotten
some other Impositions of baser Nature, and more dangerous Effects, whereby
that sacred word of Wisdom, Bounty, Mildness, and Mercy (SOVEREIGN
PREROGATIVE) becomes irreverently prostituted, and many ways profaned: For
whereas SOVEREIGNS are sometimes pleased (as well may beseem them) out of
mere Grace and Favor in public Restraints, by special leave and licenses,
to make some of their Servants more happy then their Fellows; the same by sales
and transactions, transmuted and transferred, is a means to make Subjects from
hand to hand, to rack and impose even upon and among themselves, whereby
Subjects worrying Subjects, Licentijs sumus omnes deteriore^
and devouring one another, by means of such Imposts wax rich in an instant,
as Ravens fat by Carrion; When indeed and in truth, the Grace does loose her
Being, and the Grant becomes void upon the first Exchange. For if Favorites
get suits of Licenses or Farms unfit for their callings, Wine, Beer, (...)
etc. And whatsoever of this kind bestowed by way of Licenses, or other gracious
favor is afterward transferd, sold, or put over from the first recieuer, to a
second and third hand for Money. Simones Magi. Acts Cap. 8. verse 20.
or use them not themselves, it is but Witchcraft and Sorcery that all such
entend, as by Leases or Purchase for private gain, think SOVEREIGNS
PREROGATIVES either vendible for Money, or subject to Exchange. Such Impost
Masters, Religion has accursed, their Money and themselves therefore (without
hearty repentance) must perish both together.

These Imposts or Impositions, term them how you list, as they are but Romish
Peter Pence, and Italian Inventions, where their Princes Pre-eminence and
for'st kind of Dignities have little other Subsistence, being but either
borrowed or obtruded upon us; I past them slightly over, and so sent them home
again, for England being no ways obnoxious to Italy, nor Vassal to Rome,
has, or else may have (being rightly used) enough of her own.

For our Vowels and our Consonants agree so well together, that spelling all by
Union, and ending all in Peace, they perfect all our Alphabet without the help
of others, though the placing of some CAPITALS in the world elsewhere abroad,
by their lewd and ill examples, be a cause of some unrest. Whose Pride, profane
Presumption, and Couetise besides, by Equiuocating sounds makes words be so
misconstrued, that MAJESTY seems ecclip'st, and like to be out fa'st.

For R. P. that with honest ancient Romans, was read for Respublica, is now
Respriuata: And P. P. for Principes or Pater Patriae, now either by themselves,
or pla'st before A. in the stead and Rome of M. makes P AP A (sometimes Pater)
stand and strive for MAJESTY before GOD and KINGS. And C. crept up to K. makes
Cardinals challenge Kings without Crowns to be known by, or Kingdoms of
their own; so that as P AP A now spells ANTICHRIST, so Cardinals ANTI-KINGS.
Whereby S. P. Q. R.
sometimes the Arms and Honor of Rome, for Senatus Populus Que Romanus, may
now as well be read, Stultus Populus Querit Romam, to the great disgrace of
Catholics, both in Church and Commonwealth.

But those two great words of Power, PRE-EMINENCE and PREROGATIVE, beginning
both with P. did most of all perplex me. For seeing Justice and Mercy in the
height of al sublimitie, attending heavenly MAJESTY so reverently together, and
the same in earthly Attributes contesting each with other, I knew not how to
spell them. For though they both contained the very selfsame Letters that
mine Alphabet did teach, yet the first importing Justice I durst not look upon
for the sternnesse of her face and settled Severity; and the second full of
Mercy, I could not but admire for her mild aspect and infinite Serenity. In
the first I could discern but two of our Vowels, e. and i. for Persons and
Place, but the second had them all, a. e. i. o. and u. I mean u. and v. Sirs,
and v. my Lords, w. and all. The one of greatest Power, yet bounded in her
Greatness. KING and PRINCE. Counsel, and Commonwealth.
The other, a very Hieroglifique, above my reach and reason: yet hearing still
withal, how at all hands and daily, PRE-EMINENCE for PREROGATIVE, and
PREROGATIVE for PRE-EMINENCE, were strangely speld together; I appeald unto the
Wisest in highest Authority, to compound the distractions that the World was
subject to, by the misunderstanding of words of such importance, as both for
Matter, Persons, Place, Order, and End; The important necessity of observing
precisely, the distinct use and Ends of Pre-eminence and Prerogative, in all
words and Actions.
so nearly concerned all our Livings, all our Lives, all our Liberties, all our
Honors, and all the Peace of our Land united so together. And let all men in
Gods Name that have eyes to see, will to learn, or wit to understand, spell
and distinguish the value of the Consonants, and compass of the Vowels these
two words contain, for they show the difference and distinction between
Sovereignty and Subjection, and the height of Dignity, both of Deity and
Humanity, the very right of GOD and KINGS.

Here (I say) is work indeed for Wisdom to consider, and Power to
reconcile, both these two Attributes and words of like import. For by their
Example, as the Mass would seem the Eucharist, and Usury is called Exchange; so
our Customs stand for Subsidies, Subsidies for Impositions, and Imposts now
equivocate both our Customs and Subsidies.

This is the fruit of Trauailers by wandering still to Rome, England and
Customers il beholden to such as travailing for Experience, think the
Impositions of Italy a fit president for Policy or Government when they come
home

That hunting for experience, ride early and late:
To make the Imposts of Italy as soon as they come home,
A President of Government, as fit to guide our State.
Whereby as Majesty stands eclip'st, so Customers in disgrace are in nothing
yet more wretchedlike then in their Names and Place, for being borne happy,
bred happy, and loosing themselves in seeking happiness for others, themselves
cannot be happy.

But if Delicta sequnter Personas, and greatest offenses deserve greatest
punishments; that mine own Faith to Godward, and obedience to my SOVEREIGN,
declaring my Religion and civil conversation, may warrant mine Account both
before GOD and KINGS: Having thus far speld and read by the help of Grace and
Goodness, I proceeded to my Creed, and then my Ten-Commaundements, By the
Customers Belief* note the true Religion taught and defended in
Great-Brittaine.
whereby being taught to Cipher, I came at last by telling, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
7. 8. 9. 10. to set down my Receipts, and to clear up all my Reckonings,
without suspending any, or enstaulement of a Penny. For being to cast Accounts
for my self and for others, ( Customers are Accomptants, even for the sins
of others) I found that twelve Articles, two Mysteries and ten great
Commaundes, The sum of true Religion, consisting of twelve Articles, two
Sacraments, and Ten Commandments, contains all Christian Duties, both to God
and Kings.
made the sum of mine Alphabet just four and twenty Letters; namely, a. e.
i. o. u. and b c. d. f. g. h. k. l. m. n. p. q. r. s. t. w. x. y. z. And the
number of all numbers, The compass and number of the Alphabet, consisting of
24. Letters, comprehend and teach all Religion and Justice.
where perfection is confined both of Heaven Earth, [Ten.] Three being Gods own
number and perfection of Deity; as GOD the Father, GOD the Son, and GOD the
Holy Ghost: and seven of Humanity, in our first and free Election, Creation,
Redemption, Vocation, Justification, Sanctification, and Glorification, by the
means of CHRIST JESUS, that is both GOD and MAN. By this likewise I speld our
own Ten Courts of Justice, By the ten Sovereign Courts of fundamental
Justice, are pointed at and meant the Ten Commandments. The Customers Grace.
His Prayers.
the perfection whereof distributiuely, makes us al so happy, and for which, as
Grace made me say Grace, and give God hearty thanks, so Goodness bad me pray
for the blessed State and happiness of my SOVEREIGN, first by Name King
JAMES, and for his Privy COUNCIL, for his ISIS, for the Prince, and all the
Royal Issue, for the CLERGY, for the NOBLES, and COMMONS of the Land. In a
word, for the Church and Commonwealth: And for Traffic at the last, though
my Faith seemd frail, and my credit almost gone, yet not to despair; but by
conning still my Creed, and those very Ten Commandments mine Alphabet does
teach, to remember but mine Oath, and do my best Endeavor, and hope withal
That Vnus Homo Nobis cunctando restituet Rem.

So closing up mine Alphabet with a public confession and with a daily
Prayer, for and Per se, and Con per se, and all the rest together; I
prostrately presented and encluded a Petition to the KING our sacred
SOVEREIGN, for his Son the Princes sake, in the Name of all the Customers of
the Out-Ports of this Land, to be read at his best leisure; within those
sanctified words, and effectual form of Prayer, which the Son GOD of
himself commanded and taught, that as his is the KINGDOM, the POWER, and the
GLORY, for ever and ever, So be it, Amen. So our Sovereigns treble Title, with
Est and Amen, might perfect all our happiness: saying lastly for my self; Nil
sum, nulla miser noui solatia, Massam
Humanam nisi quod tu quoque CHRIST geris:
Tu me sustenta, fragilem tu CHRIST guberna,
Fac vt sim Massae surculus Ipse tuae.
I nothing am, and in my self no comfort find but this,
That CHBISY the Mass of humane flesh has taken and joined to his:
Then save me CHRIST and grant withal, that this frail flesh of mine,
A twig at least, may bud and branch from that great Mass of thine.
And Magna, Magnus perficit DEVS.


Now, that I seem not thus by spellinge to Cabalize in jest, or think to
construe Hieroglifiques by Common sense and reason; Having found by mine
Alphabet, those Consonants of Letters wherewith the very Wisdom of the Bible
is expressed, and hearing by my Vowels the same sound of Goodness, the New
Testament does teach; and the very selfsame Truth (for Doctrine at the least,
let personal defects still answer for themselves) that CHRIST and his
APOSTLES, yea, S. PETER with the rest did leave unto the World, for Sovereigns
to protect, and Subjects to obey: If Religion and Justice may be held
sufficient to help us to happiness, what Kingdom in the world, nay, what City,
Port, or Town, either public or private, for Temples and Courts, and
Free-Schooles besides, may compare with GREAT-BRITTAINE? where for Matter,
Places, Persons, Order, and Ends, all Learning now Tryumphes, and AL-BOVNTY
commands. For our Reverend Bishops and Learned Divines, work obedience in
Subjects by the rules of conscience, and both by life and Doctrine, directing
the way how to win Heaven, teach Faith and Good-workes, and Preach in all our
Churches, that Faith only and alone in the Action of saving, is the cause of
Salvation, in regard of the freedom of sanctifying Grace; but in the Party
saved, both must concur together, to justify the calling; (And not as those
Cardinals do, and Destructive Jesuits, that to build up their Popery, would
blow up Commonweals, and by looseness of Life and Traditions of Men, being
Subjects themselves, contemn their own Sovereigns, kill sacred Kings,
contest with Gods anointed, and rob CHRIST of his honor. Nor as these
Distractiue Teachers would do, that preposterously propounding such fancies of
Perfection, as no Reason can reach to, nor themselves express; prefer
Sacrifice before obedience, and obtrude upon GOD more then he requires)
assuring us withal out of warrant from the WORD, that to all whom his SPIRIT
makes truly repentant, GOD by JESUS CHRIST, both is, and will be, a most
gracious and a most loving GOD, but GOD without CHRIST, is a consuming Fire.
And our Worthy-Graue Judges sit upright in all our Courts of fundamental
Justice, and both by Law and Conscience, maintain the perpetuities of all our
Lands and Goods, by the Name of Livings, all our Liberties, all our Lives, all
our Honor, and the Peace of all our Land distributiuely; discerning and
decyding by Meum and Tuum as well in Tithes as in Tributes, the Cases and
Questions of special Right and general Reason, as well between 1. 1 The Court
of COMMON PLEAS, and Staples.

And our learned Ciuilians so belay the public Peace of our 7. 7 The Court of

GREENE-CLOTH.
where Acco^ptants are heard, discharged, and dispacht by Court-Rowles, and
Court-Rules, grounded on Presidents, of Wisdoms own Examples, without
partial respects, or private Discretion.

Now, if it be a happiness for men to have the freedom to come to such
Churches, to frequent such Temples, and to dwell within Houses, whose
Foundations are laid on such assured grounds; what reason have Catholics (if
they be not bewitched) to fly from their Country, or be wedded so to Rome? For
Customers want words to express their inward joys, and show their best
conceits, of the blessings of God in these our days and times, for the stays
of Religion, and Distributive Justice; only our Court of CHEVALRY wants but her
Judges to decide points of Honor, and prevent thereby our Cumbats, and our
Traffic wants her Staples: for were those two 1. 1 The High Conestable and
Earl Mareschall of England.
Patrones of Honor, 2 The Heralds.
on whom 2 Mercury should serve by APOLLO but found out; and the Roofes of our
Schools made but Winde-tight and Water-tight, in the breaches and wants of
Commutatiue Right, and had Traffic but her Staples, as Religion has her
Temples, we would soon make Verses in praise and commendation of our Prelates
and our Nobles, of our Prince and our Peers, and sing all Alleluiah to the
great KING of Heaven. Aux Chicanneurs l'honneur n'ha point de lieu* Car sans
argent vous parlez en Hebrieu.


But this part of Justice being most out of frame, and disturbing all the rest
Commutatiuely, keeps down our voices, which now falling out, and fitted for
my Lesson, I must by my Letters go spell out the words that belong to the
Titles of my Sovereigns Tributes. Wherein being thus far proceeded, by the
help of Grace and Goodness, and Religion with Justice, being both on my side:
I resolved by the Medium, to dig on and delue for Truth, the Foundation of
Felicity, and so become happy. For since the Ox is not muzled that treads out
the Corn, by the Rules of Religion, and Justice allows to each labourer his
hire: I saw no right nor reason, why serving at the Altar, I might not hope at
least, at last to live thereby, though I held my peace: For Assai demanda encor
che may non grida chi ben seruendo tace. And why treading out the path of
happiness for others I should be put by. Therefore having now learnde all my
Letters, and CHRIST'S Cross being my speed, and the Holy Ghost, lowly setting
forward, I thus began to fly.

Habet and Musca splenem and formicae sua bilis inest: The PRIMER.
Yet far be it from Customers to value themselves by way of revenge, or
disgracing of others. But since al men even by Nature desire to be happy, by
the rules of Right and Reason, and Religion bids Reason have an eye still to
Nature, and be next her self: of all worldly happiness, if the meanest be but
Wealth, and reputation cheifest, Honor being held a recompense for all our
loss besides. If all quit their Livings, for their Liberties to work, (Nature
gives no privilege for any to be idle;) If all forgo their Liberties for the
purchase of their Lives; If Livings, Liberties, Lives, and All seem nothing to
our Credits. And if GOD so prise his holy Name, that he is Ielous of his Glory,
to show how his LIEVTENANTS should be curious of their Honor, I came at last
to see, and therewithal to wonder, that the Names even of KINGS, GODS
immediate Lieutenants, nay, of GOD himself through Ignorance and her Fellows,
are subject to disgrace as well as Customers.

But as Quaedam sunt and non videntur, and Quaedam videntur and non sunt
omnino. So Plus quandoque valet in Rebus promouendes, opinio Ignorantium quam
Rei veritat. Which made me to consider, that though Piety and Equity were the
Arts of Felicity; yet as every Text had his Gloss, and every Art her Mystery;
so Religion being the Rule for Apprentises of Piety, to learn the way to
Glory, showed the Eucharist for Mystery. And the settled Art of Equity, that
raises all to Honor by the rules of honest Justice, for her Mystery had
Exchange.

The first being wholly heavenly, and fastened to Divinity, is taught by
Divines, and I am but a Customer, yet a faithful Christian Catholic, and a
Loyal Kentish Man. But the other from Humanity, more fit for sense and reason,
with dim eyes and trembling hands, to show the best endeavor of a feeble wit
and weaker brains, I gave my self to spell, and directly to discover.

An Argument I confess of a higher pitch, and far greater compass, then I
did or could imagine, when I took it first in hand: wherein hazard even at
first did very much discourage me, in respect of the times. In the midst, by
Friends I was many ways dissuaded in regard of the pains, and I had given it
over (for I wrought all alone) but for the Enthusiasme and Spirit of Adoption
still sounding in mine ears, Religion takes thy part, and Justice on thy side:
Ton Ame ne doibt ta flamme estant divine,
Rien aim ny seruir si'l n'est egual aux Dieux.
Thy Soul is so beset by Vows that are Divine,
Thou shall not tread amiss, let not thy heart decline.


By whose persuasion, when I had but once begone, my conscience thrust me
forward, and thus preuaild at last: Ie veulx quun bell ozer honor ma ruin,
Et si'l fault que Ie tomb Ie l'ay voulu des cieulx.
Then danger stand aside (quoth I) since Goodness calls me to it, If ought do
put me by, it is Wisdoms hand shall do it.

My stays besides were these: As Goodness called me forward, so Truth was
still my Ground, which as Time did suggest, Experience still supplide: My Pen
Oportet made, and was ever apt to mend, (being sworn to do my best) Order
gave the Form, but the Style I still suspected, and saw some cause to doubt,
till Prayer in conclusion, undertook to perfect or persuade the best; so that
if the Phrase for the plainness, might pass without offense, I was sure the
Matter for importance, might deserve a double and treble reading. Now the
Matter indeed was Traffic, I mean our own Freeborn Traffic that honest
Nurce of Justice, that so kindly feeds us all, and handled Ab effectis,
contains those selfsame Customs for which the poor Scholars in the
Out-Schooles of Tributes, have so long time bin subject to bayting and beating,
and for which my self was so graciously chidden.

Thus searching after Truth, that only of it self makes all in all happy,
though it be my hard fortune to work still alone; Quo fato nescio sed non sine
Numine: As my hope and comfort is, yet following still mine ALPHABET, and Lines
of my PRYMER, I came at last to spell those very ACROAMATA of Piety and Equity,
The Motive and occasion of the ACROAMATA.
so fitly joined together, by Religion and Justice, that leads all to Truth,
and so to Happiness, as made me read out plainly, and write distinctly thus.

The Method and Style of the ACROAMATA.
All Men by Nature are desirous to be Happy, as well as Customers, and aim at
Perfection by rules of Order, and degrees of Goodness. But Ignorance being
every way the Mother of Errors, and Grandame of Mischeefes, begotte with all
those Inconveniences, which pretend indeed Order, but lead all to Discord,
Disorder, and Confusion. Is ought then out of Order, and fit to be reformed?
Consult but with Wisdom and we need not despair. For Priuatio semper
presupponit habitum: Sickness it self shows a habit first of Health, and the
disproportioned Disposition of any Function, high or low, does argue an
Intention and possibility of Order. Nay, Ignorance her self knows and tells it
all over, that ERRORS have no Being but in absence of Truth, and unawares to
her self does teach Reformation how in seeking after Truth the best rule of
Order, in finding her to wander is still to look backward: for even out of
Confusion, Perfection may be drawn as Truth, by the Causes of Truth, comes
once to be known; so by this I perceived, Foelix qui poterit Rerum cognoscere
Causas.

Now GOODNESS, TRVTH and WISDOM, make but one Essence, and being ever linkt
together, I found that GOD himself was both All and either, and therefore
All-sufficient, and only All in All, which first made me bold and thus to
read out: AB JOVE PRINCIPIVM.

For all things in the World (God alone excepted) affecting to be happy,
besides the inclination, they have in themselves (for use or knowledge) draw
helps from others to external perfection; and whatsoever they seem to
acquire, the same they term always positiuely their Good, but that wherein
perfections self does rest, their Summum Bonum, or Soueraign bliss. For of
things that are called but simply Good, and sought but for themselves, some are
as Instruments to direct and help us to the End of our desires, of which sort
are Riches: others also we wish for in regard of themselves; as Health,
Wisdom, Honor; yet not being the mark that we gladly would hit, our
Desires still proceed. Thus we are first borne to labor, we labor to eat,
we eat still to live, and we live to do good by some calling or other, in the
Church or Commonwealth. Wherein all we do or can do, even our best endeavors
are but as seed sown with a reference, and respect to some further future
Harvest; so that still we proceed till we come to a pawse, whereat we needs
must rest.

There are likewise some things desired but only for themselves, because the
Desirers imperfection can affect them no further, as Cattle do their food.
But that which Man seeks for with referencc always to a further End, that he
still desires with a Means and Measure, every way convenient and fitted to
that End, and to the Good he affects only as Good within it self, his desire
is infinite: so that unless that Good be likewise infinite in it self, he
erres in his choice, and mistakes his End, as they that seeking Happiness,
place their Summum Bonum in popular applaud, worldly Wealth or Pleasure. Omnis
Forma Boni infunditur secundum meritum Materiae.


But nothing can indeed be infinitely desird, save that Good which in it self
is every way infinite, for the better any Good is, the more to be desird, and
that alone most desird, wherein there is abiding an infinity of Goodness: Bonum
quo Communius eo semper melius.
so that where any thing desird has an infinity of Being, or is infinite in
it self, that, of all Things that can Be, is of all Beings to be most of all
desired; But nothing Is or can Be infinitely Good save GOD. He therefore Man's
highest happiness, Summum Bonum and perfect Bliss. DEVS Tantum Infinite Bonus
ergo summum Bonum.


Now Desire tends to Union with the Good which is desired, for bare possession
makes no Man happy, but the use and fruition of Goodness being once obtained.
For Quo mihi Fortuna si non conceditur vti? Then Happiness thus speld, and the
words put together, I was taught to pronounce, to be that State of Life,
wherein we so enjoy Goodness in the height of all perfection, that though we
be but Men, yet we live, as it were the very life of GOD himself, Et Homo
Homini Deus.

Perfection then of Happiness residing still in Heaven, the Throne of our GOD,
and the Earth but his Footstool; his infinite Goodness drawing our Desires,
must help us up thither, by a kind of Free-Traffique between his fixed Seat
in Heaven, and wandering Church on Earth; his heavenly Inspirings downward, and
our holy Desires upward, being as Angels or Merchants between GOD and us. That
as his Doctrine does teach Him for our Supreme Truth, and our Prayers confess
Him for our Sovereign Good: so our Faith in him above belaying our Happiness,
our Charity below must work out our Salvation by a Medium, so convenient both
for Deity and Humanity, as fits both GOD and MAN, which can be no other then
JESUS CHRIST himself.

Faith I say (that works still by Love) apprehending the Mercies of GOD the
Father, for the Merits of GOD the Son, by the working of GOD the Spirit, the
Fountain of all Grace and Mother of Obedience. For great is the Mysterse that
belongs unto the Art of all our heavenly Happiness, (Godliness, or Piety) by
Goodness and Truth in the Doctrine of Religion, the sum whereof is this. GOD
manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Men and Angels,
believed in the World, and received up to Glory resides in Heaven.

For lively Types whereof, and special remembrances, CHRIST JESUS Himself our
Medium GOD and MAN, before his departure and Asscention up to Heaven, to
prepare our Happiness, besides his Word and Promise, did leave unto his Church
his sanctified Elements, of Water, Bread, and Wine, to comfort both our Bodies,
and confirm our Souls and Minds, as in Mirrors to behold Him, and as by
Pledges to assure us of his coming again, to draw us up thither: Namely,
Baptism; and the Eucharist at his own last Supper.

Religion therefore as the Rule of Christian Piety, by the Doctrine of Truth,
must lay the first foundation and safest Direction to our Summum Bonum, and
heavenly Happiness.

Thus far poor Cuctomers being taught to spell and read, praising God with
all their hearts, do clearly pronounce and steadfastly believe, which shows
them to be Christians. If that which likewise follows approve them to be
honest, why should they not be happy as well as other Men?

Happiness in perfection, by that which has been speld, being that estate of
life, wherein we so enjoy the fullness of all Bliss, as though we be but Men,
yet we live as it were the very life of God himself: to live the life GOD, is
to live as in his presence, and see his glorious face in the Majesty of his
Truth, and Soueraignety of his Goodness. No perfect Happiness but by the
sight of MAJESTY, personally fixed
To see therefore sacred MAJESTY every way still fixed, and SOVEREIGNTY subsist,
is the only state of life that perfects all happiness, both in Heaven and Earth.
In the seeking whereof, for my self and for others, as Piety directed my
Desire up to Heaven, Primum querite Reg number Dei, Deinde Meum and Tuum.
by the Rules of true Religion; so from Piety to Equity by the Rules of Meum
and Tuum, to see how MAJESTY stood fixed, and how SOVEREIGNTY might subsist as
well on Earth as in Heaven, Magnifica MAIESTATIS descriptio.
Justice to encourage me held up my Book, and bad me be bold, saying, honest
Man speak out; whereupon I thus set forward. Post Chaos, vt primum data sunt
tria Corpora Mundo,
Inque nouas species, omne recessit opus:
Pondere terra suo subsedit, and aequora traxit:
Ad-Coelum leuitas in loca summa tulit.
Sol quoquc cum stellis, nulla grauitate retentus,
Et vos Lunares exiluistis equi.
Sed neque Terra diu Coelo, neque caetera Phaebo
Sydera cedebant, par erat omnis Honor.
Saepe aliquis Solio, quod tu SATVRNE tenebas,
Ausus de media plebe sedere Deus.
Et latus Occano quisquam Deus aduena iunxit:
Thetis and extremo saepe recepta loco est.
Donec Honor, placidoque decens Reuerentia vultu
Corpora legitimis imposuere thoris.
Hinc sacra MAIESTAS, quae Mundum temperat omne^,
Quaque die partu est edita. Magna fuit.
Nec mora, consedit medio sublimis Olympo,
Aurea purpureo conspicienda sinu.
Consedere simul Pudor et Metus: omne videres
Numen ad HANC vultus composuisse suos.



As GOODNESS, TRVTH, and WISDOM, subsisting all together in the gloriousness
of Deity, made Man the first Model of Perfection like it self, for the use
and good of All, by the Rules of Religion: so Grace begetting Bounty in the
Nature of Humanity by Greatness and Decorum, fixed MAJESTY and SOVEREIGNTY in
the persons of some Men for all men's Weal, by the rules of Justice. Now in
following Justice rules, I light upon Equity, Equity spoke to Probity, Probity
speld out Honesty, Honesty brought forth Honor, and Honor fixed, showed me the
glorious Word of Reverence, and absolute power between Greatness and Decorum
(sacred MAJESTY) no where seen fixed but in GOD and KINGS. For as among all
the Attributes, and glorious Titles of Celestial Orders, recorded by Religion;
as Angels, Archangels, Virtues, Principalities, Dominions, Thrones, Seraphins,
and Cherubins, I could not spy out MAJESTY but infusiuely, save only in GOD
alone: so reading all the Titles, Orders, and Degrees of Goodness, that
Justice has set down, in Gentlemen, Squires, Knights, Baronets, Barons,
Vice-Countes, Earls, Marquesses, Dukes, Arch dukes, Princes, Vayvods, nor
Doges, nor Seruo Seruorum Dei; I could not see MAJESTY personally fixed save
only in Gods LIEVTENANTS by the Name of KINGS. No not in EMPERORS, but as they
were invested with the powerfulness of KINGS, which made me glad to see, and
thus to proceed.

As all things in Nature still tend to some End, and that as perfection of the
thing for which it works, is attained unto only by apt and fit means: so
that which moderates and forms out fitness, is termed Natures Law, by which
as by Rules, the World and all therein are distinguished and stinted: which
limitation also, both perfects and preserues all the things themselves. Measure
therefore that works by proportions is the means to Perfection. And since
nothing does perish but through too much or too little of that, the due
proportion whereof, does give Perfection; Measure, is also the preservation of
all things; for to proportions, Excess and Defects are opposite. Omne minimum
Inimica Naturae, and Omne Nimium vertitur in vitium.

Justice then the Rule, and in regard of Truth, the End presupposed in Equity,
for all honest Actions to guide themselves by, as Religion in Piety, for holy
Contemplations; is prescribed first by Laws, and preserved by Measures, which
being the charge of earthly Sovereigns, sets forth and limits their
Pre-eminence and Prerogative, qualities transcendent above their human
substance. For in regard of Justice, it is said they are Gods, though their
persons dye like Men. Now Justice being Commutatiue as well as Distributatiue,
the Commutatiue part includes our lower Traffic, to supply all necessities in
the use of those Good things that help to make us happy; either, by bartring
Good things for Good things, by the Name of Commodities, or by some Medium and
means, certain and indifferent to prevent advantage. The End then of Justice,
in regard of Truth in Actions, being Equity in Contracts, and Equality of worth
in Wares, and the only use Exchange, the Medium is by consent of Nations called
Money.

And as Truth and Goodness in all kind of Measures, being Standarts and
Beams for general Justice, like Vrim and Thummim are only Sovereigns
charge; to give thereby both weight and content, with length and breadth to all
proportions: so the Coining of Money, and valuation of it by their Powers and
Wisdoms, are essential Notes of their absolute Authority; so that putting
all together, seeing GOD to begin, and that KINGS were to follow, I read and
spoke out; Ab Jove Principium (REGES) Iouis omnia plena.

For if All things that are be so by GOD directed to several Ends, by sundry
means and distinct operations, neither violent nor casual, as falling out by
chance; his Goodness being the Fountain of all Happiness, and Piety the top
of all Moral Virtues. Let KINGS themselves, both think and thank GOD, and
do homage to Religion, by which all their Instruments become so justly fitted.
For if they that are Agents for Rule and Civil Government, or sit in high
places for the furtherance of Justice, think Policy a Trade fit for nothing
but gain; Formalities of Equity do but smother Right, and Commonweal
pretended, is turned to Common-Woe; making violence their Load stone,
Extremity their Compass, and Fortune the guide of all their best endeavors.
But as Nullum violentum can be Perpetuum, so Careat successibus opto Quisquis
ab euentu facta notanda putat. And so I concluded, Non temere ferimur (DEVS)
nec Nos Fortuna gubernat, sed vita and vitae Dux es and ipsa via.

Thus Religion and Justice being found the true Supporters and Fundamental
stays of all States and Kingdoms: I came at last to find out our Commerce;
for Iuctice being Commutatiue as well as Distributive; the Commutatiue part
encludeth Traffic, which subsisting of Goodness, and consisting of Truth, both
in Matter, Persons, Place, Order, and End; I speld and read thus*

Traffic is either a mutual Free-bartring of Meum for Tuum, or direct buying
and selling of vendible Wares by Merchants and Friends, according to the Rules
of Reciproke Commerce, generally entending the SOVEREIGNS Honor, and SVBIECTS
Wealth. Which dividing it self into Outward and Inward, of things bred at
home, or fet from abroad; three things there are, that by the Spirit of
Goodness, gives it three Degrees of Life, and thrice happy Beings. BONVM.


COMMODITIES, MONEY, EXCHANGE. The first (Cata-pautos) as the Mass or Matter
in the Body of Commerce, vpheld the World by Weight, The rule of Truth and
Goodness, by Weight in Quantity.
bartring Good things for Good things, (called Wares or Commodities) at the
Standart of Truth till Fraud came in.

The second, (Cat'autos) as the Blood or the Soul to quicken all the Body, a
Weight of Sovereign Worth, The Rule of Justice and Equity, by Weight and
Number, in Quantity and Quality.
to maintain Equity in Actions, and Equality in Wares, and distinguish Meum
and Meum, as well by Number as Weight at the Standart of Justice, made Good
things first vendible by the Name of Money.

The third, (Cat'holou proton) like the Spirit in the Soul, gives life to all
the Body at the Standart of Wisdom, The Rule of Wisdom and Order, by
Number, Weight, and Measure, in Quantity, Quality, and Use.
directing proportions of Good, Better, and Best, to Number, Weigh, and
Measure, the true worth and use of Goodness, for Quantity, Quality, and in
all vendible things, as well by Money, as in Money it self, by the Name of
Exchange.

The first, whilst Goodness and Truth made all things alike, Honestum.
knew not the Titles of Kings and Kingdoms, but magnified Honesty in the
Actions of Men.

The second, is that Means or right hand of Justice, Honor.
which Crowning KINGS, laid the first Foundation of PRE-EMINENCE and Dignity;
and fixed Honor and Reverence in the persons of Men, to show the Distinction
between SOVEREIGNS and SVBIECTS.

Majesty.
The third, by the Form shows us MAJESTY'S own Face between Greatness and
Decorum, and the absolute authority of Sovereigns over Subjects, by
transcendent PREROGATIVE of Mercy, Love, and Grace, that of Mortal Men makes
GODS on Earth.

Then putting all together, to show the sense and meaning, I speld and read out
thus.

By Goodness I meant that beautiful aspect, and beneficial influence of
Sovereign Beatitude, Sovereignty.
which the Grecians understand by the Calocagathia, sanctifying and assuring
the Material, Formal, and Final Ends of all Happy Beings efficientlie; for
Bono suo constant omnia.

By Commodities, I meant all Goodnesse-fixt, what, where, and howsoever, but
cheefely or Catexochen, and Instar omnium, the Elementall perfections of
Finenesse and Pureness, in Gold and Silver, Weight.
by the Name of Bullion; laid out by Nature at the Standart of Truth, to Weigh
the proportions of Good, Better, and Best, for extention of Goodness, and ease
of Commerce, for as Omne Bonum est sui diffusiuum, so quanto communius eo
semper melius.

By Money, I meant those figured proportions of Number joined with Weight,
Weight and Number.
laid out by Art at the Standart of Justice, for Meum and Tuum to measure
Goodness by in vendible things, through the natural perfection and worth of
it self: Vt quod vspiam nascitur Boni id apud omnes affluat: which none but
Kings may Coin, and Monarkes make current by their absolute powerfulness, and
powerful Pre-eminence, because Omne quod efficit Tale, id ipsum semper magis
Tale est and esse oportet.

And by Exchange, I meant that Rule of Order, in Wisdom, Policy, and
Government of State, which visibly demonstrates by Weight, Weight. Number.
Measure.
Number, and Measure, those honorable aspects of MAJESTY and SOVEREIGNTY, that
GOD from Heaven imparts to KINGS on Earth, within their own Dominions, by
their own stamps in Money materially, for the furtherance of Traffic in
vendible things. Traffic.
That as Goodness, diuinelie sublimate in all commodious things, becomes fixed
by consent in Gold and Silver, Bullion.
by the Name of Bullion. And Bullion only Coynd, receiving life in it self by
Sovereign Authority, becomes current withal, through all the members of
vendible Commerce, to show the Pre-eminence that Sovereigns have of Justice
above their Subjects by the means of Money: Money.
So Exchange ordering Proportions by Measures, more or less, Exchange.
to show the use of Goodness as well in all things by Coin, as in Coin it
self, sets forth the PREROGATIVE of their absolute Powers, Prudence,
Providence, Mildness, and Wisdom.

The use of Bullion being cheefely Money, Bullion.
to set forth SOVEREIGNTY, and show MAJESTY by, as it were face to face.

The use of Money, to make Meum and Tuum vendible, Money. Traffic. Honestum
Vtile. Order. Arts. Trades. Calling.

Ars Artiu^ (Moneta) or vera Ars regnandi. Moneta autem dicta quasi monens ne
quid fraudis, in Materia sign vel pondere fiat.


for the quick dispatch and ease of Traffiicke. And the Ends and Use of
Traffic the Sovereigns Honor, Subjects Wealth, and Kingdoms Peace, still
moving and disposing all Men's endeavors by willing courses, and perpetual
motions, in their several Arts, Trades, and Callings, to serve and work for
ONE: and that ONE made able to maintain the Synthesis and freedom of
Traffic, in serving all Men's turns by his Art of Coining Money, and Mystery
of Exchange.

Thus I set down as breefely as I could, how Traffic is the hand that lays
out all Men their work, prouides all men their food, and pays all Men their
Fees; and therefore ought at all hands to be seriously suppoorted that so
supports us all, and her willing Disturbers and witting Peruerters, held
enemies to Order; that is to say, to GOD and Nature.

But as out of Confusion Perfection first was drawn, when GOODNESS, TRVTH, and
WISDOM, by the Name of DEITY, consulting together, made MAN the first Model
of Perfection like it self, for the use of All in All; and GRACE begetting
BOVNTY by GREATNESS and DECORVM, fixed MAJESTY and SOVERAINGTY in the Persons of
some Men by the Name of KINGS, for all Subjects Weal; that Nature teaching
all Men how to seek Happiness, and aim at Perfection by the Rules of Order
and Degrees of Goodness: so the mingling or mistaking of things by speech or
writing, which GOD has distinguished and Nature divided, is the ground whereon
Ignorance by Discord and Disorder draws all to confusion, as before I breefely
touched, when I came to spell Customs, Subsidies, Impostes, and Impositions;
where I showed in their Collections, that Customs called Subsidies, and
Subsidies Impositions, and all put together seeming nothing else, but Customs
have brought Traffic to disorder, Customers to disgrace, and their Customs (I
may say) Almost to confusion.

But Almost was never hanged. Yet as a Customer sans Customs, since my
Credit's out of date, let Experience now tell Wisdom, if she come not all to
late; or if Quos DEVS perire vult, hos Ipse non occaecat; What Is become of
Customs? And I will out of other words, so prosecute Disorder, and the grounds
of all debate, that common sense shall see how Customers have reason to bemoane
themselves and others, before GOD and his LIEVTENANTS, and Traffiques poor
estate.

Namely, or Instar omnium, those highest Attributes of Sovereign Sublimity, by
Greatness and Decorum PRE-EMINENCE and PREROGATIVE, but cheefely and
Cat'exochen, those sacred Mysteries of heavenly and earthly Happiness, by
Godliness and Truth, the EVCHARIST and EXCHANGE. The first two mistaken and
confounded together, are both become abusd: the other two profaned by the MASS
and VSVRY. For, besides that mild and gracious word PREROGATIVE, and Attribute
of comfort, in whom al our five Vowels, a. e. i. o. u. that give life to our
Traffic, as well Downward as Upward by Goodness and Truth, in our first and
free Election, Creation, Redemption, Vocation, Justifying, Sanctifying, and
Glorifying at last; appear to be united and meet all together; and by whom
all our Mutes and Liquides are made to speak, and sound the daily preservation
of our Livings, Liberties, Lives, Honor, and Union of our Land, being taken
and abusd for stern PRE-EMINENCE, with e. and i. only for Persons and Place:
has bred in the World such dangerous contempts and Capital Errors, against
MAJESTY and SOVEREIGNTY in the height of all Sublimity; as no Power but the
greatest, nor Wisdom but the grauest, may, or can reform.

Besides, this I say, those other two, like Witchcraft or Iugling at the best,
namely, the MASS and VSVRY, the one debauching GOODNESS; the other equiuocating
TRVTH, in the EVCHARIST and EXCHANGE; have enchanted so our Traffic, as well
Downward and Upward, in the Art of Piety and Rules of Religion: as Outward and
Inward, in the Art of Equity and Rules of Justice; that as Mercy and Truth are
thereby kept asunder and cannot come together; so Righteousness and Peace can
no way kiss each other, which makes us all unhappy.

For whereas all things by Nature affect to be happy, and incline to
Perfection by the Rules of Order, and degrees of Goodness, whereof nothing on
Earth is capable but Man, in regard of his Reason; and none but Christians, by
a Doctrine of Humility, Patience, and Charity, in the Art of Piety, alias
Holiness, alias Godliness, alias Felicity, laid up in JESUS CHRIST, by means
of the Mysteries that belong to Religion, (Baptism, and the Eucharist) through
Faith and Repentance in a Kingdom of Obedience, Mercy, Love and Grace; obtain
it in Heaven: The MASS seeing Catholics enquire the way thither, tells them of
a Place without the Bounds of Nature, never seen, found, nor heard of, on
Earth, nor in Heaven, but fancide out by Dreams, VTOPIA, alias PVRGATORY. And
of a Doctrine how to merit Heaven, if they list of themselves, and for
themselves and others (their Friends at the least) by Hysteron Proteron, and
Rules of Disorder, changing Patience to Presumption, Humility into Pride, Love
to Rebellion, turning Creatures into Gods, Gods into Idols, and CHRIST into
ANTICHRIST, and Metamorphosing Grace, turn Grace into Merits, and Truth into
Lies, by an Art of Impiety, Ecclesiastical Popery eclipsing MAJESTY in GOD.
alias Idolatry, alias Heresy, alias Popery, in a Kingdom of Presumption,
Merits, and Free Will.

And whereas GOODNESS, TRVTH, and WISDOM, subsisting together by Name of
DEITY, made Man the first Model of Perfection like it self, for the use and
Good of All. And GRACE making BOVNTY to subsist in Humanity, by the GREATNESS of
it self, fixed MAJESTY and SOVERAINGTY in the Persons of some Men by the name
of KINGS, for all Subjects Weal; by an Art of Equity, alias Probity, alias
Honesty, alias Honor, alias Order, alias worldly Happiness: and a Mystery of
Justice in all Meum and Tuum, called Royal Exchange: Usury seeing Subjects seek
Happiness on Earth by the help of Gold and Silver, and seeking to behold the
MAJESTY of KINGS still lively represented, as it were in a Mirroer, by the
stamps of their Coins, tells the^ of a way from Beggars-Alley to Rich-mans Row,
beyond Meum and Tuum, or the Rules of right and reason, by the sound and sight
of Coin, without Exchange for any thing, or altering the Propriety, making
Money seem a God, that is but a Creature to Kings, as Kings are to God; by
Couetise and Pride, and adoring but the stamps that SOVEREIGNS put in Coin,
as the Heathen did their Idols, REMPHAM and RHYMMON, by an Art of Extortion,
alias Iudaisme, thereby deriuing Majesty from beyond the Bounds of Royalty, and
erecting such a Sovereignty above Empires and Monarchies, that Cardinals stand
for Kings, or Anti-Kinges at least, by Flattery, Pride, Presumption, Secular
Popery eclising MAJESTY in KINGS.
Couetise, and Money, in a Kingdom of Rebellion, alias High Treason, alias
Popery: whereby the World, as in an ecstasy, amazed and bewitched, seems still
to stand and wonder how Pride and Presumption, the one, Motive to Sin, the
other fall of Angels should make Covetousness the root of all Evil, The
Customer finding that Popery alone eclipsing MAJESTY, both in GOD and KINGS,
becomes the only let, to heavenly and earthly happiness, by means of the Mass
(the bane of Religion) Eclesiastically, and by means of Usury, (the bane by
Justice) secularly: Leaving the Mass to Divines, and entending directly to
search and fifth out Usury; is here interrupted by Ignarance and her Fellows.
and the love of Money to be flat Idolatry; that is to say, Popery, though GOD
himself have spoken it.

(Ignorance.) VTOPIA alias PVRGATORY? Impiety, alias Heresy? Extortion, alias
Iudaisme? Iniquity alias Rebelion? Couetise, Deceit? And the love of Money to
be flat Idolatry? The one from the Mass; the other, from Usury, and all to end
in Popery, Popery in Rebellion, and Rebellion with High Treason? What spelling
call you this? And how hang these words together? Since the Question is of
Happiness, which Catholics by Devotion, and the World seeks for by Money?
For grant that Impiety should lurk within the Mass, because it is a Mystery,
and pretends most Devotion, yet how becomes Iniquity a consequence of
Popery, though the Mass should seem Idolatry, and Usury savor Rebellion? Can
you Parallel the Mass with Usury, and the Eucharist with Exchange? And yet
prove a flat Antithesis between the one and the other, opposing the Mass to
the Eucharist, and Usury to Exchange? The Mass pretending Piety, as well as
the Eucharist, and Exchange presupposing the daily use of Money, no less then
Usury? Here must needs be Witchcraft, some Sorcery, some Iugling, a Paradox
at least, or a Mystery as you feign.

Thus Ignorance still tells Catholics, that my spelling is but idle, and my
labor all in vain; therefore to help them out of this maze, I must turn the
Leaf again, for herein lies the Mystery indeed that puts us all to pain.

The Customer forced to return to his former grounds, to satisfy Ignorance
about the Mystery of Iniquity.
It is granted at all hands, and Nature makes it good, that Religion and
Justice have ever gone together, their Union being so natural, that where
both of them are not, there can be neither. Now for Truth in Religion, Divines
have laid it open, that the way from wretchedness to Godliness, is by
Reformation, and finding Reformation to speed best in looking backward, have
happily made us happy, by reducing the Eucharist to her first Institution, and
branded the Mass with Idolatrous Impiety, and Heathen Superstition, which
being made so intricate by opinions and disputes, may be plainly discerned by
sense and reason thus.

Look but what the Glass of a Crystal Mirroer is (being specially fitted
by Art as well as Nature) to demonstrate and express the lively face and
feature of all that can but see, and have eyes to look into it, though the
thing represented by transubstantiating nor consubstanting with it, be neither
of the Glass, not any ways within it: the same is the Eucharist to all
intents and uses, by GOD and MAN so fitted, and by CHRIST himself ordained,
that as well his Deity in Divinity, as Manhood in Humanity, are therein
represented by blessed Bread and Wine, to all capable of Salvation, by Wit,
Will, and Reason, and Grace to believe withal, that his patient real
sufferings, and actual word of Promise, are the only all-sufficient means to
purge our Imperfections, and perfect all our Happiness, and to frame their
lives accordingly, use still their best endeavors; though his Person then at
Supper, held his Place there with others, and residing now in Heaven, be from
thence to fetch us thither. I say specially fitted, and such as can discern
with their own eyes and see, for though all Glass be needful for some use or
other, yet all have not power, nor are fitted to that End, and with blind Men
or Hood-winkt, even Myrrors are but idle: And Grace I said withal, to believe
beyond our sight, for though our wits by Art and Nature, may be capable of
Happiness, and our wills have reason to be forward to desire it, yet as Grace
resides in Heaven, and from thence begets Belief; so Faith alone above with
Grace, seeing Charity below to work out our Salvation, takes us by the hand to
lift us up thither. Whereby Faith and Charity, the one Fountain of all Graces,
and Mother of Obedience; the other, Bond of all Perfection, maintain as it
were a free continual Traffic, between the Throne of GOD in Heaven, and his
Church upon Earth, by Doctrine and Prayer for the daily use of Goodness. His
heavenly inspirings Downwards, and our holy desires Upwards, being as Angels
or Merchants between Him and us. Yet if this may not serve to make thine eyes
to see,
Hold, use my dim Spectacles, come sit thee down by me: The Customer here
endeavors his best, by the happiness of the Eucharist to illustrate Exchange,
the better to express at last the Mystical Misery of Usury.

And read thy self, or hark at least, choose whether,
How Christ and his Church (by this means) become
(wedded still together.
First hear, then see, then like, then love, and then live, be five
good points in wiuing:
If thou will live a happy life, but still remember thriuing.
But for a true and lively pattern, see two most happy Lovers, The orderly
wooing, Princely proceeding, joyful enterview, and first meeting together of
FRIDERICK the fifth, Count-Palatine of Rhyne, etc. and the Lady ELIZABETH,
Princess of Great Britain, Sole-Daughter to KING JAMES: fore-shewed their
likings to be honorable, their loves to be sanctified, their marriage to be
blessed, and them selves to be most happy, by the Grace of GOD and general
applaude of all. For Vox POPVLI vox DEI est.
that but lately came together, who wooing by their Pictures, as it were in a
Myrroer, each harkning after other, came at last both to see, and by seeing,
both to like, and by liking both to love, that though Art and Nature both,
deserved to be commended, that had wrought and wooed so well; yet Grace was
most admired, when coming both together, they saw, they met, they kissed. To
whom now All wish all Happiness, and I among the rest, for the good of
Religion and Justice both; that as our Eucharist has blinded the Mass, and
proved it but a lie, so Exchange may hood-winke Popery, and thrust out her eye.
I mean Usury. Ignorance. What Catholics and all, do they rejoice with
others, and Customers to? Customer. Yea, Catholics I mean, for good
Catholics are good Christians, where ever they go? Impudence. And are
Customers then Christians? Customer. Yea, and Kentish-men too? Discretion. Then
may they be honest, and so become happy? Customer. It may be we hope well, but
let that matter go.

Now this alone thus fitted for Common sense and reason, to show the use of the
Eucharist represented by a Glass: even as in a Glass or Myrroer, without
Impiety or Iniquity illustrates our Exchange: But in the Mass and Usury by
mere Deceptio visus, or some Legierte-de-maine, it is urged otherwise, which
proves both the Antithesis, The opposition or Antithesis between the Mass
and Usury, to the Eucharist and Exchange here proved.
and the Iugling of the Medium. For even as if the Myrroer had life both to
quicken, and power withal to change all within it, or about it, by turning
Signs into Substances, and Shadows into Bodies: Bread and Wine in the Mass
is adored for a GOD; and in Usury, the very Stamps which Sovereigns do but
put upon their (...) and their Coins, are worshipped for Idols.

This being the State of Traffic, for heavenly Happiness at this day in
GREAT-BRITAINE, in regard of true Religion, by means of the Eucharist restored
and maintained by our Learned grave Divines, and defended by our Sovereign, I
leave to our Lyturgie; The Lyturgie of the Churches of England, Scotland, and
Ireland.
and as a Customer and Lay Christian Man, out of Justice Commutatiue I am
confident for Exchange and dare speak boldly thus.

Exchange in buying and selling of vendible things (for I mean not mutual
bartring, of wares fro ware though the propriety by either be altered and gone,
nor lending out of Charity, though it loose by the loan.) I confess most
willingly, still presupposes Money, as Money, Gold and Silver, by the Name
of Bullion, and that Money must be Coynd. Now though Coining and Creating be
words of like import, as merely Synonimas, and mean but one Power fitting
none but GOD and KINGS; yet herein they varry. GODS Power in Creating being
absolutely absolute, is only all-sufficient, and subsisteth of it self
immediately: and that of KINGS being likewise absolute within their own
Dominions, is but so by GODS Commission mediatly. GODS Power is likewise
infinite all manner of ways, both in Heaven and in Earth, and his Will the
only Motive of all his own Endeavors: the Power and Wills of KINGS, are
bounded with their Kingdoms, Ex Legum Prescriptis, ne euadant in Tyrannos, or
become like other Men. GOD without a Pattern, Creates all Things of Nothing,
by the Goodness of Himself, and Man above all for his own use and glory, and
his other Creatures Good. Kings by Gods Example, by their own fixed Honor,
finding trust in their servants, and putting credit in their Subjects, add
Honor unto Honesty, Nobility unto Honor, and creat it in others by the
Greatness of themselves: And by their Pictures stamped in Bullion, value
Goodness in all things by the Truth of their proportions, of Good, Better, and
Best, both in Number, Weight, and Measure, expressed in their Coins by the
Name of Money, to their own special Honor first, and then their Subjects
Wealth, for both must go together, though they may not be confounded; Honestum
first, then Vtile, nor Vtile first, nor Honestum alone, Honestum and Vtile.
or Vtile without Honestum.

In a Word, GOD created all things by the Goodness of himself, that his
MAJESTY might be seen, and his SOVEREIGNTY subsist in the Order of his working
all the World over, though himself reside in Heaven, and the Beauty of his
Holiness in his sanctified Temples: But Kings must have matter to fix their
Goodness in, which is that we call Bullion; that the Essence of their
Greatness above other Men, that is to say, their Bounties, that is to say their
Honor, I mean that their Majesty's by their Faces and their Arms may be
seen, and their Soueraignties subsist in the Goodness of their Coin, as in a
Myrroer, all their Kingdoms through: though their persons be seen to sit
upright in their Throns, or reside in their Seats of sanctified Justice,
between Greatness and Decorum; namely, in their Courts of Equity, Subalterne,
and Sovereign, for Meum and Tuum Distributiuely, and Mints of Equalities, and
Staples of free Commerce Commutatiuely.

Whereby it now appears, how by all men's consent Gold and Silver, the Seats of
fixed Goodness by the Name of Bullion, become Ab Effectis, as it were King and
Queen of the world, because these alone make Kings in their Thrones
powerful, to protect both their Subjects and their Friends, both by Sea and
by Land, Traffic, Lapis Philosophicus.
and dispose of Traffic by their own Elixars and Mines, or Load-stones of
price within their own Dominions; as God by Goodness their only Judge and
Pattern, both in Number, Weight, and Measure, first made the World, and still
does guide the same.

Each King in this respect being a lively Idea, even of Deity it self, so much
excelling in Preheminency of Power, for his Person and Place, and Prerogative
of Wisdom for Bounty and Grace, by how much they endeavor to express in
themselves, and show forth to others the Characters of MAJESTY, and Titles of
their SOVEREIGNTY in the truth of their Coin. I mean by their Exchange.

And how Exchange alone becomes that Cordial preservative, which easing all
Greefes in sores, Exchange, Vniuersalis medicina.
suppling all sores in diseases, and curing all diseases in particular Members,
holds the whole Bodies of Kingdoms in health; the sacred Rules whereof, as no
profane Couetise could ever comprehend, nor confident Empericke attain to
practice, so none of private difcretion or partial affection, may presume to
alter, or any way control, as being a Doctrine peculiar unto none, but the
Grauest and Wisest in highest Authority, and Sovereigns themselves.

Bullion therefore Catexochen, that is to say, all kind of Gold and Silver not
Coined or made current, (for even Coins that are not current may be taken for
Bullion) by general consent, as the Sun in the highest Globe of Glory, and
Money being the Beams; Exchange becomes the light that makes the world to
see: And as Bullion being the Pylot, Money is the Stern, and Exchange the
Compass that guides all courses right; nay, as Bullion being the Chylus, Money
is the Blood, Exchange becomes the Spirit that quickens all the Body. In a
word, Bullion being the Body and very Blood of KINGS. Money is the Medium
between Subjects and their Kings, and Exchange the very Cyment that glewes
them both together. O that my Tongue or Pen were able to express,
Or had the gift to make Men understand
Those great and graund effects, of Sacred Happiness,
Exchange alone would work by Kings and Counsels hand:
Religious Justice would then so bless our Land,
That Men on Earth might see, by this Idea made,
What Heaven it self does boad, by this our Kingly Trade.
Seeing then that Bullion, or Gold and Silver Coynd, is the Body and Blood of
Kings, not as Men but as Gods, truly represented to the comfort of their
Subjects through all their Dominions by the stampes of their Money, though
their Persons keep their Thrones. And Exchange that Spirit of Traffic and
Mystical Cyment, that glewes so fast together the communion and coniuction of
Sovereigns and Subjects, by Reciproke Love and Grace, as Religion and Justice
both, teach us to believe:

Let Us all cry out of Rome, wherein first was hatched the Doctrine that enchants
and transubstantiates our Eucharisticke Sacraments of the Body and Blood of
CHRIST, represented every where within his Church Militant, as lively as in a
Glass, till his coming again (though his Person be in Heaven) by blessed
Bread and Wine, into Idolatrous Masses; and our Christian Exchange, into Jewish
Usury. I speak therefore with confidence to all that seek for Happiness, and
love their own Salvation, not bewitched as it were, or void of sense and
reason, be wary still of Italy, as Aeneas with his Misselto when he traueld
toward Hell, and let all come home from Rome, for fear of the curse that by
Justice hangs upon her.

For if He alone, whose absolute Power could work so well, that all he made
became still like himself, exceeding Good, to his own eternal Glory, and Man's
immortal bliss. GOD I say, (the Father) GOD I mean (the Son) and GOD the
third time, (the Spirit) though once for all. (The Trinity in Unity, and Unity
in Trinity) whom only to know is everlasting Life, and joy but to hear and
make mention of his Name; be that spring or Fountain of Goodness, Truth, and
Wisdom, from whence all streams besides, both in Heaven and Earth derive not
only Essence but Happiness in being, and whence to swerve, is to turn again
to nothing; Quia vidit Deus, quod omnia quae fecerat erant valde bona: What
greater bane then Sin? Sin. Pride.
What greater sin then Pride? What greater Pride then the height of all
Presumption in one sinful Man, that usurping on the Powers both of Heaven and
Earth, Darkness. Freewill. Profaneness*
to drown Light in Darkness, both in Goodness and Truth of his own mere
Freewil, gives Laws unto Justice, and profanes all Religion, the Rules of
Truth and Goodness, both in God and Kings?

If heavenly Goodness and Truth in all Perfections, both of Nature and Art, be
those beautiful aspects, and beneficial influences of heavenly beatitudes,
which the Grecians do describe by their Calocogathia, to make al things happy;
Chaos. Evil.
Quia Bono suo diffusiue and vere constant omnia. What Evil so infectious?
What infection so poisonous, and what Poison so accursed, as that Chaos of
Doctrine, that by Pride and Presumption, Presumption. Merits. Equivocation.
profaning Goodness turns Grace into Merits, and Equiuocating Truth, turns
Truth into Lies, in all the Contractes, both of GOD and Men?

If Gold and Silver, of all the sollide Bodies which Nature presents at the
Standart of Truth, Truth.
be fittest and surest by general consent to fix Goodness in, for easier
extention in vendible Commerce by the Name of Bullion. Quia omne Bonum, Bullion.
being sui diffusiuum and quanto communius eo melius, and infunditur semper
secundum meritum materiae, Fraud. Wrong. Priuate-Gaine. Couetise. Deceit.
What fraud like public wrong? What wrong like private gain? And what gain
more deceiptfull, then couetously to hoard or sophisticate the pureness and
finenesse which Nature weighes in Bullion, for the general use of Goodness by
Traffic among Men?

If Money or Coin be those figured proportions of Goodness, more or less
for Number and Weight, Money.
by Majesty laid out at the Standart of Justice to value Goodness by, Justice.
Vt quod vspiam nasciter boni id apud omnes affluat; and by Sovereignty made
current in all vendible Commerce. Quia omne quod efficit Tale, id ipsum magis
Tale esse semper oportet: Dis order Error. Injustice.
What Danger like Disorder? What Disorder like to Errors? And what Error like
Injustice, when Subjects become Coyners, the only Trade of Kings?

Lastly, if the Mystical practice of Goodness, Truth, and Wisdom, that is
meant by Exchange, be that Ars Artium, and vera Ars regnandi, which visibly
demonstrates those heavenly Aspectes themselves, of MAJESTY and SOVEREIGNTY,
that Deity imparts unto Mortal Men on Earth by the Name of KINGS, in the
stamping of their Coin: Or if the Standarts themselves, with all their
proportions of Weights, Numbers, Standarts. Proportions.
and Measures, for general Equity be the Sovereigns charge only; as the
Coynage of Money is their only Hoc-age, and belongs to none but Majesty, and
Exchange their Compass to guide all courses right: what greater Error then
Priuat-mischiefe? What greater Mischief then public Inconveniences? And what
so inconvenient, as that which perverting both the Waightes, Numbers, and
Measures, in all our Proportions, and Worth of all our Standarts, debauching
Equity in Actions, and profaining Piety in the Consciences of Men, by a
Mystical Iniquity threats ruin and confusion to Empires, Kings, and
Kingdoms? Iniquity. Usury.
VSVRY. Against which Art of witchcraft.

Would God my Pen or Tongue could write or tell,
Or had the gift to make Men understand,
Those strong and strange effects of mischiefs hatched in Hell,
That Couetise by Usury, begets in every Land:
Then Kings and Counsels both, would lift up eyes and hand,
To see on Earth by this Idea made,
What Hell does win, and Heaven does loose by this accursed Trade.
So that, great out of question are the Mysteries of Popery, by Impiety and
Iniquity, through Pride, Presumption, Couetise, and Money; the sum whereof is
this: One Man of sinful Flesh, obtruding upon Deity, and dispising Humanity,
without remorse of Conscience, accursed of the Spirit, supported by Cardinals,
Preached by Jesuits, admired still by Flatterers, tells Catholics of a
Purgatory, but sends them straight to Hell; resides at Rome.

Is not this the selfsame ANTICHRIST so long ago foretold? that Child of
perdition? and professed Adversary to Religion and Justice? exalted above all
that is or can be God, or fit to be adored? so seated in the Church on Earth,
that he boastes himself for GOD? and brauing God and Kings, makes Emperors
but his Footmen, and Kings his very vassals, in despite of God and Man?

Thus as Piety and Equity, the two general Fountains of heavenly and earthly
Happiness, flowing every way together from Religion and Justice, have the
Eucharist and Exchange by mutual Love and Grace to maintain their currents,
for the Catholic good of Christians: How Impiety and Iniquity meet in one
body of Popery, Ecclesiastically and Secularly.
so Impiety and Iniquity the bane of all Felicity, begot and hatched together in
our Body of Popery, and Doctrine of Idolatry, by Merits and Free Will, have the
Mass and Usury to bewitch the world from Rome.

If then the Mass opposed to our EVCHARIST, and contrary to our CREED (which
enioynes us to believe, as we look to be happy, that JESUS CHRIST himself
here suffering for us, and for our Salvation, ascended up to Heaven, and there
sitting by his Father, is thence to come again to fet us up thither) must
needs be Heresy by common Sense and Reason, in all that do believe it; and
a Sin of higher Nature to such as in their Consciences being privy to the
contrary, yet standing still obdurat, refuse their own Salvation, and despise
the Spirit of Grace: shall not Usury then I say, be accounted high Treason? And
then what is Popery wherein both together meet? But stand something nearer,
and read further yet.

If that MAN alone, whose Native Bounty proceeding from Grace, and gracious
disposition setting forth his Greatness above all other Men, makes himself
most honored and reueren'st as a GOD, with all Men's consent, by the Name of
KING.

If that KING I mean, whose Essence being Bullion, of the sefe-same Gold and
Silver (which none can Coin but he, and shows him to be KING) gives many a
thousand pound for his own special Honor, and benefit of all.

Now if that selfsame Person being thus thy MAN-KING GOD, to whom thy self
among others, by Nature and consent having vowed thy Subjection as to thy
lawful SOVEREIGN, have sworn Fealty and Allegiance, or should do at the
least; to comfort thee withal, and make thee still mindful of his Greatness
and Grace, should give thee but an Angel, a Shilling, or a Penny (for all

O the unity or union (alias Happiness) of GREAT-BRITAINE, if Justice
Commutatiue (alias Traffic) had her Staples for Order, as Distributive has
her Courts for Equity, and Religion he^ Temples for Piety and Devotion! For her
Home-borne Staples turned to Mart-Townes beyond Seas, makes her at discor^

But who believes Truth from the mouth of a Customer?


) What would thou do or say? He is honorable and loving, and expecting
naught but Reciproke Love and Thanks, vouchsafes to respect thee of his own
mere Native Grace? Should not thou be likewise Loyal and honest at the
least, and with Duty, Fear, and Reverence, respect his Honor when thou see
it in his Picture, or beholdst it as his Face, and in no wise to abuse it? And
as He by free gift, or his own first Exchange, did value ir unto thee by the
worth of Himself, and receives it so again: so thou, unto another being
stamped for his Honor, and thy mutual Good? Can any be so mad then, or foolish
at the best, (I speak to sense and reason, let Jesuits always go, Rumpantur
and ilia Codro) as to say, believe or think that this KINGS Royal Person, in
Body, Blood, or Bone, is any way within it, when he sees, or hears, or knows
him to be sitting in his Throne, or residing elsewhere? Yet such is the
Witchcraft wherewith Jesuits in Popery enchanting the World, seduce poor
Catholics by the Mass in this kind, and damnable Doctrine of Free Will and
Merits.

Now think but ere thou speak, and then speak, but as thou think as thy
conscience does advise thee, without equivocation. Had not I then reason, out
of Duty, Fear, and Zeal, to the Honor of sacred KINGS, and Good of all
Catholics, (not yet void of Conscience) by the Spirit of Adoption, to cry
out as I did, against the Witchcraft of Popery, alias Usury, and that Man od
Sin, and Monster of Rome, in these verses following: Au Loup pourtant
Subjects, Monarchs tous et Roys
Ca Chrestiens, Catholics, Estats trestous, en sum
Ca Ca tous Princes libres, Defenseurs de la Foy
Venez tous a la chasse du Loup-Garou de Rome.
Here therefore Subjects all, here Kings and Monarkes either,
Here here you Princes free, and States both all and some,
Here Christian Kings and Catholics, come now join hands together,
Defend with us the Christian Faith, and rowse this Wolf of Rome.


In a word, Ab Jove principium (REGES) Iouis omnia plena. And to give GOD
thanks withal, for the blessed Memories of our Princes and Peers, that
heretofore with-stood him, and thrice blessed learned hand of our SOVEREIGNS
late Endeavors that so constantly pursues him. For as CHRIST now puts down
Antichrist, make Cardinals crooch to KINGS, that would seem Anti-Kinges, and
as the Mass gives way to the Eucharist; so make Usury know Exchange, and
Popery is overthrown: therefore I say again, Ab Jove principiu^ REGES?

(Ignorance.) Ab Jove Principium REGES? What means this Repetition, and why
call ye so on KINGS? (Customer.) That MAJESTY may be seen, and SOVEREIGNTY
might subsist, as in GOD so now in KINGS; for GOD forgets not his part, let
Kings perform their own. (Ignorance.) As how? (Customer.) By their Bullion
and Exchange, for if Coining and Creating be merely Synonimas, and mean but
one thing, what creating is to GOD, the same is Coining unto Kings, least
Subjects should be Coyners. (Ignorance.) How shall Kings and Sovereigns be so
able to Create, that Subjects be no Coyners? (Customer.) By their Standarts,
and their Bullion: For as a steady Standart, and store of Bullion to Coin at
will, by means of their Exchange, makes all things good cheap, holds
Subjects to their Trades, and Trades in request, whereby Kings become
Powerful, and Subjects Wealthy: So if Standarts be uncertain, and Kings
want Bullion, as Coin grows engrost into private Men's hands, all things wax
dear, Kings beeome weak, and Subjects poor, whilst Coin it self by
Usury, (which Merchants call Exchange) eats out Industry in Trades, and
Merchants by Monopolies seek to strangle Traffic. (Ignorance.) What mean
you by Standarts? [Customer.] I mean Unity and Truth, in Weights, Numbers, and
Measures. But in passing thus by Standarts, my mind becomes transported, and
cannot but admire the Wisdom both of GOD, and powerfulness of Kings. For
when I read the BIBLE (o read it Kings and Counsels) and find therein
commanded, but Vnum Pondus, and Vna Mensura: I resolve thus with my self;
Surely, if Truth be tied to Goodness, as Goodness is to God, and Kings
themselves be Gods; then whereby can their Goodness, that is to say their
Bounty, that is to say their Greatness, be more sensibly discerned then in
their Standarts? As where withal alone, by the Power of their Preemption, and
Quitrents of their Customs, being potentially possessed of all the Lands and
Goods their kingdoms do contain (though they leave notwithstanding to each
of their Subjects his Meum and Tuum, and full use of his own) they may raise
and pull down, the prices and worth, of every Man's wealth, at their own wills
and pleasure, by means of their Exchange. (Ignorance.) And why not so by
Usury? (Customer.) Because Exchange either lovingly gives, or else by buying
and selling, makes Meum to be Tuum, and Tuum to be M^um, by altering the
propriety, for Reciproke Good: whereas Usury neither gives out of Love, nor
lends out of Charity nor so buys or sels as alters any propriety; but for the
(...) and ^o^ed of Money, contracts for priuate-gaine. (Discretion.) ^ut a^mit
all this at home might well be performd between Sovereigns and Subjects within
their own Dominions. How shall Kings with Kings maintain their Standarts,
and keep Subjects from Coining? (Customer.) By their Treaties of Enter-course
and Mutual Contracts, to maintain Equity, prevent advantage, and keep fraud
from shelter. For if GOD have commanded in so strict words and terms, but
Vnum Pondus and Vna Mensura; as Himself is but One, and KINGS but his
LIEVTENANTS, to whom DEVS omnibus Idem: by what warrant or Commission can they
justify their Coynage, but by their Standarts? the special charge of KINGS;
to give thereby as well true worth and content, as true length and breadth to
all proportions; for Proportions show Perfection, whose uses being Union and
Ends being Peace; bring all at last to Happiness by Identity of Standart, and
Mutual Exchange. For look how Exchange, of the selfsame Truth and Goodness,
in Gold and Silver fixed, by the Name of Bullion, way'd out in Coin, and
warranted for use by the name of Money, shows Men to be Kings by general
consent, and Kings to be Gods, by infusiue Grace: And how Gold and Silver
becomes in this respect, the very Body and Blood of Kings; for without the
Power of coynage, even Kings are but Men, and without their materials, how can
they Coin Money? As the same Exchange I say, by altering the propriety (though
not the Nature of either Kings or Bullion) of Meum into Tuum Reciprokely;
becomes the very Cyment that glewes so together the communion and conjunction
of Sovereigns with their Subjects, and Subjects each with other: Even so the
Identity of Standarts between Kings and their Kingdoms by Reciproke
Commerce, is the means of mutual Happiness; as well in Matter, Order, and
End, as Persons and Place, by protecting all their Livings, all their
Liberties, all their Lives, all their Honor, and the Peace of all their Land.
The neglect whereof, or Ignorance, choose whether, has made Popes to keep down
Emperors, Cardinals challenge Kings and Subjects to be Coyners.

But howsoever heretofore things have been neglected, unknown, or mistaken,
which the Ages to come must reform as they may; MAJESTY at all hands must
first or last be seen, and SOVEREIGNTY must subsist, by one means or other,
or never let Subjects ever look to be happy. Wherein therefore, be thou Popish
or precise, so thou be not obstinate, and unwilling to arise, or become so
desperate, that thou will close thine eyes; lend me but thine ear awhile, and
serious attention, for the better understanding of the State of all in
question, since I speak to Discretion, and write to sense and reason.

Whatsoever (...) Is, or has any Being, is manifest by Light. Being and Light
are Things inseparat, Light begotten by Being, and Being appearing to Be such
as it Is by Light; for as Light has subsistence only from Being; so Being is
made manifest, so or so to be by Light. Being Loves to Live, and eternally to
Be; Light Loves to show, and ever to be Seen; so both become manifest. Being
still in Light, and ever Light in Being. From which Reciproke Love, proceeds
the Spirit of Union, moving still from Being, and collecting still by Light,
and thus they Love and Live eternally together, ESSE, LVX, SPIRITVS, VNVM. and
this VNVM or ONE is ALL in ALL; namely, that blessed State of Goodness,
wherein by Creation, we Love, Live, Move, Enjoy, See, and still Behold all our
happy Beings, in Pondere Numero and Mensura, by the Names of GOD, CREATOR,
IEHOVA, or DEITY.

Among Things created, the first that was made and called Good, was Light; that
Light might show and distinguish Goodness by degrees, as Good, Better, and
Best; for in all Things Created, Goodness is comparatiue in, and diffusiue of
it self; and Motion is in Goodness, as Collection is in Light, by the Spirit
of Union; for as Being cannot Be without Light, so Light without Goodness, can
have no Being at All. Light the form of Goodness, and Being the form of
Light; such is their Union or Unity, Identitie or Idem.

Now Truth and Goodness have likewise one Essence or Being together by the
Spirit of Union: so that GOD being Goodness, must likewise be Truth. Truth
then being in Deity Creating, as Goodness in Humanity Created; can Truth in
GOD be Deceit or Fraud in KINGS? For KINGS are GODS. Can Unity in GOD make
Deity still subsist, and Division in Kings maintain Regality? Or can Unity
and Truth be any way divided in GOD or his Lieutenants? How then shall their
MAJESTY be discerned without Light Intuitiuely? And how shall their
SOVEREIGNTY be able to subsist Materially? If Kings be Per aeual, what God is
Per amont, their Unity must be Union, and their Identity must be Idem, for Deus
omnibus Idem.

And as the Essence of GOD is his own diffusiue Goodness, and omnipotency in
GOD essential with his Greatness, by the power of Creating: so the Essence of
Kings, is their Goodness fixed in Bullion, for their Bullion shows their
Bounty, their Bounty shows their Greatness, by the absolute Power of Coining;
for even Bullion still vncoynd, is naught of it self, but a weight of Massy
Mowld and senseless Being: nor is Money to be valued but only for the use,
which is that we term Exchange.

But if the brightness of this Sun, seem to dazell all thy sight, or thine
eyes see not clear to discern this Mystery, let Art relieve Nature by the
help of Grace, and though comparisons may seem fearful between Heavenly
and Earthly Beings, yet Examples may illustrate (I hope) without offense,
where Piety and Probity contend for nothing else, but with all prostrate
reverence, to see sacred Majesty between Greatness and Decorum, and to serve
and set forth Sovereignty in her own subsistence: Therefore look but in my
Myrroer, and see what I have seen, and with my dim Spectacles read as I have
done.

If all our Good and Happiness can grow from none other then GOD and his
LIEVTENANTS, what Goodness is to God, let Bounty be to Kings, but all depend on
God in respect of his Goodness, so let all depend on his Kings in regard of
their Bounty, to show their Greatness. Now Goodness in God is every way his
own as his natural Essence, and Kings by his infusion; so Bounty still in
Kings by Grace, Consent, and Goodness, still fixed in themselves, descends unto
Subjects. This leads us straight to Bullion, for though God by his Goodness made
All Things of nothing, and so preserues them still, yet K ngs must have Matter
to fix their Goodness in. This points at Greatness, and leads us to
Sovereignty, showing Creatures to be Creatures, and Subjects to be Subjects, to
avoid Confusion; for as GOD above Creates; so Kings below Coin: so then
here comes in Money, for as GOD shows his MAJESTY in all things created
Infusiuely, so Kings in their Money Intuitiuely: and as Sovereignty in God
subsists of it self in the Beauty of his work, by means of his Goodness; so
Sovereignty in Kings subsists of it self, in the Greatness of their Bounty,
by means of their Money. But as God still creates, and his Goodness still
releeuing; so Kings must still Coin, and their Bounties still be giving. Are
not they then strange Subjects, that repine at Kings Bounty, and Sovereigns
still bestowing? Help Kings but to their Bullion, and they cannot be more too-
Bountiful, then God may be to- Good. Happy then those Kingdoms, where Kings
are known by Bounty, and their Bounty finds their Bullion: for as God by his
Goodness makes Catholics happy Christians, by Communion of himself in
blessed Bread and Wine Mystically; So Kings relieve their Subjects, and
communicate their Essence in purged Gold and Silver, weighed out in their
Coin. God woorking by the Eucharist, and Kings by their Exchange.
[Ignorance.] And why not so by Usury, since their work is still by Money;
wherein lies the Witchcraft that makes the difference? [Customer.] In the very
Name and term, and by taking the one for the other: For Exchange even in Money,
making Meum to be Tuum, and Tuum to be Meum, still alters the Propriety, for
one respect or other immediately: but Usury, Quasi mons a mouendo, by the using
of Money would feign seem Exchange, though she alter no propriety, putting
Money to her shifts, and sending her a Whooring, receives her home with shame.
[Ignorance.] Ignotum per Ignotius: I cannot spell your Reasons. [Customer.] Why
hark a little further, and stop not thine ears, nor wrangle with thy self
by taking This for That, least Quos perire Deus vult, Hos ipse Deus occaecat.
The KING Coins a Penny, which none may do but He, for fear of High Treason,
whose weight by the Standart, either is, or else should be, thirty two Grains
of Wheat, in the midst of the ear. A Penny, according to the Standart at the
Conquest, the weight whereof now makes three pence.
This weight the King warrants by his Crown, Seal of his Arms, Letters of
his Name, stamp of his Face, and by the worth of himself values it to others;
and being so made current, Haec est MONETA MEA, Hoc est CORPUS MEVM.
he calls it by the Name, and says it is his [Money] not as Mons a mouendo quia
minime mouet; but Moneta, quasi monens ne quid fraudis in Materia Signo vel
Pondere fiat) and by his Exchange, In Permutationibus rerum presto est Communis
Mensura, ex hominum Institutis non vt Naturae nata. Haec autem Moneta est,
Rebus Mensura^ and aestimationem inferens. Estque Medius quodamodo (...) id est
cuncta metitur, ac Rerum inaequalium precia, ea mensura, ad aequlitatem
reuocantur. Et quia ex Lege est, non Natura, proinde Numi prorepsit appellatio,
a Nomo, id est Lege. Estque tanquam Rerum omnium Fide-Iussor. Ante cuius
inuentionem Rerum ipsarum fiebat permutatio, and Res, indigentia metiebantur.
Coelij Rhodigini, fol. 896. lib. 23.
maintains it for a Penny all his Kingdom through. What warrant now has
Usury without altering the propriety, by consent of contract and honest
marriage, to prostitute this Penny to false clipping, or strange Coining. For
when Kings thus Coin Money, as they value it unto others by the worth of
themselves, they receive it so again by the reason and rule of their own
Exchange. But Bankers use Money if it come to their hands, as Bauds abuse
Virgins, till they get a great belly by a monstrous kind of Incest, and
unlawful Coynage, and to cover shameless Usury, call their Interest their
Exchange; like those that call their Bastards, their natural Children. If a
Bushel be not measure, or a yard be more or less then the size of the
Standard, the Clearke of the Market soon takes you by the ears, and then you
know what follows; take greater heed of Money, and run away from Usury, as
you would from Jesuits, the Patrons now of Popery, for fear of Souls and
Bodies. [Igno.] Though Usury prove Popery, yet how came it first from Rome?
[Customer.] With the Mass and Idolatry: for, as the Mass of Creatures makes
Idols; so Usury makes of Money, and the Mass with Usury go parallel together,
as the Eucharist with Exchange; so the Eucharist to the Mass, and Exchange to
Usury, make a flat Antithesis, and Diametricall opposition the one against the
other. [Ignorance.] Is Usury then a greater Sin, then to clip, wash, and
counterfeit, or to coin false Money? [Customer.] By far, like the Mass, if
wittingly and willingly it be obstinately used; yea, by so many Degrees, as I
know not how far; for that eclipseth MAJESTY, and so blindfoldes but her
Face, that she cannot well be seen. This with her own Finger so puts out her
eyes, as makes her unable both to see and to be seen. That offends only
against the Persons of Kings. This against their Power, Wills, Wisdoms,
Sovereignty, and Subsistence of their Essence and States. That against a KINGS
PRE-EMINENCE, for his Person and Place, whose room may be supplyd though a
Jesuit had destroyed him. This against PREROGATIVE, blows up Kings and
Kingdoms, both for Matter, Persons, Place, Order, and End, which cannot be
supplyde; the rest you may advise on, for I dare go no further.

Now had not I then reason (let common sense be Judge) in the Epilogue or
Conclusion of my second APOLOGY, to reply confidently thus? That EXCHANGE in
Merchandise, and MARCHANDIZING Exchange, is that Labyrinth of Errors and
private practice, whereby though KINGS wear Crowns, and seem powerfully to
reign; yet particulars Bankers, private Societies of Merchants and covetous
Persons, whose Ends are Priuate-gaine; are able to suspend their Counsels, and
Comptroll their Policies: offering Bounty to their SOVEREIGNS, KINGS, and
QVEENES; the very Fountains of Goodness, but to shelter their shame, and
lending for Inrerest to EMPERORS and KINGS, that only can Coin, and should
have to spend largely, and give unto others; making Sovereigns thus but
Subjects, and Vassals to be Kings. That such was the strength of that stain
and stay of Piety, that contempt of Justice, that seed of Dissension, that
World of war, that Art of Witchcraft, VSVRY. And that such is and will be
the Power thereof still, at all occasions, till Kings and Counsels take their
own charge in hand, and next to RELIGION that sanctifies all, relieve and
maintain the Nurce of JUSTICE that rectifies all; to wit, our
FREE-BORNE-TRAFFIQVE, I meant in ENGLAND, and ENGLISH-TRAFFIQVE.

But, In Magnis voluisse sat est, sint caetera DIVVM.

[Ignorance.] Then farewell private profit, and Interest for Money, with
Couetise and Pride, and equiuocating Popery; yea, farewell Fraud and all. I
will become a Catholic, for they may be Christians and honest Men to, and
learn to know the Eucharist, and live by Exchange. [Discretion.] And so will I
do too; for glorious out of question must those kingdoms be, whose Kings thus
by Coynage hold Amity together, their Nobles most honorable, and their
Subjects most happy. But suppose all this effected in their Standarts by
Justice; how should Catholics be agreed in points of Religion? seeing the
Mass is so predominant, both at Rome and in Purgatory, and the Pope is so
admired by Jesuits and others. [Custoemr.] Religion and Justice are so twisted
still together by the Twine of one Truth, their Catholic Beam and Standart,
that take away but Usury by restoring our Exchange, and the Mass cannot
subsist; and remoouing the Mass, the Pope must needs be packing, and
Purgatory vanish: Now Religion must have Bishops, though Popes may be gone,
and Justice will have Kings though Cardinals be none: so that, in Ordine and
Spiritualia, or consequence, choose whether; Catholics may be Christians and
honest Men too, though Jesuits prove neither.

[Ignorance.] But how come the Mass and Usury by Popery so united? [Customer.]
What the Mass is to Religion, the same is Usury to Justice, and they both go
together; whereby it comes to pass, that Catholics and Christians are
bewitched so by Jesuits. [Ignorance.] Wherein lies the Witchcraft?
[Customer.] In the Names of the one, and Idolatry of the other; for as Jesuits
would seem Jesus, so Usury would use Money, not as Jesus a Savior, for indeed
they are nothing less, nor as Money is Moneta, quasi monens ne quid fraudis in
Materia Signo vel Pondere fiat: but as Mons a mouendo, quod minime mouet.
[Ignorance.] But how does the Idolatry of the Mass bring Usury to be Popery?
[Customer.] By the Pictures in Coin, for Vt mundo Natura Cursum, Soli lumen,
sic gratiam Auro; Men looking on the Beauty of Bullion, and powerfulness of
Money, by too too much admiring the pourtraitures of KINGS expressed in their
Coin, fall in love with their Pictures, as the Heathen with their Idols.
[Ignorance.] It seems then by this means, that the Mass may prove a higher
sin then Heresy, and Usury more then Treason, what sin may that be?
[Cust.] Nay there forsooth I leave you, for I dare not once think thereof much
less determine. [Ignorance.] What helps to excuse it for the sins that are
past? [Customer.] Only mere simplicity, frailty, and weakness. [Ignorance.]
And what may expiat the guilt thereof in either? [Customer.] Hearty repentance
for all that is past, and a serious entention to forbear it hereafter.
[Ignorance.] Then farewell sinful Mass and Usury both together, since
wilfulness obdurates so fearfully in either. O damnable Jesuits, that
bewitch still the World by such kind of Popery! But what is all this to
Customers? [Customer.] The CVSTOMER, by his Method, seeing MAJESTY no where
fixed, but in GOD and Christian KINGS Personally, and Himself a sworn Servant
and Customer to a Christian KING, whose MA: seems ecclipsed and defective in
his Customs, shows here the Reason why, and manner how, He, Ex Officio,
became forc'st (first of all others) to search out the Grounds of so Great
Injustice, Radicitus as it were, and Originally. Namely, Finding that Impiety
by direct opposition did undermine Godliness in all Christian Religion still by
means of the Mass, and Iniquity by Usury, to attempt the like on Equity in
all Kingly Justice, by misvsing their Moneys Mystically: and observing
withal, how Justice and Religion, by holding hands together, did illustrate
each other, He came at last to discern how POPERY by the Mass, disguising
Christianity, and bewitching Catholics, found the way to hoodwink Kings and
enthral Kingdoms ecclesiastically: and with VSVRY as with Gunpowder to blow
the^ up at last, with their Customers and Customs. Whereupon, the Customer
leaving Impiety with the Mass, for Divines to lay open, (following still his
Method) in the Mystery of Iniquity, or Secular kind of Popery, He betook
Himself directly to the POPES own Person: whose main Subsistence being SIN,
and Rome by Jubilees, etc. the Mart and Staple thereof, to poison the world, by
Bankers and Bawdes, drawing home his Annates, Peter Pence, and Reuennewes,
depends most on VSVRY. For, having no natural Mines of Gold and Silver, nor
Mints to make Money, nor Wares worth the battering: HE settles there, and makes
Port-sale from thence of all kind of SIN, articificially for Bullion, and
rebelliously usurping the EMP. powerful Mints, makes HIS Kingly Stamps strike
His Counterfeit Coin, as by his Face thereon, and Arms is intuitiuely evident
and Catholickly clear. And, instead of lawful Tributes (as Caesar sometimes
had) settes Taxes, Imposts, and Impositions, by Discretion to keep KINGS and
Kingdoms under, still distracting their STANDARDS, and debauching their
EXCHANGE.
The same with GOD and KINGS, for Customers are Catholics, and Christian Men
too, and feign would be happy; but as Popery by Idolatry presuming upon
Deity, eclipseth MAJESTY in KINGS; so Customers by Usury, are put by their
Customs. [Ignorace.] Why, from whence came their Customs? [Custo.] From their
Staples. [Ignorance.] Where then are their Staples? [Cuctomer.] They were
sometimes at home, though now exilde beyond Seas, and would feign return, if
Usury were put down; for our Temples and our Staples were wont to stand
together. [Ignorance.] How Temples with Staples? [Customer.] Religion and
Justice have ever held together, and as the one had her Altars for Unity and
Truth still kept in her Temples; so the other had her Mints united to her
Staples, and those Mintes Coined the Money wherewith Traffic at our Ports did
acknowledge her homage, before she crossed the Seas, which is that we call
Customs. [Ignorance.] But what have KINGS to do with Staples, in the question
of Money? [Customer.] In regard of their Bullion, since none but they may
Coin, and their Bullion is no where to be found but at their Staples, by
virtue of their Load-stones that are there laid up together: so that, No
Staples, no Load stones: No Loadstones, no Bullion: No Bullion, no Mints: No
Mints, no Money: No Money, no Customs: No Customs, no Honor: No Honor, no
Homage: No Homage, no Justice: and no Justice, no Religion: and all for lack
of Staples. [Ignorance.] Why, say KINGS should Coin no Money for want of
their Bullion, and say they have no Staples, yet if Subjects may but Coin, so
it be at their Mints, what harm can come of it? [Customer.] If Subjects may
be Coyners, that is as Usury, alias Popery would have it, then what becomes of
Exchange, and then where is Bounty? Where Is Greatness, that makes KINGS wear
the Crown? Nay, when the Spirits of their Pulses have no blood of their own,
where subsistes their Essence, if their Substance be gone? [Ignorance.]
Indeed this seems something. [Customer.] If any thing be something, grant
this, or grant nothing; therefore let Common Sense be Judge, if I had not
sometimes Reason, in seeking after Staples, thereby to find Bullion, when
comparing things by contraries to illustrate each other; I crid out against
Couetise and Priuate-gaine thus.

Great, Greater, and Greatest of all, must their Accounts be, both to GOD and
KINGS, that prepostorously perverting their proper Materials, turn their best
helps for Bullion to their private advantage, to the intolerable disturbance
both of Court and Country, and almost unrecoverable wrong to the King and his
Crown. [Ignorance.] This is much to their Mints indeed, but what are Staples
to Justice? [Customer.] What are Temples to Religion? [Ignorance.] Temples sure
are Sanctuaries for the maintenance of Religion: for, I read it thus written. O
worship the Lord in the Glory of his Sanctuary, and Beauty of his Holiness,
which I take to be Temples and Churches, in regard of Devotion. [Customer.]
Even so say of Staples. O Honor the King in the Greatness of his Bounty, or
Justice of his Courts Subalterne and Sovereign, which in this case of ours, I
call the COMMON PLEAS, together with his Staples, in regard of Meum and Tuum,
by the one, and Bullion by the other. For as the Grave Court of STAR CHAMBER,
by set days of hearing and presence of the King, shows MAJESTY and SOVERAGNTY
between Greatness and Decorum, Vitia perimendo seruatis hominibus, besides
his own Counsel, and PRIVY-COVNSELL-TABLE:

And as the KING on his BENCH, in the midst of his Judges, by public
proceedings between Him and his Subjects, doing Justice to All, breaks Bread
to the meanest according to Birthright; and out of love and affection (as well
may beseem Him) stands gracious to some more then all the rest: protects
notwithstanding from private oppression, or wronging themselves, the Livings,
Liberties, Honor, and Weddinges of Pupils and Orphans in a Nurcery besides,
for his Wards and Liueries, whereby KINGS are nourishing Fathers, and QVEENES
nourishing Mothers, as well as Gods and Judges:

So the KING in his Court of Publick-COMMON-PLEADINGS, desciding disputes
between Subject and Subject, about Meum and Tuum, both in Tithes and in
Tributes; to show MARIESTY to Strangers, as it were Face to Face, in the Honor
of his Mints and glorious Exchange; maintains notwithstanding at his Staples a
frank and free Commerce for ready Gold and Silver, by the name of Bullion.

So that, as to see GOD in regard of Religion in the Glory of his Sanctuaries,
is to seek him in his Temples, and in the Beauty of his Holiness, to hear
him in his Churches Cathedrally: so to see the King in regard of his Justice,
in his Greatness and Honor, is to see him in his Courts Distributiuely, and
in the Bounty of his Bullion, by means of his Exchange, to seek him in his
Staples Commutatiuely. [Ignorance.] This indeed is something, and cannot be to
much, in regard of Kingly Bounty, except GOD may be to good; Which Piety dares
not think, nor profaneness speak: But what is this to our Religion? Since our
Temples stand upright, and our Churches move devotion; how come Customers thus
able to hunt after Popery, and see so far as ROME? [Customer.] Their standing
makes them see, and their seeing moves their Consciences not to hold their
peace. [Ignoranee.] What makes them diue so deep, and delue into the grounds
of Divinity and Humanity, to find out the Mysteries of Impiety and Iniquity,
in the Bowels of Popery? [Cust.] They seek for Truth and Goodness in Customs
and Subsidies, and serving GOD, and KINGS would gladly be happy.

[Ignorance.] As the Motyue and Occasion of Writing the MYSTERY of INIQVITY
grew first from the KINGS own commandment by Sir Alexander Hay upon his,
reading of the Preface to my former ACROAMATA, so the Declaration of the same,
falls out by this Account of a Customer of his own, to concern among OTHERS,
His Majesty's Own Self. For when the Jews of JERUSALEM, their Country being
subdued, and they paying Tribute unto CAESAR, came to live among the Romans, as
Freedenizons of ROME; Gentilisme and Iudaisme joining hands each with other,
Impiety and Iniquity committing Incest together, begat those two Monsters of
the World, the Idolatrous MASS, and profane VSVRY. Which by Bankers and Bawds
afterward corrupting true Religion and Justice both together, with the daily
love of Money (to keep down Christianity) so out-faced the Eucharist, and
scorned Exchange, that as Italy grew full of Bastard Interests, ROME it self
became the very Box of PANDORA, and Staple of Sin for Bullion to the
Catholic Disorder and Discord of all Churches of Christendom, and Christian
Commonwealths. The mischeefes whereof, by the pride of POPES and Popery,
though the Emperors and Publicans, did at first divide between them (for both
stood and fell together, with the ruin of the Empire) the Inconveniences at
last have extended so far, as to threaten KINGS anointed within their own
Kingdoms, and have cost some Kings their lives, by Jesuits and others. Have
not Customers then reason (in the Out-Portes at least) to look out and cry
alowd, Ab Jove Principium Reges? and to tell such to their faces, Quisque sitit
(REGIS) satiari sanguine NOSTRI*
Cum PAPA praeceps, Author and actor eat
Nam, Cui Religio Stuprum, ira, superbia, caedes,
Error, Mollities, Fulmina, turpe Lucrum,
Corpora qui vendit CHRISTI, Solumque Polu^que,
Caelestes Genios, Sydera, Iura, DEOS:
Fama refert, Scriptura docet, Peccata loquuntur
Huic, Huic, vita breuis, paena perennis erit.
Dictum puta* SCIOPPI.



But what have CUSTOMS and the Subsidies of Tonnage and Pondage to dislike of
in Popery? [Customer.] If MAJESTY must be seen, and SOVEREIGNTY subsist, as
in GOD, so in KINGS; what Adoration and Tithes are to God, the same are
Customs and Subsidies to Kings, his immediate Lieutenants, and beyond the
bounds that his Wisdom has laid out for the practice of his Truth; our
Discretion may hunt, but shall find naught but Error, what exceedes is but
Popery by Proiects to distract both Church, and disturb Commonwealth: for as
Omne minimum, is Inimica Naturae, so Omne Nimium vertitur in vitium; Enough
still makes a Feast, but abuses mar all, by means of POPES and Popery, as who
reads but our MYSTERY of INIQVITY, may plainly discern, and easily see,
here now to be declared. (...)

[Ignorance.] What has Italy to do with the MYSTERY of INIQVITY, and what
doubt you so from thence? [Customer.] Least the sowrenesse of their Grapes (I
mean her Imposts and Usury) should set men's teeth an edge, by her neerenesse
unto Rome, and make them drunk at last wthout the help of Messelto; I mean the
Grace of GOD. [Ignorance.] But let the Mass and Tithes alone, how has Rome
infected the Customs due to Kings, and offended Customers? [Customer.] By her
practice and Example. For even Rome her self, that from the bare command of
seven barren Hills, became Mistress and Empress at the last of all the World;
in her greatest height of Happiness, stood most of all assured, and constantly
settled, by her easy rates of Customs, and mildness of Customers, by the Name
of Publicans. Till Extremity began to teach all Men to Shift, whereby Shifts
incurd Suspicion, and Suspicion argued Ignorance, Ignorance brought forth
Errors, Errors turned to Mischeefes, and Mischeefes to Inconveniences, the high
way to Discord, Disorder, and Confusion. Whereby as Traffic grew confounded
both in Church and Commonwealth, offenses by consequence increast more and
more, which like to pudled Waters and corrupted Air, bred and engendered
nothing, but creeping Informens, noisome Caterpillars, and ravenous Harpies* to
vex and torment the Emperors themselves, and Empire withal: so that, When
Vtile had gotten the start of Honestum,
Couetise and Pride fell at odds each with other,
And Profit turning Private, made Honor seem nothing,
Where Honestum first, then Vtile, should have gone both together.


O ROME, therefore ROME! And must it be the lot of a Customer at last,
Ecclesiastical Popery by the Mass, sufficiently laid open by Divines: but
Secular Popery by Usury, never directly declared till now.
to lay open thy shame, and discover thine Iniquity before Emperors and Kings?
Thy Pride and Presumption in Coining of their Moneys? thy sale of Sin for
Bullion? thy Jewish Extortion and Baudry with Bankers, to draw home thy
Reuennewes? thy Rebellion? thy Popery? In a word, thy Usury the bane of their
Exchange? No marvel at all, seeing thy Couetise and Ambition in the greatness
of thy glory, made so slight account of Customers, and of their best Endeavors.
Witness the very Grauest-Wisest Senators that ever were begotten, bred, or
brought up, in thee, for thee, or by thee.

For what Man even at this day, that hears or reads thereof, admires not the
Greatness, and sometimes Happiness of the City it self of Rome? And in Rome
withal, the powerful Authority of Eloquence and Wisdom, of that Vere Pater
Patriae, MARCUS TVLLIVS CICERO?

ROMA autem, olim Imperij Domicilium, virtutis cumulo vel ipsis ATHENIS long
superior, and elocutionis laud par, aut paulo inferior; etiam-nunc hodie,
quamvis papistico luxu, and imperioso Christianismo, Bonorum omnium odio
subiecta sit: caeteris tamen omibus, CICERONIS Eloquentia and ingenio sic
posteritati co^mendata est; vt quandiu literarum latinarum vel fructu adiuti,
vel illustrati vlli extiterint; vrbis ROMae memoria, duratura est.

Now the whole Roman Commonwealth, even in their greatest Greatness,
consisted but of three Degrees or Orders. SENATORES, EQVITES, and PLEBIj;
Senators, Knights, and Plebians, or Commons. And in that of Knighthood, the
Publicans were chief by Tullies own words, thus pleading for Plancius.
Florem Ciuitatis, Ornamentum Imperij and Firmamentum Reipub: Publicanorum
Ordine contineri. And, Ad Quintu^ Fratrem, Si Publicanis aduersemur, Ordinem de
Nobis optime meritum, and per Nos cum Repub: coniunctum, a nobis and a Repub:
disiungimus: Glorying at it were in the mild disposition of the Customers in
his time, above those of other Countries, saying: Non esse leniores in tribu^is
exigendis Graecos, quam nostros Publicanos. Hinc enim est quod Caunij nuper ex
Insulis quae erant a Sylla Rhodijs attributae ad Senatum confugerunt, vt Nobis
potius vectigalia penderent quam Rhodijs. fimam tantum partem earum rerum quae
exportabantur, Portorij nomine (of Merchandise outward, by the Name of
Customs) and vectigalis (Merchandise Inward, called Jncomes and Reuennues)
wherein four things at this day are worthy to be noted. 1. The ordring
Traffic, into Outward and Inward. 2. The Distinguishing Tributes into
Customs, and Subsidies by the name of Reuennewes. 3. Their low and easy
Rates, in regard of other Countries. 4. And Protection and Direction of all
their Commerce, Senate, least one Man's will might be every Man's woe. But to
read his love to Customers, and withal, his care of the State, by beating
down so earnestly the strong conceits and forwardness of the wisest of those
times, that in favor of the Exchequer, sought to raise the Reuennewes, by
Vtile without Honestum, to make a Man in love with the Memory and Wisdom of
our late Lord Treasurer of England, within these fifty years: read in the third
Book of his Offices, his passionate speeches thus. Quousque tandem audebu^t
dicere quicquam vtile quod non prius Honestum? Nullam autem pestem maiorem
vitae and Societati hominum posse contingere dixerim, quam eorum opinio qui
ista distraxerint. Potest ne vlli Imperio, quod gloria and Sociorum
beneuolentia fultum esse debet, Vtile esse odium and infamia? Ego autem cum
Marco Catone meo sepe dissensi. Nimis enim praefracte and obstinate, Aerarium,
vectigaliaque visus est defendere, and Omnia Publicanis negare, cum quibus sic
agere vt cum Colonis deberemus, eoque magis, quod eius Ordinis coniunctio ad
salutem Reipub: apprime pertinet. Male item Curio causam transpadanam aequam
dicendo, semper addebat. VINCAT VTILITAS. Read him also, Ad Memmium. Epist. 10.
Terrentium Varronem, M: Bruto commendantem. Quod mature se contulerit in
Societatem Publicanorum; cuius ordinis mihi antea commendatissimi causa, fecit
amicitiam nostram multo firmiorem, and Epist. 7. ad Atticum. Caesari
amantissimos Publicanos aijt, Et homines amplissimos nominatim appellat. And
above all, to show his Judgment in Custom Causes, and acquaintance with
Customers; read him in Verrem. Lib. 3. de Jurisdiction Siciliensi, at these
words. Nam quod in Publicanorum Causis plurimum aetatis meae versor,
vehementerque illum Ordinem obseruo, satis commode mihi videor eorum
consuetudinem vsu, tractandoque cognovisse; But who reads the words
following, and observes his proceedings with LUCIUS VIBIVS, head Customer of
SYRACVSA, by the Books of his Accounts, to sift and spy out Verruvius, for
Verres would soon be persuaded, that even TVLLY himself had sometimes been
a Customer; so far of was he from thinking it a disparagement in credit, to
give his mind unto Customs, or disgrace to his person, to be acquainted with
Customers.

But howsoever. It is most apparent to such as list observe it, that if TVLLY
himself for all his wit and eloquence had not been studious to know the use
of Customs, and been conversant with Customers, he had never been able to
have left unto the World those two Golden works of his (the pledges of his
Loyalty, and Cream of his Judgment) called TVLLIES OFFICES, and
TVLLY-DE-REPVBLICA. The first, an Enchyridion of Honestum joined with Vtile,
teaching all Men even at this day, the true Rules of Ciuility and Christian
Policy. The other, likewise able to make any Man a Wiseman, in less then one
days reading, (as honest Roger Askam, and learned John Sturmius, did both
believe and write) if it were to be found. Much like perhaps our ALPHABET and
PRYMER, in the Amalthean Vatican of Sir THOMAS BODLEY at OXFORD, laid up
amongst others, though Cardinal Pooles 2000. Crowns mist it at Cracouia, when
writing into Poland he sent for it thither. [Igno.] Your reasons have won me to
conceive so well of Customs, that I am almost persuaded, by Tullyes Example, to
wish my self a Customer. [Customer.] No, no, not yet, reserve your self for
better Times and Place; for Times do alter, and we with the Times: yet, the
Bonds only excepted wherewith Customers are tide, and disgraces of their
Calling, I could wish not you only, but any Man besides, not almost, but
altogether a Customer, though but for three years. And for my part at least,
now after twenty years and more, so Traffic had her Staples, the King his
Bullion, and his Customers but their credit, The CVSTOMERS extraordinary zeal
to his COUNTRIES Prosperity, and SOVEREIGNS settled Happiness.
that their Functions do require: I would willingly resign my Patent and my
Place, and in this kind become more unhappy then my Fellows. But so it is and
must be, till Truth be better known, which Experience will lay open; For if
our foresaid L. Treasurer, or the same Marcus Tullius Cicero, that out of zeal
unto his Country, fell out with Marcus Cato, his nearest dearest Friend, in
defense of Customers, were now to plead their cases, he might well deplore
their States, but would hardly be a Customer, in the Out-Ports at least. Or if
Saint Matthew himself, that sometimes was a Customer, were now again alive, he
might wonder to see, that it would not be enough to be an honest Man, no not a
Christian, were he Kentish bred and borne, if the Name of a Customer were once
but cast upon him.

But o those Asian wars, above all that has been spoken by Marcus Aurelius,
so feelingly deplored, and wisely set down, fatal both to Publicans, together
with the Emperors, and the Empire of Rome, and other Kings and Kingdoms, with
their Customers and Customs. For the Truth indeed is this, As M. Aurelius
shows plainly, how the Conquest of Asia laid the foundation of the Romain
Empires fatal ruin, by transporting Jewish Usury (with other Sins and Vices)
from JERUSALEM to ROME: so read in the Mystery of Iniquity, what England
gained, and Edward the third got in belaying the Conquest of France at so high
a rate, as the loss of all his Staples, for passage only through Flanders
thither: namely, by transplanting the Staple of Kent first from Sandwich to
Bruges, for fifteen years: and after, from Canterbury to Calis; whereby, as
first the Golden fleeces of England, became the Trophies of Burgundy, and so
continues: so after, as our Mines were transported, our Mints and Customs
followed (for shadows by Nature, must move with their Bodies) and England
forced by Statutes, to draw over her Moneys still from Callis, having lost both
her Mints and Mines at home.

But with the loss of Callis, how our Staples and our Traffic in the
Netherlands, (neither fixed nor well used, but wandering up and down) maintained
tumultuous wa^es there, for fifty years and more, and by warming their blood
still, strau'd our own at home; Experience best can tell.


that after IVDEA by Conquest subdued, was made a Province to the Empire, and
JERUSALEM it self became subject to ROME, amongst many other enormities which
those Wars did beget; Customs turned to Subsidies, and Subsidies into Taxes,
Imposts and Impositions, out of Jealousy, suspicion, Couetise, and Pride;
Customs, by Searchers and Informers, were made curses of Divine Justice, to
keep the Jews under, who in respect of themselves, called all the World
Gentiles, and having lost their former freedom, in hatred of their Tributes,
seeing Searchers now and Customers live still together, held Customers for
Ethnickes, and Searchers greatest Sinners, by the name of Publicans, for that
encluded either, as well those of themselves, as sent thither from Rome;
namely, Saint Matthew, and Zacheus. And as their Adjuncts then, called Socij,
Predes and Mancipes, like Comptrollers, Surueyers, and Searchers now,
pretending all Tributes (which Tully called Aurum Iudaicum) but entending most
themselves, being accomptable for nothing, were at all hands called Publicans
Cathexochen; so now, and at this day be the Sinners, who shall, will, or can;
the Customers name and person bears all the blame, as the Customs cover all,
because Customers are not trusted, nor the Customs rightly known. And as after
Tully all dissolved into Farms, Publicans being Farmers, and Adjuncts with
others; even Publicans became Farmers and Publicans to, which by the Grace of
GOD I never mean to do. [Ignorance.] Are Customs then Duties of so great
import, as you set them forth? I pray you for my learning describe them unto
me, and show me what they be, since Impostes, Impositions, and Subsidies to,
are all styled Customs. [Customer.] Customs of themselves, and properly
taken, are but small and easy payments of ready current Money, by Merchants,
Subjects, or Strangers, for such Stapled Commodities, as for Art as well as
Nature, being orderly bought and sold, and for Number, Weight, and Measure,
sufficiently censured, with the Kings and Staple Seals, and special
Certificats to Customers at their Ports come warranted thither, for our
Sovereigns only Homage, as Lord of all the Fee, before they cross the Seas,
and our Countries credit. Whereby you may perceive how all our happiness, for
Matter, Persons, Place, Order, and End, concur in this one word [Customes]
and how our Customs including our Sovereigns Honor, and Subjects Wealth, that
Honestum and Vtile may still go together; do presuppose Money. Now Money
points at Mints, Mints work by Bullion, and Bullion argues Mines, Artificial
or Natural. But Mines by Nature, as England never had, her Mines Artificial
have ever been her Staples, where her Load-stones were preserved, whose
virtues still attractiue by the benefit of Traffic, afford more Gold and
Silver, then the Mines of the World; so that, thus still in England the case
has ever stood. Without Staples, no Elixars nor Loadstones at all: No
Loadstones, no Bullion: No Bullion, no Mints: No Mints, no Money: and no Money,
no Customs: Which being but compared to Quitrents or Tithes, are conuertible,
or reciproke and conclude in this wise. As no Quitrents know no Manors; and no
Tithes, no Churches: so no Customs, no Staples: and no Staples, no Customs:
and so by consequence no orderly Traffic, or no Traffic at all. Now if
Traffic either fail, or be any ways disturbed; how shall MAJESTY be seen,
or avoid at the least to be dangerously eclipsed? And how shall SOVERAIGNT
subsist? And if both of these two fail, for they stand and fall together; How
shall Subjects ever look or hope to be happy? [Ignorance.] I see and perceive
that Customs grows from Staples by Traffic, as Honey does from Bees in
Hiues. But how does Traffic depend and subsist by Staples so needfully.
[Customer.] As Religion does by Temples, and Justice by her Courts
Distributiuely, for even Justice Commutatiue, is the same we call Traffic.

I know there are sundry that ween themselves wise, who by mere speculation
pretending love to Traffic, cry out against our Staples for fear of our
shipping. And some that hold Temples to be needless for Religion, thinking if
al Creekes were Head-Ports, without Limb or Member, it were happy for
Traffic; as if the cherishing of Oaks were the way to hinder Timber, and
spoil all our Trees, and the raising of our Hiues again, were to spill all
our Honey, and smother all our Bees. Or as if our stateliest Byshopprickes might
well be discharged by poor Scholars and Clarks, and our skilfulst Roads and
Havens, were fit for no shipping but Boats and small Barks. But send such to
Antycira to purge their frantic folly. Customers, by reason and Religion
both, rejoice in their hearts to see GOD in his Temples, the Beauty of his
Holiness Cathedrallie: and in regard of their Customs, wish to see the KING
in the Seats of his Honor Commutatiuely, by crying still for Staples.

That as GOD by his Goodness and Truth does direct us,
whose Mercy endures for ever:
And his love with his favor, seems still to protect us,
for his Mercy endures for ever.
So our Traffic by Staples in temper again,
since his Mercy endures for ever:
Our Ports with their Customs might chant it amain,
that his Mercy endures for ever.
[Ignorance.] It seems you live in hope still, to find out your Customs, and
so to be happy. [Customer.] In working thus alone, Quo fato quidem nescio, sed
non fine Numine, as my hope and comfort is, since Goodness calls me forward, I
have cause to be weary, and am almost tired; yet I cannot despair in regard
of Religion, whose Temples upright, still make her to flourish: And serving at
the Altar, if I may but live thereby, I shall hold out the better. For when all
Churches were infected with the Arrian Heresy, none stood for Truth but
ATHANASIVS all alone; the World against Him, and He against the World, with the
Emperors displeasure, and hazard of his life, whose Doctrine notwithstanding,
is a part of our Lyturgie, and now taught for our Creed; such is the power of
constancy and Truth. And there was a time likewise, when the whole Christian
World was all set on fire, kindled by disputes, and distracted by opinions,
about the Head of the Church Militant, Apostolikely Catholic, and some points
of Religion, wherein Truth found few favorers and unfeigned friends indeed, but
the zealous endeavors of an humble minded Friar, LVTHER.
and who could then have thought, or any ways believed, that against such
mighty enemies and strong oppositions, so weak a Man and means should ever have
prevailed; but Magna semper veritas, preualuit and preualebit: to GODS eternal
Glory, our Neighbors daily comfort, and our Kingdoms Happiness, above al parts
of the World, either public or private. And does not the like even now (I say
now) by the Truce in the Netherlands, offer it self in Justice, to help us
again to our own Home-borne, Freeborn Traffic, that cries but for
passage, and desires to be relieved from the Pride of Anwarpe, the Ingratitude
of Bruges, from the Taxes of Flanders, Impostes of Italy, and Embargoes of
Spain?

What though those Works and nine books of SIBYLS (whereof three were dearly

and carefully preserved by Tarquine the elder) be all burnt up and gone, by
Stillico that Traitor?

Ne tantum Patrijs saeuiret Proditor Armis,
Sancta Sybillinae fata cremauit Opis.
We have the BIBLE and NEVV-TESTAMENT, that alone and of themselves are able
and sufficient to show the way to happiness to all that are not obstinate, and
despise their own salvation. Besides nine works yet extant of a Customers
best endeavors, as fit for our purpose perhaps, as those were.

Yea, what though that Heathens AGROAMATA of Kingly Doctrine, so gravely
discust, and attentively heard, were so richly rewarded, with Talents of Gold,
and ours not regarded? Non est mortale quod opto.

Nay, what though, even TVLLY-DE-REPVBLICA (which, learned men so wish for, and
Cardinal POOLE so sought for, even with the loss of all his Crowns) be held
for forlorn, and no where to be found? Our ALPHABET is extant (as fit for
Great Britain as that for the Romans) and of all to be seen in the Amalthaean
Vatican of our late TARQVINIVS PRISCVS, Sir Thomas Bodlies Library at Oxford.
whose Care and Love to lerning in the Kingdom of the Muses, deserves a golden
Crown. And this is more my comfort. The light all they saw by, were but
Glimses of the beams of our most glorious SON. Their best Enthusiasmes, were
but motions to Honesty, from the full and free Infusions of the SPIRIT of
adoption, that sanctifies all our wits, blesses our endeavors, and illustrates
my Theme. And their clearest waters but borrowed from the streams of that
euer-flowing FOVNTAINE, that runs so frankely, and serves our turns so well.
Besides, the true Christian Catholic Religion takes my part, whereof they
could not tell.

For this our Traffic, being nothing else but a frank and free-barring of one
good thing for another, or a buying and selling of Vendible Wares for ready
Gold and Silver between Subjects and Allies, at Places convenient, according
to the Rules of reciproke Commerce, generally intending al Honor unto Kings,
and all Wealth to Commonweals, does plainly lay open unto such as list
observe them, all those five Vowelles in twice five substantial words, that
makes us all to speak both for 1. Matters. u. u. KING and PRINCE.

But that which joys me most, and reuiues my Spirits withal, is this. This
points to a Parliament, which Customers wish and hope for (yet in very good
time) for the KINGS fixed Honor, and States prosperity, howsoever Guilt, Fear,
or Ignorance seem to doubt or diswade it.
When CASTOR came alone to the top of our Mast, and POLLVX did but follow, I
had cause to doubt the weather; but now CASTOR and POLLVX, the Gods of our
Seas, that are able and powerful to warrant our Traffic, coming both again
together, do boade us all good luck; for the Wind turned North, shows the
storms almost gone; and skilful PALINVRVS coming now to Port or Helm,
observes himself our Compass, (bid Merchants stands by) and gives both
hope and comfort of attaining at last, to our long desired Port that is now
within a kenning, for the forelands apear. And our Bark is strong enough to
bear out all our Leakes: therefore be of good cheer, Saint George
heretofore, now GOD and CHRIST to borrow. Our Loadstones prove as good as ever
they were, and our Compass is true, therefore bear aloof but a while, for fear
of the Goodwines, by the cape of good hope, to the Island of Exchange, the
Haven of all safety, and Port of Peace and R^st, where Bounty now commands:
For Reliquis tantum sinus est and statio malefida carinis.

But admit all this were nothing, which by way of Account has been hitherto
set down, or a Paradox at least. Mine APOLOGY but Humor; my REPLY a Conceit;
mine ALPHABET, a Dream; and my MYSTERY, but a lest, because a Customer only
speaks: yet if this be but believed, that Truth tells Sense and Reason, and
Goodness does suggest; namely, that look what the Soul is to the actions of
the body in ordering Members so, as to Nature seems fit, for the good of the
whole Man: the same is Traffic, in disposing Mysteries and Trades, to the
benefit and behoof of the whole Commonweal; though our ISIS be gone, and no
Image of her face, yet Aegeus our DAY STAR being risen in her place, and his
hopeful THESEUS like the DAWNING of all Grace apearing in our eyes, so reuiues
my dull SPIRITS, that I cannot despair, but live still in hope that the time
may yet come, when this hearty zeal of mine, to my Sovereigns Honor, and
Subjects Wealth, may be better regarded, and deserve not only thanks and good
words, but make all men confess ( Merchants at lest) to owe as much to these
my weak endeauours (if Traffic may be valued) I say not as one Staple, one
Mint, one Port, one Town, or one City of LONDON; but many Staples, many Mints,
many Ports, many Towns, and many Cities like LONDON, and all their Wealth is
worth. Some few, private, particular, and preventing persons excepted, of whom
I look for no thanks, nor seek any favor.

Here then to conclude and close up this Account, the sum of all is this:
Since all Men by Nature desire to be happy, and Customers with the rest, whose
silence pleads for them by signs with their Pens, though themselves dare not
speak. For Assai domanda eneor che may non grida chi ben seruendo tace: there
are but two ways that lead to Felicity, Religion and Justice, and Traffic
encludes either; the zeal whereof only has prevented all my studies, almost
consumed my self, and yet is the Motive of all my best endeavors.

For my Countries sake therefore, in regard of public good, Summa Totalis.
and for no side respects, in beating out the way that leads unto Happiness,
as I have not bin idle, and have not held my peace: so now for my Sovereigns
sake, KING JAMES and his Posterity, as by Oath I am bound, in regard of his
Bullion, for that is his right, and no Man's but his, by the Rules of Fixed
Goodness. In regard of his Mints, for that is his Honor, and no Man's but his,
by the Rules of Justice: In regard of his Exchange, for that is his Glory, and
no Man's but his, by the Rules of Equity: And lastly, for his Customs, in
regard of his Homage, for that is his profit, and no Man's but his, by the Rules
of Meum and Tuum, as in Tithes, so in Tributes, that Honestum and Vtile may go
orderly together; Honestum and Vtile.
my Conscience cannot rest, but wish the return of our
HOME-BORNE-FREE-BORNE-TRAFFIQVE, at home again in peace.

And why should I despair, since as Religion has her Temples, so Justice has
her Courts distributiuelie, whereby Truth with the time appears to prevail?
And for Traffic at Staples by Nature still admirable, and by Art made amiable,
by Degrees and Proportions, of Good, Better, Best, in Number, Weight, and
Measure, what can be less spoken then a Customer has said? The Customers
zeal to the Honor and Happiness of Kings and Counsaile-Tables, by Traffic.
Namely, that her Doctrine is heavenly, and no ways fit for Emperickes, but
KINGS and COVNCELL-TABLES. Her Seat and Residence the SOVEREIGNS own bosom.
Her voice well tunde, the Harmony of Christian Kingdoms. To whom Courts and
Countries owe Fealty and Homage; the Meanest Subjects still feeling her Care,
and the Greatest PRINCES still subject to her Providence. And whom, both NOBLE
and Ignoble admire and love; as Norice and Prote^^rice of all their earthly
Happiness, Prosperities, PEACE, and Joy. Ab Jove principium (Reges and
Consules ergo) Iouis omnia plena. GOD has begun his part, by means of the
Eucharict, let Kings and Counsels follow, by restoring their Exchange, that
Usury with the Mass may be packt away for Rome, where Popery missing MAJESTY
for want of Goodness, and SOVEREIGNTY finding no place nor means to subsist,
for want of Truth; the POPE with his Cardinals and Jesuits each with other,
may hide them in Vtopia, The Customers Resolution.
or Purgatory, choose whether, whilst Catholics and Christians, and Customers
altogether, resolve in their hearts to do their best endeavors, To find and
hold fast Innocence, and take heed to that is right; for that at the last, and
nothing else, brings Summa Summarum and all to perfect Happiness: SVMMA
SVMMARVM.
in one word to [PEACE.]

His Confession*
Now GOD from whom all Holy thoughts, and best endeavors grow,
Make me possess that perfect PEACE the World cannot bestow:
And that which of my self I can by Merits no way gain,
Grant that thy GRACE by Faith and Works may help me to obtain.
His Prayer and Thanksgiving. Psalm. 4.
O GOD. that art my righteousness, Lord hear me when I call,
Thou have set me at liberty, when I was bond and thrall:
Have mercy Lord therefore on me, and grant me my request,
For unto thee incessantly, to cry I will not rest.
O Mortal Men how long will ye, the Glory nf God despise?
Why wander ye in vanity, and follow after lies?
Know ye that good and godly Men, the Lord does take and choose,
And when to him I make my plaint, he does not me refuse.
Sin not but stand in awe therefore, examine well your heart,
And in your Chambers quietly, see you your selves convert.
The Greater Sort crave worldly goods, and Riches do embrace,
But Lord grant me thy countenance, thy favor and thy Grace:
For thou thereby shall make my heart, more joyful and more glad,
Then they that of their SILKS and WINE, so great increase have had.
In PEACE therefore lie down will I, taking my rest and sleep, His
QVIETVS-EST.

For thou alone wilt me (O Lord) always in safety keep.

whole Account.

Goodness from GOD, and Bounty from KINGS, to make All in All, Happy.

Let TRAFFIQVE be relieved,
Of GOODNESS long depreeued,
