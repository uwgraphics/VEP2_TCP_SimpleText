AN ACCOUNT Of the MOUEMENTS of Their Majesty's Royal Fleet, With other
Occurrences.
In a Letter from Falmouth, July the 6th. LICENSED, July 10th. 1691.
SIR,
ON Saturday last, about Six in the Evening, there came into Our Port, Their
Majesty's Ship the Grey-boned, from the Royal Fleet; whom she left the Day
before, about Four in the Afternoon, between Scilly and Vshant: They give an
Account, That the Admiral, with the English and Dutch Fleet, just as they came
away, was resolved immediately to stand over for the Coast of Ireland, in
search after the French Fleet; whom they had an Account, was Sailed toward the
Irish Coast. The Captain of the Greyhound, has sent his Longboat on Shore, to
take in Letters here for the Admiral and Fleet.

This Morning came into this Harbor, one of our Tin Vessels from Spitt-head;
the Master thereof gives an Account, That he came out from Spitt-head, in
Company of Two Dutchmen of War, each carrying Seventy Guns, very stout Ships,
and excellently well Manned: These two Ships they parted Company with, just off
of our Coast; they pursuing their Voyage, in order to join the Royal Fleet.

The Convoy, with the Barbadoes-Fleet, mentioned in my last, continue still
Here.

Our Seamen on Board, (as the Greyhound Men gives us an Account of) being all
very well, and in excellent Heart, desire nothing more, than to meet the French.

Yesterday the Wind was at North-West, and this day it is at South-West, an
indifferent good Gale, and Fair Weather. This is what offers at present from.

Yours, etc.
