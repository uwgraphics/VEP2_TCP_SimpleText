ANIMADVERSIONS Upon some passages in a Paper, Entitled, Some Reasons HUMBLY
OFFERED Why the QUAKERS Should be Examined.
By Edmund Elys.
THe Author of this Paper says, That the Quakers Differ from the Christians as
much, if not more than the Jews. I really Pity this Wretched SLANDEROUS Person.
And I Aver to all the World, that whosoever, Professing himself to be a
Christian, peremptorily, and obstinately Denies that JESUS CHRIST is the
Fountain of LIGHT in the Souls of Men, is worse than a Jew. He produces this
Principle of the Quakers as Dangerous to the Civil Government, viz. That their
Light within is the Higher Power, to which Every Soul ought to be Subject.

Answ. Their Light within, i. e. the True Light, which they Acknowledge to
Enlighten Every Man, and Own as Their Principal TEACHER, is The King of Kings,
and Lord of Lords: To Him Alone we Owe ABSOLUTE Obedience: Our Obedience to
Earthly Princes ought to be Regulated by the Knowledge we have of His Will
Revealed in the Holy Scriptures, which we cannot Effectualy Understand, but
only by Receiving the Illuminations, and Impressions, or Motions, which come
IMMEDIATELY from HIM, Who is always as realy PRESENT to our Souls, as the Light
of the Sun when it shines upon us, is Present to the Eyes of our Bodies. I
doubt not but Thousands, and Ten Thousands, who have little, or no Explicit
Understanding of what I Mean by these words, do usually, or Habitually Order
their Conversation according to the Truth, which I here Endeavor to Express.

At this Yearly Meeting, says he, they virtually (though not verbally) Repeal
such Parts, or Branches of the Laws, as do not Quadrate with their Light
within, and thereby absolve the King's Subjects (if the Quakers may be called
such) from their Active Obedience to the Laws of the Land; thereby causing them
to adhere to a Superior Power to that of King, Lords, and Commons; namely to
their Light within, to which, they say, all Power in Heaven and Earth is
Committed.

Answ. Their Light Within is The Everlasting SON of the FATHER, LIGHT OF LIGHT,
The True Light which Enlighteneth Every Man that comes into the World: To HIM,
as Made Man, all Power in Heaven, and Earth is Committed for the Execution of
the Office of the MEDIATOR between GOD and Man. Most certainly His Power is
Infinitely Superior to that of King, Lords and Commons: But it is an Act of
Disobedience to Him to Refuse our Active Obedience to any Law of the Land,
which we Know, or may easily Know that we may Observe without any Repugnancie
to the Will of GOD Revealed in the Holy Scriptures. He says the Quakers call
the Presbyterians, Independents, and Anabaptists An Ill Pedantick Crew, the
Bane of Religion, and Pest of the World, the Old Incendaries to Mischief.

Answ. Those Presbyterians, and Independents deserve that Black Character, who
Justify those Execrable Sayings that have been Published By GEORGE TROSSE, and
JOHN FLAVEL, Two Nonconformist Preachers of Equal Boldness, and Ignorance. I
desire the Prayers of all Persons that have an Habitual Aversion from All Known
Sin, that I may be Faithful unto Death in the Defense of this Truth, that JESUS
CHRIST is the Fountain of Light In the Souls of Men.
