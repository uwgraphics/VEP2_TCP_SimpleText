A PATTERN of true LOVE to you I will recite.
Between a Beautiful Lady and a Courtious Knight.

To the Tune of, Dainty come thou to me, etc.
Licensd and Entered according to Order.





DEar Love regard my grief,
do not my suit disdain,
O yield me some relief,
that am with sorrow slain:
These long seven years and more
have I still loved thee,
Do thou my ioys restore,
fair Lady pity me.
Pity my grievous pain.
long suffered for thy sake,
Do not my suit disdain,
that no time rest can take;
These seven long years and more.
have I still loved thee:
Do thou my joys restore
fair Lady pity me.
How should I pity thee?
this Lady then replied,
Thou art no match for me,
thy suit must be denied:
I am of noble blood,
you but of mean degree,
It stands not for my good
f^^^ly to match with th^e
This answer had he most,
which cut his heart so deep,
That on his bed full often
would he lie down and weep,
With tears he did lament
his froward destiny;
With sights yet would be say,
Fair Lady pity me.
While I live, I must love,
so fancy urges me,
My mind cannot remove,
such is my constancy:
My mind is nobly bent
though I of low degree,
Sweet Lady give consent
to love and pity me.
The Lady hearing now
the moan that he did make,
Did of his suit allow,
and thus to him she spak,
Ser Knight, mourn thou no more,
my faith I plight to thee,
May this thy joys restore,
thou have thy wish of me,


But first sweet Love (quoth she)
what shift then will thou make,
With speed to marry me,
and thy delight to take:
It were a bargain bad
to get a wanton Wife,
And lose with sorrow great
thy sweet distressed life.
If that my Father knew
the love I bear to thee,
We both the same should rue,
therefore be ruled by me:
When my Father is in bed
and all his waiting-men,
Throught the window will I get
see that you meet me then.
Content Lady, (he said):
he is but a Coward knight
Whom ought shall make afraid
to win a Lady bright:
Thus then they went away
but by the master-cook
Coming thought the window wide,
was this fair Lady took.
O gentle cook, (quothshe)
do not my deed bewray.
Some favor to me show
and let me pass away:
Love that does conquer Kings
forced me to do this deed,
VVilst others sits and sings
make not my heart to bleed
Not so, (then said the cook)
fair Lady pardon me,
Who can this trespass brook,
committed thus by thee:
My Lord, your Father shall
the matter understand,
For false I will not be,
neither for house nor land.
Then from the Lady's face,
fell down the tears amain
She was in woeful case
and thus she made her moan:
Ah, my own dear Love,
little know thou my grief,
Great sorrows must we prove,
hope yielding no relief.
Her Father in a spleen,
locked up his Daughter bright
And sent forth armed men
to take this worthy Knight.
Who then was judged to be
quite banished from the land.
Never his Love to see
so strict was the command.
And at the sessions next,
after the Knight was gone,
To his Daughter, full of woe,
they brought a ^anged man,
Whose head was smitten off,
the Maiden's truth to prove,
Quoth her Father, VVanton Dam^
now take thee here thy Love.
Her tears fell down amain,
when this sight she did see
And sorely did complain
of Father's cruelty*
His body she did wash
with tears that she did shed,
An hundree times she kissed
his body being dead.
Alas, my Love, (she said)
dear have thou paid for me.
Would God in heaven's bliss,
my soul were onw with thee
But whilst that I do live,
a vow I here do make,
Seven years to live unwed
for my true Lover's sake
Her Father hearing this,
was grieved inwardly,
He pardoned her amiss,
and praised her con^^ancy:
And to this courteous Knight,
her Father did her wed.
God grant the like suc^ess:
where perfect love is breed.
FINIS.
