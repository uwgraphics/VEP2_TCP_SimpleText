(...) isbury Assizes. (...)ard of Witchcraft.
Being a true Relation of one Mistress Bodnan living in Fisherton, next house
but one to the Gallows, who being a Witch seduced a Maid, called by name, Anne
Styles, to the same abominable and detested action of VVitchcraft; which VVitch
for that action was executed the 19 day of March 1653.

To ^he tune of Bragandary,




WHen men and Women leave the way
of God, and goodness quite,
They practice mischief every day
and therein take delight
The Devil then is nigh at hand
When these things he does understand,
You that will go,
High or low
Resolve upon this doubt.
As by the Story you shall hear
if you will list a while
The Devil lately did appear;
and a Woman did beguile
But she did make the way before,
And in her heart did him adore
You that will go, etc.
In Fisherton this dame did dwell
of conversation bad
She did converse with the Devil of Hell,
which made her friends all sad,
Unto the Devil she gave her soul
Sealed in a bloody serouls,
You that will go, etc.
Mistress Rodnam was her name,
who daily undertooks
To help men to stolen goods again,
even with her cunjuring book
A looking glass she had likewise,
To show the Thieves before their eyes
You that will go, etc.
Among the rest a Maid then went,
her name was Annis Styles
About stolen goods in discontent
but the Divill her beguiles
The Divill did the Witch persuade
For to seduce this silly maid
You that will go, etc.
She gave the Maid a Looking glass
on which she looked on
But at the length it came to pas
she was to soon undone,
For want of wisdom and true grace,
She was undone in little space,
You that will go, etc.
Sweet heart quoth she if that you please,
I will teach you my art,
So you may live in wealth and ease
according to your heart
If you your Soul the Devil will give
In health and wealth you then may live,
You that will go, etc.
To soon alas she did consent
and sealed it with her blood,
Which made her afterward repent,
when as she understood
That she must loose the joys of heaven
For some Toys unto her given
You that will go,
High or low,
Resolve upon this doubt.
(...) part
to the same tune.


AT length it came for to be known,
how she had simply run
Then to the Witch she made her moan.
and said she was undone
She said to London she would fly,
For fear least both of them should dye,
You that will go
High or low,
Resolve upon this doubt.
The Witch was willing there unto,
and bid her fly with speed
She was at Stockbridge taken though,
for that notorious deed,
The Divill cast her to and froe
As all the company did know
You that will go, etc,
When in the chamber she came in,
the Devil tossed her about
She asked the devil where heed bin
to give her such a floute,
Then all the standers by amazed,
Upon each other then they gazed,
You that will go, etc,
A Gentleman great pains did take,
with her the people say,
And she to him her mind did break
and for her he did pray,
She told him the old witch was cause
That she had broke Gods holy laws
You that will go, etc.
Four days together she was vexed
tormented ^rieviously
And in her mind was sore perplex^
that some thought she would (...)
The Devil like a Snake apeard
Which all the country people feared
You that will go, etc,
But when the old Witch came in sight,
then did she take her rest,
And she did sleep well all that night
as plainly is expressed,
She said when as she walked again,
She praised God she felt no pain
You that will go, etc.
She told the Gentleman that she
would tell him all her art
And that he should enriched be
by what she should impart
She told him that she knew full well,
She should be a great Lady in hell,
You that will go, etc.
The old Witch executed was,
this month the 19. day,
She ever had a face of Bras
as all the people say,
Instead of pensiveness and prayer
She did naught but curse and swear,
You that will go, etc,
God nothing had to do with her
she said most desperately
She swore and cursed and kept a (...)
and desperately did dye
Let all good people therefore say
(...) hearts with me and pray,
(...) go (...)
