ACT for well Governing and Regulating Corporations.
Paragraph XII. PRovided also, and be it Enacted, by the Authority aforesaid,
That from and after the expiration of the said Commissions, no Person or
Persons shall for ever hereafter be Placed, Elected, or Chosen, in or to any of
the Offices and Places aforesaid that shall not have within one Year next
before such Election or Choice, taken the Sacrament of the LORDS SUPPER,
according to the Rites of the Church of England, etc. (and in Default thereof
such Election to be void, etc.)
Be this Paragraph understood as variously as men's minds can mould it, Yet is
it very important for those shall choose men into Offices and Places, in the
Act mentioned, To consider, England, and their Election thereby becoming void,
Ought in Reason and good Conscience, to be Elected into any Office or Place
again, because they seem to become Qualified by having Since taken the
Sacrament of the LORDS SUPPER, according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the
Church of England, which is in effect, but a prostitution of that Holy
Ordinance to the corrupt Designs, perhaps of men's Interests and Passions. And
if the Parties hoping to be Elected, should be disappointed, the only Searcher
of hearts can tell, if they may not Repent of having done that Duty.
