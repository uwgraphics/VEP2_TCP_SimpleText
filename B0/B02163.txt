To his Grace, His Majesty's high Commissioner, and the Right Honorable the
Estates of Parliament.
The humble Petition of Sir William Campbell.
Shows,
That your petitioner has walked these many years betwixt England and
Scotland, living upon Charity, as is well known to His Majesty's secretary, and
many others of this Honorable Assembly: And having now in his old age, not
being able to Travel any more, taken himself to a Married Life, of purpose to
get rest in his old Age: But by providence being redacted to Poverty, has
nothing to maintain Himself and his Wife, he has row Married, being a poor
Widow, the Relict of a Presbyterian Minister at Dornock.

It is therefore humbly craved your Grace, and Estates of Parliament, would out
of Pity and Compassion, seriously consider an old Gentleman's condition, who
never prejudged neither Church nor State, but kept himself as a Christian, though
surprised by his Opposers; and in the last Government innocently put in Prison,
and a Goad of Iron put upon his Legs, which is well known to many, and was
called a Cheat and a Rogue, which he resented; and as many knows he was
innocent: and allow him an yearly allowance during his life, for his
maintenance. And this is the request of him, that will pray God to prosper His
Majesty, and all His Forces by Sea and Land. God bless the Honorable
Parliament, and grant you may do nothing, but what may tend to GOD'S glory, and
the Nations good: And your Answer.

If my request you do not grant,
Your Money must be very scant:
For as I live, I nothing crave
But Charity, which I must have
For to supply my present need,
Which I pray God you will do with speed.
God bless you all, both great and small,
And so farewell onto you all.

AMEN.
