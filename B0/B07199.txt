These gates be shytso wonderly well
That we may not come here in
Than spoke clymme of the cloughe
With a wyle we will us in bring
Let us say we be messengers
Straight comen from our king
Adam said I have a lettre written well
Now let us wisely work
We will say we have the kings seal
I hold the porter no clerk
Than adam bell beat on the gate
With strokes great and strong
The porter herd such noise therate
And to the gate fa^^e he thronge
Who is there now said the porter
That makes all this knocking
We be two messengers said clymme of the clo^
Be comen straight from our king
We have a lettre said adam bell
To the Justice we must it bring
Let us in our message to do
That we were again to our king

The market place of merry carlyll
They beset in that stounde
And as they looked them beside
A pair of new galowes there they se
And the justice with a quest of swerers
That had iuged clowdysle there hanged to be
And clowdysle himself lay ready in a carte
Fall ^ounde both foot and hand
And a strong rope about his neck
All ready for to be hangde
The justice called to him a sad
Clowdysles clothes should he have
To take the mesure of that good yoman
And thereafter to make his grave
I have seen as great a merueyll said clowdy,
As between this and pryme
He th^^ makes this grave for me
Hymse^fe may lie therein
Thou spekest proudely said the justice
I shall hang the with my hand
Full well that herd his brethren two
There still as the did stand
Than clowdysle cast his eyes asyd^
And saw his two brethren stand
At a corner of the market place
With their good bows bente in their hand
Ready the justice for to chase
I se good comfort said clowdysle
Yet hope I well to fare

(...)l ye find by me
(...)ell in that tide
For their strings were of sy^^e full sure
That they kept the streets on every side
That battle did long endure
They fought together as brethren true
Like hardy men and bold
Many a man to the ground they threw
And made many an heart cold
But when their arowes were all gone
Men presyd on them full fast
They drew their swerdes than anon
And their bows from them cast
They went lightly on their way
With swerdes and buckelers round
By that it was the mids of the day
They had made many a wound
There was many an out horn in carlyll ^^owen
And the belles backwarde did they ring
Many a woman said alas
And many their hands did wrynge
The mayre of carlyll forth come was
And with him a full great route
These three yomen dredde him full sore
For their lives stood in doubt
The mayre came armed a full great pace
With a polaxe in his hand
Many a strong man with him was
There in that stoure to stand
The mayre smote at clowdysle with his byll
His buckeler he brast in two
Full many a yoman with great ill
(...)s treason they cried for woe
(...)e w^the gates fast they bad
(...)t these traitors theroute not go
^ur all for naught was that they wrought
For so ^^st they down were laid
Till they all three that so manfully fought
Were gotten without at a brayde
Have here your keys said adam bell
Mine offy^^ I here forsake
If ye do by my council
A new porter ye make
He threw the keys there at their hedes
And bad them evil to thryue
And all that lets any good yoman
To come and comfort his wyue
Thus (...) good yomen gone to the wode
As light as ^efe on lynde
They laughe and be mercy in their mode
Their enemies were far behind
When they came to Inglyswode
Under their trysty tree
There they found bows full good
And arowes great plente
So help me god said adam bell
