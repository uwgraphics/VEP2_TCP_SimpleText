The Bulls Feather;
BEING The Good-fellows Song, usually sung at their Merry-Meeting in Bulls
Feather-Hall, who sent this Song to their Brethren, (of what degree or quality)
in praise of the Bulls Feather. And to all merry Cuckolds who think it no
scorn, To wear the Bulls Feather, though made of a Horn.

To a very pleasant new Tune: Or: The Bulls Feathers




I I chanced not long ago,
as I was walking,
An Echo did bring me, where
two were a talking:
'Twas a Man said to his Wife,
dye had I rather,
Then to be Cornuted, and
wear the Bulls Feather.
Then presently she replied,
sweet, art thou jealous?
Thou can not play Vulcan,
before thou play Venus:
Thy Fancies are foolish, such
fo^ies to gather,
For there is many an honest man,
wears the Bulls Feather.
Though it be invisible,
let no man it scorn,
Being it is a New Feather,
made of an old Horn:
He that disdains it, in
mind or in heart either,
May be the more subject
to wear the Bulls Feather.
He that lives discontented,
or in despair,
And fears false measure,
because his Wife's fair:
His thoughts are inconstant,
much like Winter weather,
Though one or two want it,
he shall have a Feather.




BUlls Feathers are common,
as Ergo in the Schools,
And only Contemned by
those that are fools:
Why should a Bulls Feather
cause any unrest,
Since Neighbors fair always,
is counted the best:
Those Women who are fairest,
are likest to give it,
And Husbands that have them,
are apt to believe it:
Some men though their Wives
they seem for to tender,
They would play the kind neighbors
and give the Bulls feather.
Why should we repine,
that our Wives are so kind,
Since we that are Husbands,
are of the same mind?
Shall we give them Feathers,
and think to go free,
Believe it believe it,
that hardly will be.
For he that disdains my
Bulls Feather to day,
May light of a Lass that,
will play him foul play:
There Is never a proud Gallant,
that treads on Cows leather,
But may be Cornuted, and
wear the Bulls Feather.
The shortest, the tallest,
the foulest, the fairest,
The fattest, the leanest,
the commonest the rarest:
When they and their Dicks,
are all merry together,
Will be using tricks,
to advance the Bulls feather.
A King and a Cobbler,
a Lord and a Loon,
A Prince and a Peddler,
a Courtier and a Clown:
Put all their Degrees, and
conditions together,
Are liable always to
wear the Bulls feather.
Though Beer of that Brewing,
I never did drink,
Yet be not displeased, if I
speak what I think:
Scarce ten in an hundred,
believe it, believe it,
But either they will have it,
or else they will give it.
Then let me advise
all those that do pine,
For fear that false Jealousy
shorten their Line:
That disease will torment them,
worse than any Fever,
Then let all be contented, and
wear the Bulls feather.
