The Young Women and Maidens LAMENTATION:
OR, Their bitter Sighs and Sorrow to hear the Old Women are pressed to go with
the Army, while they themselves are slighted and dejected which are able to
perform far better Service.

Tune of I marry and thank ye too.
Licensed according to Order.





WE Lasses of London Town
in sorrowful sort appear,
Because the Fates on us does frown;
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
To wait on the warlike Train,
and March in the Van and Rear;
But Maids they will not entertain,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
We would with our Maiden Skill,
like Amazon Dames appear;
But we are unregarded still,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
It Is Reason they should allow,
young Lasses to have a share;
But Kissing goes by Favor now,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
We like the sweet tender Dove,
could every Soldier Cheer;
Yet still they slight a Maiden's Love,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
With Age they do grunt and groan,
nay, tremble and quake for fear,
yet tell them this, it is all one,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
I am sure a young Lass can Nurse
a Soldier they need not fear;
But see the Case is altered thus,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
We'd cuddle them in our Arms,
and this will their Spirits cheer;
Yet notwithstanding all our Charms,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
Our Sweethearts are marched away,
the which we adore so dear,
And we behind are forced to stay,
Old Women are Pressed we hear.
We'd kiss and embrace them too,
and Love should like Fountains flow,
But old Wives they can nothing do,
Then why should not Virgins go?
Our Glory and Fame shall Ring,
and bafflle the proudest Foe,
In getting Soldiers for the King,
Then why should not Damsels go?
Young Heroes that will adorn,
the Army in time we know,
As being Soldiers bred and born,
And why should not Damsels go?
To venture who would refuse?
there is Glory and Fame you know,
And Teeming time we are loath to loose,
And why should not Damsels go?
The Captains for Females good,
may pity and kindness show;
Alas! we are all Flesh and Blood,
and have a great mind to go.
For why should we stay behind,
in sorrowful grief and woe?
I hope at length they will be so kind,
to suffer young Maids to go.
