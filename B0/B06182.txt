THE TRAPPAND VIRGIN
Or good Advice to Maidens, that they may not be drawn into Priminaryes by the
specious Pretenses of their seeming Amorist's, who having once obtained their
Wills, leave and forsake their betrayed Mistresses.

Take my Advice while you are free,
And Young Men do not trust,
They promise fare as fare can be,
But mean what is unjust.
Tune, When busy Fame.


COme mourn with me you Ladies all,
whom Young men have betrayed,
I was beloved of great and small,
and thought a virtuous Maid:
At length a Young Man to me came
and he did me much wrong,
For he betrayed a harmless Maid
with his deludeing Tongue.
Such vows and Protestations he
did to me often use,
With sighs, and Sobs that pittyed me,
so that I could not choose
But condescend to his desire,
by which I me ruined quite,
In a haples hour he crop't the Flower
wherein I took delight.
My Virgins Name I must disown.
which grieves me to the Heart,
And since my Maidenhead is flown
I feel such deadly smart,
That makes me often desire to dye
to be freed from that shame,
All will bestow on me I know
whoever hear the same.
But this may somewhat me excuse,
which brings me some content,
Obstinately I did Refuse,
and would not give consent,
Till he did vow and swear to me
he would make me his Wife,
But now I find, he has changed his mind,
I am weary of my life.
ANd he from me is fled and gone
a false and perjured wretch,
Whilst by my self I make my moan,
and many a sigh do fetch,
But it is in vain I plainly find
since nothing will avail,
Why should I sigh away my life
unless I could prevail.
Take warning by me Maidens fair
and do not be Trappand,
To their pretenses give no Ear,
for if they understand
You Are of a gentle Nature,
and begin to them to yield,
They Will flatter on till you are undone
and they have won the Field.
When they have got what they desire
their passion's at an End,
They Will cool that seeming fervent fire
and you shall lose your Friend,
But keep them at a distance, and
you will find them stoop amain,
So you may be from dangers free,
and need not to complain.
Such good Advice I once did want
which makes me now lament,
And when too late I think upon it
it breeds such discontent,
That I do wish ten thousand times
I had his Suit denied,
Who now I find does prove unkind,
and me has terrified.
False hearted men where e're you be
think not for to Escape,
For what you gain by Treachery
is next kinn to a Rape,
And will in time requited be
with some most just reward
Hereafter then prove honest Men,
and faithful to your word.
