A New SONG of Moggie's Jealousy: OR, Jockies Vindication
Moggy from Jockey she needs would depart,
Though Jockey he loved his Moggy at heart,
Jockey he wondered at Moggies strange huff,
But Moggy was jealous, and that was enough.
Tune of, You London Lads be merry; Or, Woo't thou be wilful still my Joe




THere was an a bonny young Lad;
was keeping of bonny win Sheep;
There was an a bonny young Lass,
was a wading the waters so deep:
Was a wading the waters so deep,
and a little above her knee;
And still she cried bonny Lad;
will thou come and Mow with me:
Where art thou ganging my moggy?
and where art thou ganging my Dove
And woo't thou go from thy poor jockey,
and so dearly that he does love?
Iseganging to fait Edenborough,
to spit for a Lad that is true;
And if I return not to morrow,
then Jockey Ise bid thee adien.
How think thou that I can endure,
to part with thee all along night?
When I am not able, thou art sure,
to have thee once out of my sight:
It Is a folly my Jockey to flatter,
for I must gang where I did tell,
Or offer to mince up the matter,
so Jockey Ise bid thee farewell.




BUt shall I gang with thee my fair one,
and shall I gang with thee my Joe?
And shall it be welcome my dear one,
togang with my moggy, or no?
We Will hand in hand trip to the house,
that stands within ken of the Town:
And there I will have a carrouse,
and for ever take leave of my loon.
But what have I done my moggy,
that thou art so willing to part
With poor unfortunate jockey,
and break his too loving heart.
He warrant his heart for a Plack,
ye'as mere a Mon then to rue,
For a thing that ye cannot lack,
and so Jockey Ise bid thee adieu.
Then must we part, my jewel,
and I never see thee no mere?
And can thou be so cruel,
to eyn that loves thee so dear?
d^n have I not loved thee as muckle,
and have I not shown it as true?
But I scorn to another to truckle,
so Jockey Ise bid thee adieu.
Now Heaven preserve my good woman,
Ods Bread she is jealous I trow;
My moggy these tyers are not common;
thy heart has had muckle to do:
It Is only a lovesick mistake;
that ever can make me untrue;
But the Parson amends he shall make,
if you never will bid me adieu.
How willingly I do believe thee,
and tie thee once more to my heart^
But if thou again does deceive me,
for ever, for ever we will part:
But Ise am in hopes that my Jockey,
will never more prove so untrue,
But ever be kind to his moggy,
nor Ise never bid him adieu.
FINIS.
