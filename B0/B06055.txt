The Scotch Lasses Choice, OR, Jennys Love for Jockey's Kindness: An Excellent
New Song, much in Request.
To a pleasant New Scotch Tune.
^ I.
LOng Cold Nights, when Winter-Frozen,
Jockyes head lay on my Bosom;
Now each wanton Lass pursues him,
Ah-wa's-me, that I must loose him:
Sawney and Jemmy came often to try me,
Philly and Willy would fain ligg by me;
But, alas! they do but Teaze me,
Jockey he alone can please me.
II.
When he Writes his Love in Meeter,
When he Sings to make it sweeter,
To the Clouds my Soul was driven,
Then I thought my self in Heaven;
Fether and Mether that knew little of it,
Wooed me, and su'd me, to Wed for profit;
But had Fate been bad or luckey,
Ise would never forsake poor Jockey.
III.
Wot ye weel why I adore him,
Would you know why Ise dye for him?
He was young, and blithe, and bonny,
And could love the best of any:
When Ise was lying in dying condition,
Jockey would still be my best Physician;
Though the Doctor never could please me,
He had still a Doze would ease me.
IV.
In his Arms he would infold me,
And he there so fast would hold me,
That Ise hardly could get from him,
May geud Fortune light upon him.
With Kisses and blisses my heart reviving,
Philly and Willy they fain would deprive him
Of my Love, to him so mickle,
But geud faith, Ise not so fickle.
V.
Sawney fine as any Leard too,
With a blew Bonnet and Sweard too;
Wooed me, and would fain have led me
To the Kirk, there for to Wed me:
Gin Fether and Mether they both consented,
But Ise feared Ise should after repent it;
To Marry would be Unlucky
Any but my neane sweet Jockey.
VI.
But ah-wa's-me, Ise am fearful,
And cannot be glad and Cheerful;
The Lasses make sike a doing,
And my Jockey from me Wooing;
They would if they could, by their kindness move him
Molly and Dolly too, vow they do love him;
If Jockey is from me flying,
Ah-wa's-me, then Jenny's dying.
VII.
But Jockey vowed by his Bonnet,
He Would Wed me what e're came on it;
Without the consent of either,
My Old Fether or my Mether:
For be they willing or no, Ise never tarry,
But as soon as I can, my Jockey Marry:
Then wee's both will ligg together,
And never matter the Cold Weather.
FINIS.
