The DEVIL upon DUN: OR The Downfall of the Upstart CHEMIST:
Being the Second Edition of a Late SONG:

To the Tune of Smoke us, and choke us.


Amongst all Professions in the Town,
Held most in renown,
From the Sword to the Gown,
The upstart Chemist rules the Roast;
For He with his Pill
Does even what he will,
Employing his skill,
Good Subjects to kill,
That he of his dangerous Art may boast,
O it is the Chemist, that man of the fire,
Who by his Black Art
Does Soul and Body part:
He smoaks us, and choaksus,
And leaves us like Dun in the mire.
And first for the Lawyers, who multiply,
That one can scarce lie,
And the other stand by,
Five Grains took of the grand Preparation,
Their Bodies will maull,
Thin Westminster Hall,
Cease Suits, and give a long Vacation.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
At the Sessions house he commenced his Trade,
Where he aloud prayed
For the King, long he stayed
Not there, being burnt in the hand
To inure him to fire,
He proceeded then high'r,
Restless in desire,
Till he of a Chemist had the Brand.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
As for the Parsons, both Pro and Con,
Dispute, and Objection,
Cannot save them, the Chemist anon
With the Elixir can soon end the strife,
Straight silence them both,
Who to agree are loath,
For the Ginny-pigs sake, though
Their quarrels give the Old Cause new life.
Also the Soldier, that man of Arms,
Who never fears harms,
Nor any fresh alarms,
Let this Chemist enter the Field
Even with a General,
The brav'st Colonel,
A Pill, or Sublimate will make them yield.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
Dull Aristotle was an old Fool,
For he went to School
Instead of the Stool:
What he wrote, he stole from Books;
This mystery is such,
Say who can too much
In it? whose deadly touch,
Makes Bum-foder scarce, it who twice brooks?
O it is the Chemist, that man of the fire,
Who by his Black Art
Does Soul and Body part:
He smoaks us, and choaks us,
And leaves us like Dun in the mire.
The learned Universities,
Ancient as Mince-pies,
Say that all are lies,
But Emperick-like he will make them broil
Like Sprats on the cole,
Leaving them no soul,
But make a deep hole
To bury their old heathenish soil.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
Old Physicians never writ
Ought of real wit,
But what was most fit
To be refined by the Chemical Art;
Rubarb, Senna, and Drugs
Even like to College Mugs,
Which the Sophister often lugs,
Nothing comes, but a Metaphysical F --
O it is the Chemist, etc.
Against Hippocrates and Galen eke,
These Saints have a peke,
'Cause they wrote in Greek;
With Learning they will not trouble the Brain,
The Mother Tongue alone
Kills dead as a stone;
This done with the fifteenth part of a Grain.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
The College Doctors with great heat,
Do very much brow-beat
So desperate a cheat,
Using proved methods safe to cure;
Yet these Chemists cry,
Who dares it deny?
At easy rates they will make all sure.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
If Wife of Husband, or Husband of Wife,
By reason of strife
Are we'ry, Or Fathers life
Hinders the Heir; his Laboratory
Can perform with have,
Without much distaste,
What Indian poison cannot supply.
O it is the Chemist, that man of the fire,
Who by his Black Art
Does Soul and Body part:
He smoaks us, and choaks us,
And leaves us like Dun in the mire.
The learned Chemists we don't decry,
Natures Mystery
He most faithfully
Unlocks: But our upstart Chemists be
A mere mushroom strain
Who give Folks their bain
Very Quacks in grain,
They, and the Sextons are in Fee.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
How say y' Sirs, shall these practice then,
Very expert men
TO kill, Dick, Tom, and Ben?
Nay, rather let this Chemical Crew,
Be sent to Algier,
That Trade may be free'r:
They Will outdoe a Navy, give the Devil his due:
O it is the Chemist, etc.
Then may New Troy with Citizens fill,
Being secured from ill;
Then no printed Bill,
No Almanac; no Tradesman's Shop
Shall the Elixir vent,
To make Experiment
On liege people, killing with one drop.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
Now to conclude, let us merrily sing
God bless Our Good KING
From the Dragons Sting,
Heavens preserve him Ages about:
For none of his Foes
The Commonweal oppose,
As every one knows,
By their great hurt, and woes,
Than the Quack and this Chemical Ront.
O it is the Chemist, etc.
