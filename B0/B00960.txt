A brief description of the Battles, Victories and Triumphs, atchiued by
the Duke of Parma and the Spanish army, sent by the King of Spain under his
conduct, to the succor of the rebellious Leaguers of France.
THe Duke of Parma by nation an Italian, and bound in affection to be a
Frenchman: yet through fear and ambition grown a Spaniard by faction, as also
through long practice by nature and complexion, that is to say: as being
replenished with vanity and presumption, having received a commandment from
his master the King of Spain, to pass in person with such forces as were in
the Low Cuntries, to the succors of the Leaguers the Kings rebels, did
consider that albeit his said master seemed to be provoked by the loss and
reproach of those who coming in March before, never returned again, yet the
drift was as much or rather more against himself, then against those that he
was sent against: and that his masters purpose was grounded rather upon the
remove of his footing out of the Low Cuntries, then upon any opinion that he
could atchiue any thing in France, wherein he was the rather confirmed in
respect of the express commandment that withal he received, to take with
him all such regiments of Wallons and Italians as were known to be any thing
trustye unto him, together with those Lords of the Country that he had any
amity or credit withal, to the end that all of them being thus abroad, and
him self entangled in some tediousness in France: it might be a fit
occasion and honest pretense with ease to bring in an other to command in his
stead, which is the matter whereat the King of Spain has most shot for these
five or six years, wherein he has found that the said Dukes proceedings in
those Cuntries showed plainlye that under the title of Governor he labored
for himself, as also that his ambition tended to lay hold upon that branch,
whenever this withered tree should fall: as having thereupon fixed a revenge
for the loss of his right in Portugal. Nevertheless having conceived all
this, he yet deemed that if he should excuse himself of this voiadge he should
have laid his merchandise too open, besides that peradventure it might have
been a sufficient argument to the King his master, to declare himself openly
against him, and by force to enterprise that which he sought to compass by
policy. Presuming therefore that he might better escape ye one way, then the
other: and withal knowing it as yet no time by force to deal against his
master, as not being sufficiently settled in the Cuntry: besides yt there
remained in the said Cuntries a number of Spaniards with whom he had no
intelligence: he determined for this once to yield, and to accept of the
commission to enter into France. Howbeit somewhat to frustrate his masters
drifts, and to the end to leave behind him no man to shut him from his
return: besides the aforesaid commission, he purposed to take with him also
two regiments of Spaniardes that were appointed to remain in the Country,
taking his excuse upon the great practices, purposes and devises that he had in
those parts, in respect whereof it was expedient at his first coming, to
work some great effect, which without the said Spaniards he was not able to
compass: heere-vpon before any countermaund could be returned, he forced them
to march, and according to the Spanish Proverb, consented to some loss, for
fear of losing more: and so chose rather to leave the Cuntry naked, and to
give the States opportunity to wrest from him some holds, then to remain in
danger to find the gate shut at his own return.

Having therefore resolved to come into France, he was not content in his own
fantasy to brag that he was craftier then his master, but thought also
particularlye to reap some profit of his voyage, and imagining him self to be
already Earl of Flaunders, he devised to renew the old pretenses of the Duke
of Burgandy unto such towns in Pickardy as stand upon the River of Some, and
on that side framed his first practices, as presuming to bring them to his own
devotion, yet imagining that if he could not so soon compass them, he would
at the least lay earnest upon them against he were stronger: this fruit did he
purpose to reap of his voyage. The King of Spain likewise had also an other
purpose whereby to find means to be rid of the said Duke of Parma, which was
once more to revive that languishing poison that has lingered within him these
two years, that it might take effect during his being in France, so to have
some upon whom to lay the blame, that he knows has long been laid upon
him self: but as the Italians are their craft masters in matter of poison, so
has the D. found means so to prevent this drift by good counterpoisons, that
it has wrought no greater effect then the other.

Hitherto had the D. of Parma been always an Italian, but afterward he played
the Spaniard in earnest. And first to begin, when he was most resolved upon
this iourneye, then seemed he coldest and most uncertain, to the end so to
terrify the D. of Main, and to drive him into such necessity as to do him
this homage: namely, to come even home to his gate to beg his help, whereto
indeed was he forced, yea even to come to Brussels, where he was received with
such grauitye or disdain, besides that he came but badlye furnished, that in
this Court he seemed not of so much account, as even any his messenger coming
from him ought to have done, as also at that instant all ye Spaniards began to
have him in such contempt, that from thencefoorth so long as they stayed in
those parts, they abated no whit thereof, yea it still rather increased then
otherwise, so that they returned him home again without any resolution upon
his propositions, and utterly ignorant in all matters except of spanish
reuerences and ceremonies which he was forced to learn while he stayed at the
Court.

Afterward the said D. of Parma suffered himself to be courted and solicited
with sundry embassages, still waiting that the necessity of the Parizians
increasing: the D. of Main with his partakers should call upon his presence
with greater submissions, and receive him with more favor: upon these
lamentable and pitiful supplications and protestations the D. of Main also
for his part meant to ad the same policy as he had before used, in hastening
the first succors that he received by sending ye Lord of Villeroy to the
King, to show some desire to talk of peace, as also he counseled the
Parizians to send forth the Cardinal of Gondy, and ye Archbishop of Lions, as
their deputies to his Majesty, with seeming to be desirous to yield, so to put
hammers in the Spaniards brains, and hasten their coming: which in truth was
the best means and greatest persuasion that he could have used. Thus when the
D. of Parma was resolved upon his going, and had already set forward his
forces, namely the Spaniards whom he would not leave behind: he began to
send forth throughout the world a thundering of his journey into France, with
the description of his army, wherein were named more Princes, Dukes,
Marquises, and Earls then are in all the States of Spain, and that his power
was some 18. or 20000. footmen, and 3000. horse, but such as he painted forth
for so many Alexanders or Caesar's, able to conquer a whole new world if any
were discovered: he gave his troops also proud titles, yea even the Terses of
his Spaniards, some he named Amutinados, others Mansferidos, and others such
lofty names, as might suffice to make the Mares cast their foles: neither did
he forget also to publish the state of his furniture, of his great stable, of
his Pages, sumpters, and the couers of his fourscore Moyles and Cofers, the
noise of whose bells he thought sufficient to make all the towns that held for
the King to yield: also his great quantity of great locked carriages full of
unknown engines, which at one only discharging should carry away a whole army.

Being entered into France, where he found no resistance (for the most of the
nobilitye were gathered to the king) he never enquired but how many days march
it was to Rochell, the taking whereof he purposed to assure himself off by the
way, fearing nothing so much as least the Viceroy of Pampelune should come and
meet the King in the plains of Bordeaux (whether he imagined he should flee
at the only sound of his coming) and there overthrow him before his
arrival, and so take from him the honor of this overthrow which he accounted
most certain: Neither had his forerunners failed to instruct the Preachers of
Paris, who already exalted him as the great Tamburlayn, yea the grauers were in
hand with pictures of brass and marble for him as for the deliverer of
France. Thus with all his Cocodrils tears and Spanish smokes, he marched on,
leaving in all places where he went, the tokens of the most barbarous and
notable cruelties that were ever practiced against the Moors, giving out that
if the king still remained before Paris, he would not lose one hour but
straight go and give him battle.

At his entrye into the Realm, the said Lord of Main sent to receive him the
Lord of S. Paul, sometime a Page, and afterward one of the household servants
of the Lord of Beauuaies Nangy, and now one of the most famous Lords of the
leaguers army. But when he came within three days iourneye of Meaux, the
said Lord of Main in person with the cheifest of his Captains was to see
him, but did but smally recover the honor of his journey to Brusselles, as
being so meanly furnished, that the Spaniards who thought them all Angels (so
greatly were they adorned with feathers) did so disdain them, that they never
suffered any but only the said Lord of Main to enter into the Chamber, yea
scarsely into the D. of Parmas lodging.

Being come to Meaux, which was about the end of August 1590. he showed
himself astonished to hear that the King was still before Paris. There began he
to take possession of absolute commandment over the army: And to show that he
esteemed neither the D. of Main nor any of his leaders for Captains, without
farther counsel or advice, he changed all their purpose, and where they were
resolved to march toward the heart of France, and to draw toward Paris, he
thought it better to take his way along by the River, and having viewed the
Card, he appointed his lodging at the town of Chelles, yet was he much amassed
when he knew that the King had prevented him in seazing upon the said lodging,
but afterward coming forth with the Duke of Main to view the plain, and
seeing the King coming with a good troop directlye toward them, they were
contented for that time to take no nearer sight, yea he was more amazed the
next day, when he knew that the Kings whole army was come within a small
League of him, even into the sight of each other: but when from the top of a
little hill he descried it in battle array, a chilling fear began also to
seize upon him: for perceiving in two or three squadrons 4000. french horse,
whereof there might be some 3000. gentlemen, and some 800. Reisters, also 10.
or 12000 French footmen, and some 4000. Switzers, and withal among them such a
countenance, that he might well think that they meant not to trouble him with
following them into the plains of Bordeaux, there to abide the battle: this
poor Prince was so daunted and in such a rage, that as it is said he swore and
blasphemed God in three or four languages, least he should not understand him:
and complained unto the said L. of Main that he had brought him to the
slaughter, neither do we read in the fables of any so sudden metamorphosis
as was there presently made, for from furious Lions as at ye first they were,
they were presently transfourmed into Foxes: who thought no longer of
assailing, but of defending themselves: and in liewe of appearing any further,
each of them fell to making his den in the earth, which by great good hap was
in a Marsh, well ditched of it self and of a strong seat.

Then had they the pleasure to behold this Army in battle array three days
on a row, which seemed as many cold weeks to temper their heat, that was all
wasted upon the taking of the little Town of Laigny, that stood at their
backs, wherein he that was the Governor, resolved a while to stay for them, in
full intent to abandon it at their coming, for indeed it was no way to be
holden, as appears by the sequel, but he see them come so disorderly, that at
length himself took courage and held out longer then reason required: Never
did mad dogs so tear in pieces any carrion, as did these Spaniards all that
they found in the said town, without exception of age or sex, either of
Churches, which they reserved for the scaffoldes and theaters of their most
horrible cruelties and infamous abominations: which notwithstanding, yet grew
they no whit the more courageous or desirous of the battle that they had so
often bruted, for their appetites and lusts thereto were glutted with seeing it
so often offered.

The King perceiving that there was no means to force them to the fight, much
less to get them to it voluntarily or of their own accord, showed them an
other point of brauerye, and yet with a militarye discretion, which was soon
confirmed by the effect thereof: namely, by seperating his army six or seven
Leagues from him, retaining about his own person skarde the third part, which
notwithstanding they never drew toward him, neither durst they enterprise any
thing until they perceived him to be further off: but his Majesty loath to
loose time, went to besiedge ye Town of Clermount in Beauais, where he stayed
above 10. days, during the which out of this great army they might have
dismissed some troops through favor of ye towns Pontoise and Beauais, which
they held near unto Cleremount, either to have raised the siege, or at the
least to have molested his said Majesty's army, which as then was weak in
horse, yet suffered they the Town to be taken partly by assault, and partlye by
composition, without any their defense or alarm.

Howbeit while they perceived his Majesty thus occupied, after many their
secret and great deliberations, and sundry their preparatiues, as if it had
been to assault three or four towns at once, according as they gave out:
they resolved to beseidge the Town of Corbeil (the same is a small Town
having a bridge over the river of Seyne, of no strong situation, neither easy
to be fortified by man's industrye, as by the sequel may be well proved) which
they that were in it, with commission rather to linger the enemy, then
obstinatly to withstand him, took assurance to defend by reason of their manner
of proceeding, so that at the fortnights end having been beaten with a number
of artillerye, brought from Paris, also having holden out and repulsed one
assault, they quailed the enemies for returning any more in fifteen days
after. In the mean space the Duke of Parma erected an arsenoll, wherein he
kept a number of woorekmen, that labored night and day, not suffering any of
them to come forth or to speak with any body, yea he kept so sure watch that
none, no not the Duke of Main might know what was in doing, insomuch that men
thought it to be some device to transporte Corbeile even whole, and to send it
unto the coast of Spain, but in the end it was found to be certain boats
covered with earth and turffe, wherein to transporte Soldiers to a breach made
on the other side of the river. Finally after a months delay, the defendants
having been too obstinate, and beaten with 22. pieces of Ordinance from break
of day almost unto midnight: being in manner all maimed with the cannon, the
town was taken by a general assault, whereof the French made the first point,
yet when the Spaniards entered, they used the^ as enemies, and slew more of them
that had opened them the gates, then of those that had kept them so long shut:
there practiced they whatsoever new inue^tions and most horrible cruelties that
their industry was able to afford.

The Duke of Parma could not meet with ingeniours or architects enowe to
describe the plant of this seidge and Town of Corbeile, not in such state as
it the^ was, but in such sort as he devised, as also he purposed to make and
build a fortres in it, whereby to make it impregnable, to which end he sent
into all parts of Europe, having so far forth bound this poor small Town,
(which among us was of no fame, but only in respect of the number of Peach
trees that grow among the Vynes thereabout) that now it shall be accounted one
of the strongest holds of all France, howbeit only with such as shall never
hear what has since ensued.

After this seidge, Parts which by this small beginning gathered assurance of
much better, for the full furnishing of their bonfiers, did almost make an end
of burning that small store of wood that yet remained, whereof now they have
greater want then ever. The Duke of Parma was invited thither to sport him,
the banquets were provided, his lodging was furnished with the best of the
Kings moueables, the Princesses and Ladies had decked and made themselves
ready, yea there were that even purposed to snare him in their loves, whereby
afterward to marry with him: But his loves and affections resting in a fatter
and more fruitful soil, he was no whit moved with all these baits. And
contrariwise being jealous of his prize, he stayed there yet three weeks to
provide for the preservation thereof, keeping his counsails secret, whereto even
the Duke of Main had but sildome access, only giving out that he purposed at
one instant to set upon Melune, Province Montereau, and three or four other
Towns standing upon the River of Seyne, so to set free the upper side of the
River, as meaning also to do the like with Poissy. Meulan, Mante, Vernon, and
Pont del' Arch that stand beneath the said river, but all this grew to
nothing: for contrariwise finding no great safety for him self so near to
Melune, whose garrison did daily molest him, he determined to retire from
Corbeile: which he had no sooner done, but he heard that the said garrison of
Melune had recovered it again, and cut in pieces 7. or 800. men that he had
left there in garrison, which news was also seconded with ye reprise of Lagny:
heervpon the L. of Main with the Parizians came and coniured him to return to
the recovery of Corbeile, from whence he was not past six or seven Leagues
off: but his first price forced him to resolve not to undertake it again the
second time, as being well advertised, that he that was now in it was thoroughly
resolved to his defense: albeit he then protested to return. Nevertheless
seeing that the L. of Main had again sent the Lord of Villeroy to the King to
seek to renew some treaty of peace (yet was not his embassage without his
knowledge and consent) he meant to turn the same to his own use, and thereupon
made no haste to return as he might have done, but lingered them, in hope that
at his return he would yet enterprise somewhat, sometime propounding unto the^
Chasteau Therry, sometime Compiegne, which was only to color his abode in
those parts, that te^ded but to wait whether ye most mutenous and zealous
Leaguers would not find themselves grieved at this parley of peace, and so have
recourse to him to make him their General, and to abandon the D. of Mayn, as
also for his part he failed not to procure the^ to be under hand thereto
solicited, as giving the^ to understand that he misliked of this treatye of
peace, and denying the grant of his consent thereto, in hope thereby to trippe
the D. of Main, for he had by experience found that the conduct of an army or
any great enterprise could not bear two equal powers, because that growing
upon diversity of accidents, they would also breed diversity of opinions,
whereby each part being of force sufficient to maintain his opinion, it was
necessary for either of them to stand in fear of his companion, and so
consequently he sought to assure him self, which could not be without the
overthrow of the one or the other. Heereto he imagined that he might attain
by the overthrow of the Duke of Main: but the Spaniards had in France borne
themselves so insolentlye and that indifferently, against as well those that
called them as those whom they pretended to subdue: that the people abhorred
them more then death it self.

Thus seeing him self then frustrate of the drifte whereby he pretended to
recover the reputation that he had lost in this voyage, he judged that
hereafter every thing would grow worse for him, and therefore in earnest
resolved to depart: but therein also he found one let that hindered his
imagined diligence. For the King seeing that come to pass, which at the
beginning (yet with discretion and judgment) he had foretold of the D. of
Parmas coming: namely, that he should be driven to retire before the year
were at an end, thought it also necessary not only for his own reputation, but
also for the restrayning of him from all surprises in his return, to hold him
as short as he might: and therefore determined even in discretion to be present
himself: and as he is always resolute in his opinions, so has he two
incomparable qualities, namely speed and courage in his executions, which
commonly are most favored by fortune, and do always bring forth the gretest
and most wonderful effects.

Upon this resolution, without any noise he departed the fourth day of November
from Escouis in Normandy, with one troup of horse and an other of harquebuziers
on horseback without any cariages, leaving his main battle with the Lord
Marshall Biron, to employ according as they had concluded, and so came with all
speed to Compiegne, where immediately upon his arrival he invited all the
nobility of Picardy which is great, to come to assist him to ye honor of his
house, to reconduct the Duke of Parma out of France, who had deserved that
favor at his hands, if not for any service done, yet for the small hurt that
he had sustained by him, whereupon within a few days he had nigh a thousand
good horse, with whom he began to seek after the Duke of Parma, who craved none
of these courtesies, but could have been content to have stopped the belles of
his Moyles so to pass with less noise, for being loath to adventure to pass
the Cuntry of Picardy with his own troops alone in the Kings face, who had no
footmen, neither half so many horsemen as he, he urged the Duke of Main to
assemble all his horse to accompany him, as not caring greatly what might
become of Main, so himself were in safety, and so stayed for his succor.

His majesty also for his part sent for the Duke of Neuers to bring him as
many horse as he might, to the end to furnish himself the more honorably:
but before they could join, knowing that the Duke of Parma marched, he was
straight at his heels, and at his first coming sending his men to the war,
the 22. of the said month, he defeated a whole company of Spaniards without
the loss of any of his, or saving any of the others. The five and twentieth,
himself purposed to view them, and having sent before the Lord Baron of Biron,
Marshall of the Camp of his army, with some troop of horse, himself followed
at hand with an other: raising such an alarm in the enemies Camp, that he
drew them all against him self, and in their faces charging them a dozen
times, he retired with less then two hundredth horse without any loss, having
so amazed them, that they encamped all night at their first lodging: At his
departure thence, his Majesty found himself within one leage of the Duke of
Mains lodging, whereupon suddenly without drawing bit, he purposed to find him
at his bed, but that good Prince being thereof advertised, presently gets on
his boots again, takes horse and at randon casts himself into the Duke of
Parmas arms, leaving that quarter full of cariages and sick persons.

Within few days after the said D. of Neuers joined with the king with a good
troop, as did also the L. of Gyury master of the Camp of his light horsemen,
and the Lord of Parabelle, who returned from Melune, where because he could not
see his highness, he would not let him depart without kissing his hands.
This renforte being come to his majesty, al his men became better courtiers
then before, for daily they were with the Dukes highness at his vprising and
downelying, and still with new booties, albeit he marched so close, that he
took not the twentieth part of his ordinarye lodging, leaving without pity or
mercy, a tail of his people that could not make so good speed, of whom the
peasants also had as little. Thus in this fear, with this shame, a bitter
repentance for his entrye into France, and good protestatio^s never to return
again, the D. of Parma with as much of his army as could save it self, was
driven away, leaving the good D. of Main to attend in his return, whatsoever
it may please God.

In the mean time the King went to S. Quintins to refresh him self, where he
was magnificallye received: and soon after the Town of Corbie was restored
into his Majesty's obedience, through the good conduct of the Lord of Humiers,
and other noble men that framed that enterprise: a town of very great
importance, in respect of the situation, as standing in the midst between
Amiens, Perone and Dourlens, to whom together with other the towns of
Pickardy, this will be a scourge, as in short time will appear.

This is the true discriptions of the battles, victories and triumphs of the
D. of Parma throughout his whole voyage, these be the crowns and pillars whose
inscriptions were ready provided: he came to plant a Colony of Spaniards in
France, but he did but sow it abroad in the fields, which have line covered
with their dead, out of whose ashes they shall not spring again as does the
Phoenix, for out of such carrions can proceed nothing but serpents and other
such venomous beasts: and the battle which this poor Prince through a
principal point of industrye imagined to have escaped in great, he lost by
retaile: for it is most certain, that of all the great numbers of horsemen and
footmen that he brought in, he carried away not past 7. or eight thousand, and
those in such state, as if they had come forth of some spittle house: he came
to restore Paris into liberty, to take again all the Towns that hold for the
King in the Provinces thereabout, and to send him beyond the River of Loyre:
but he has left Paris in greater want then before, as having all the rivers
straighter closed up both above and beneath the^ ever they were: so far also
has he been from recovering any one town, that the King has won one even
before his face: besides that after ye King had him in chase, the L. marshall
Biron has recovered what by force and what by composition, four Towns, and
above twenty fortresses and castles wherein the enemy kept garrison: having as
his majesty's cause is most just, prosecuted the war against them,
especially by the executioners of high justice: he came also to purchase
authority in France, and to strengthen himself with practices and freendship,
but has lost all his credit in this part: for they have accused him to have
betrayed his master, and the Spanish name is grown so odious among them, that
they are ready to enter leage to go and leauy war in Spain, in revenge of
ye outrages and insolencyes that they have received. This poor Prince who
finds himself sicklye and of no long life, came with intent here to shut up
the step of all his labors, by some notable act which might have made his
memory famous, and vphelde that vain reputation which with small labor and
less merit he had already purchased: but contrariwise he has here encurred
a reproach and shame which will give such a blemish to his reputation as will
never be wiped out again. But if in this voyage he has done his masters
business but badlye, as having spent him a million of gold, and lost him a
great number of his best men, and returning laden with nothing but grief and
shame, even at their hands in whose help he came: he has yet made a wurse
market in the Low Cuntries that are under his charge, where the Earl of
Nassawe and the States during his being in France, have taken the towns of
Steenbergue in Brabant, and Oudemborg in Flaunders, with twenty other holds,
and 30. or 40. pieces of Ordinance in the same.

Moreover besides all these mischiefs already come to pass, there is yet one
more of far greater consequence ready to happen, yea even inevitable: for
the said D. of Parma has through the said journey ouerslipped the occasion
either to satisfy the Princes of the Empire in their suit to the King of
Spain for the restitution of those places that he holds and usurps in the
Duchess of Cleue and Iulick, and other ye members of the Empire: either else, if
he mean not to do it, which is very likely, to provide himself to defend and
keep them perforce, which now he can hardly do in time convenient, in that ye
said Princes of the Empire standing discontent for that they were not satisfied
in their said demands, are fully resolved without further treatye or parley to
bring down the mightiest and strongest army that has been leauyed in Germany
in a long time, against the which neither the D. nor his master have any thing
to oppose, so that of necessity they will recover those places, which hitherto
have been the Mother nources of Flaunders: besides that this journey being
enterprised upon choler and disdain, it is to be presumed that such an army
being once in the field, will not so cease, neither shall want any pretenses to
proceed further. These be the fruits of this his voyage, or rather we may
say, the effects of Gods justice, who knows how to revenge such extreme
presumption and ambition, when men do least look for it.

This could not the king of Spain well comprehend in the overthrow of his great
army which he had provided for ye wrongful invasion of England but must needs
heap on this new testimony, which besides the losses above mentioned do also
draw on the overthrow of the reputation of his only man, that was able to bear
the name of a Captain, which hereafter he shall find to be of as great
importance unto him, as any thing yt ever he did. These be evident tokens that
Gods divine goodness is purposed to fulfill his prophecies against this usurper
and wrongful enterpriser as he did against Herod and Pharo, also that upon his
fall and overthrow he will build up the glory of those whom this man purposed to
destroy. This therefore is all that can be gathered out of the truth of the
Duke of Parmas whole journey after his entrye into France, until the last day
of the month of November, wherein he departed with shame which is not here set
down to any other end, but to serve as a remembrance to any such his
favorers as list to undertake the writing of this History.

FINIS.
