A PROCLAMATION
Anent the Rebels who have not yet taken the Bond.
CHARLES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith,
To (...) Macers, or Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in that part, conjunctly
and severally, specially constitute, Greeting;
The Rebellious and Insolent rising at Bothwel-Bridge was so far from hindering
Us from continuing Our Clemency and Indulgence, to such as had so ill Deserved
of Us formerly, then when it was in Our Power to have Extirpated that Insolent
and Vicious Crew; Yet to Convince the World and them, that Our former Favors
bad not proceeded from Force, but from Clemency, and being desirous that this
Our Clemency should have at last Convinced them, whom We were unwilling to
Destroy, Because they were Our Ancient and Native Subjects, who if they were
not strangely misled, should rather venture their Lives and Fortunes for Us,
then for these Vain and Giddy-preachers, whom all the rest of the
PROTESTANT-Churches disowne, and whose only Quarrel is, That We will not a^low
them to be themselves Chief Rulers: We did by a most Remarkable and unexpected
Proclamation, not only enlarge Our Indulgences to those who had not been
Engaged in that Execrable Rebellion, but even to those engaged therein;
Requiring only of such as were not Heritors, or Ministers, that they should
Obliege themselves not to rise in Arms against Us or Our Authority:
Notwithstanding whereof, a great part of the said Rebels have not as yet taken
the said Bond, though conceived in so gentle and easy Terms, and in which We
Designed as much the Security of their Native Country, as of Our own
Authority. But because many of these who have not taken the Bond, Do profess
that their not taking of it was occasioned by want of Lawful Intimation, Or by
their Sickness, and that they have other Legal Defencesor reasonable Excuses;
And We being equally unwilling to preclude Our People from any Legal Defense,
and from offering their reasonable Excuses and Verifications thereof; Or on the
other part, to have Our Authority baffled by such as have even Contemned Our
Clemency: Therefore to prevent both these, We hereby Command all Our Officers,
both in Burgh and Land, and the Officers of Our Militia, and Standing Forces to
Seiz and Apprehend; And Our respective Judges Competent to proceed according to
Law against such as were in the Rebellion, and who have not yet given in the
said Bond before the Dyets mentioned in Our last Proclamation, dated the twenty
seventh day of July last, Or who shall not give in to Our Justices betwixt and
the first day of January next, in the year 1680, the said Bond with the
Verisications of their reasonable Excuses, and thereby satissie the Lords of
Justiciary, that their not taking of it at the former Diet proceeded not from
their Contempt; Indemnifying hereby fully such as not being Ministers or
Heritors, and others not excepted in Our former Proclamations, as shall
satisfy the Commissioners of Our Justiciary, and shall be allowed by them to
take the said Bond in manner foresaid; And for ever excluding all such from Our
Mercy and Favor as have been in the said Rebellion, and have not either taken
the said Bond before the Dyets contained in Our last Proclamation, or shall not
take the same betwixt and the time foresaid; And we are confident all Honest
men and Good Christians will Concur against those obstinate Rebels, as Enemies
not only to Us, but to all Humane Society, And who now want the least shadow
of Pretext for Disobedience, or Irregularity? Certifying likewise, hereby all
Heritors who shall keep any of the said Rebels upon their Ground, or all
others who shall Harbor or Reset them, that they shall be proceeded against
with all the Severity that Law can allow, as Enemies to Us, and their Native
Country. Our Will is herefore, and We Charge you strictly, and Command, that
incontinent these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh,
and other places needful, and there in Our Name and Authority, by open
Proclamation, make Publication of the Premises, that none pretend Igno^ance,
and Ordains these presents to be Printed.

Given under Our Signet at Edinburgh, the thretteenth day of November, 1679.
And of Our Reign the thretty one year. AL. GIBSON, Cl. Sti. Concisilii.
