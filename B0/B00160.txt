A new Ballad, entitled, A warning to Youth, showing the lewd life of a
Merchants Son of London, and the misery that at the last he sustained by his
riotousnesse.
To the tune of the Lord Darley.
IN London dwelt a Merchant man,
that left unto his Son,
A thousand pound in Land a year,
to spend when he was gone:
With coffer crambd with golden crowns
most like a Father kind.
To have him follow his own steps,
and bear the selfsame mind.
Thus every man does know, does know,
and his beginning see,
But none so wise can show, can show,
what will his ending be.
No sooner was his father dead,
and clozed in his grave.
But this his wild and wanton son,
his mind to lewdness gave.
And being but of tender years.
found out such company,
Which proved his fatal overthrow,
and final misery.
In gluttonny and drunkenness,
he daily took delght,
And still in Strmpets company,
he spent the silent night:
Forgetting quite that drunkenesse.
and filthy lechery,
Of all the sins will soonest bring
a man to misery.
Within the Seas of wanton love,
his heart was drownde so deep.
A night he could not quietly
without strange women sleep.
And therefore kept them secretly,
to feed his foul desire,
Apparelled all like gallant youths
in Pages trim attire.
Their garments were of Crimson silk,
bedect with lace of gold,
Their curled hair was white as milk,
most comely to be hold.
He gave them for their Cognizance,
a Purple bleeding heart,
In which two silver arrows seemed,
the same in twain to part.
Thus secret were his wanton sports,
thus private was his pleasure,
Thus Harlots in the shape of men,
did wast away his treasure.
Oh woe to lust and lechery,
oh woe to such a vice
That buys repentance all too late,
and at too dear a price,
Yet he repented not at all,
so wilful was his mind,
He could not see his infamy,
for sin had made him blind.
But in his heart defir'd a change
of wanton pleasures so,
That day by day he wishes still,
strange women for to know.
And so discharging of his train,
and selling of his land.
To travel into countries strange,
he quickly took in hand,
And into Antwerpe speedily,
thus all aflaunt he goes,
To see the dainty Flemish Girls,
and gallant Dutchland Froes.
For still, quoth he the Dutchland Froes,
are kind to Englishmen.
I Will have my pleasure of those Girls,
or never come again:
And being arrived in Antwerpe streets,
he met a lovely Dame,
That was a Widows daughter dear,
of good report and fame.
Her beauty like the Purple rose,
so glistered in his eye,
That ravished with the same, he craved
her secret company.
But she like to an honest Maid.
by no means would consent,
To satisfy his lustful eye,
as was his fall intent,
A hundred days he wholly spent.
as many nights in vain,
As many angels he consumed,
Her maidenhead to gain.
But nothing he preuaild at all,
until that Satan's aid,
And cursed counsel helping him,
for to deflowre this maid.
For like a lustful Lecher he,
found such convenient time,
That he enforced her to drink,
till she was drunk with wine,
And being ouerchargd with wine,
as Maidens heads be meake:
He ravished her there, when that she
could no resistance make.
For being senseless there she lost
her sweet virginity,
Which she had kept full twenty years,
with great severity,
Therefore good Virgins take good heed
lest you be thus beguild.
When Wine is settled in your brain,
you may be got with Child.
And mark, I pray what then befell,
unto this modest Dame:
When she recovered her lost sense
and knew of her defame,
In pining grief, she languisht long.
like Philomel by night
And would not come for very shame,
in honest Maidens sight:
Her womb at last began to swell,
her Babe received life:
And being neither Widow nor Maid,
nor yet a married Wife,
Did wish that she had nere been borne.
but in her Cradle died.
Then Angels at the gate of Heaven,
had crowned her Virgin bright.
This Babe that breeds in my womb,
(quoth she) shall nere be borne,
Nor called a bastard by such wives,
that hold such love in scorn:
For I a Strumpet in disgrace,
though one against my will,
Before I will so shame my friends,
my dear lives blood I Will spill.
For as with wine I was deceived
and made a vicious Dame,
So will I wash away with Wine
my scar et spots of shame.
Then drinking up her burning Wine,
she yielded up her breath,
By which likewise the unborne Babe,
was scalded unto death.
Her Mother falling on her knees
to heaven did cry and call,
If ever Widows curse quoth she,
on mortal man did fall,
Then say, Amen to mine O Lord
that he may never thrive.
That was the cause of this mischance,
but rot away alive.
His nails from off his fingers dropped,
his eyes from out his head.
His toes they roted from his feet,
before that he was dead,
His tongue that had false-sworne so often,
to compass his desire
Within his mouth does glow and burn,
like coals of sparkling fire:
And thus in torment in his sin,
this wicked Caitife did,
Whose hateful Carkes after death.
in earth could not abide,
But in the mawes of Carrion Crows,
and Ravens made a Tomb,
A vengeance just on those that use
on such vile sins presume:
For Widows curses have full often:
been felt by mortal wights,
And for oppressed Widows wrongs,
still heavenly Angels fights:
For when King Henry the 6 by force
was murdered in the Tower,
And his fair Queen Widow mad,
by Crooke-backt Richards power:
She so exclaimed to the heavens,
for to revenge that deed,
That they might die in such like sort,
which caused him to bleed
Her curses so preuaild God wot,
that every one was slain,
Or murdered by ^ie cruel hands,
not one there did remain.
Both Crookebackt Richard, and his mates
Lord Loue^ and Buckingam,
With many more did feel her curse
which needless are to name
For widows wrongs still pierce the gate
of Gods celestial Throne,
And heaven it self will still revenge
oppressed widows moan,
Take heed take heed, you wanton youths,
take heed by this mishap:
Lest for your lust and lechery,
you be caught in a trap.
Leave off your foul abuses
you show to maid and Wives.
And by this wanton Merchants fall,
learn how to mend your lives.
FINIS.
