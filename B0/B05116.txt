A RELATION OF A Great Victory Obtained by Their Majesty's Forces in Ireland,
over the Irish Rebels.
In a Letter from Leverpool to a Friend in London.
Leverpool, March the 3d, 1690. SIR.
BY a Ship arrived this day from Dublin, from very good Hands, we have this
following Account, viz. That our Army then having Intelligence that 20000 of
the Irish Army were come over the Shannon, with a design to surprise and cut
off 10000 of our Men that were posted at Mullingar. It was ordered that
Douglass and Wolsely should, with a Party, march round, and get betwixt the
Enemy and the Shannon; and General Ginkle and Maj. Genesis Kirk should march from
Dublin with some detachments of Men, to reinforce the Party at Mullingar, and
fall upon the Enemy.

Which Project took such effect, that on Friday the 27 of February, both Armies
met together at a place called Ballimore, the Irish being about 20000. and ours
about 12000; Where they had a very hot Engagement for five Hours. The Irish
behaved themselves brave enough, for after they were broken, they rallied again
very vigorously three times; but were forced to retire to Athlone, unto which
place they were pursued to the very Walls. Our Men that were appointed to
interpose between them and the Shannon, came but just to fall into their Rear,
as they were retiring. In this Action we killed and took Prisoners between Five
and Six Thousand Men, with the loss of about Two hundred of Ours. It is said,
Sarsfield is mortally wounded: But it is certain that General Ginkle was brought
to Dublin on Sunday-night in a Coach, sorely wounded. We have taken most of
their Bagage, and also their Horses, which are very poor and lame. Accept of
this brief Account, from

Your Humble servant, etc.
