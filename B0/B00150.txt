LONDON, Printed for WILLIAM WELBY. 1617.

TO THE CHRIstian Reader.
WE offer here unto thy view (good Christian Reader) the principles of
Religion, with a short exposition upon the same; for the explanation of what
may seem difficult, the confirmation of the truth professed against popery,
and the enforcing of sundry duties of weighty and great importance. The method
we have followed is plain and natural, the matter wholesome, but not adorned
with flowers of eloquence. We begin with the maine end, that al men ought to
aim at: because there can be no motion but for some end, as there can be no
effect but from some efficient. Thence we proceed to the means whereby the
end may be attained: for it is in vain to propou^d an end unto our selves,
if either the way be impossible, or imperfect; if either it cannot be known,
or do not lead to the fruition thereof. In the means we consider, whence
direction is to be taken, and what is to be learned: and there we show what,
and who God is, how we must conceive of him, why he ought to be worshipped,
what covenant he made with Adam in the time of innocence, and how Adam by
transgression fell, and plunged himself, and his posterity into woe and
misery unspeakable, intolerable, and eternal. In the next place we lay down
the means that God has ordained for man's recovery: And there is handled,
what Christ is, what he has done for us, how we are made partakers of his
benefits, how faith is wrought, and increased in us, and what obedience we owe
to God in Christ, who is the object of Christian religion. And because the
godly in this course of Christianity are compassed about with infirmities,
subject to many falls, and assaulted with many tentations, which might
discourage and turn them out of the way: Therefore we have added, what course a
Christian should take to grow in grace, how he may be preserved from falling,
how he should recover after his fall, and of what privileges the godly are, or
may be partakers in this life. And in the last place, the blessedness of the
Saints after this life is ended, is touched in few words; whereby the
sufficiency of the means is manifested. For as it is a way prescribed of God;
so it leads us unto God, the first, chief, and all-sufficient Good. Our
desire herein is to teach the simple Christian, how he may grow from grace to
grace, and from faith to faith: and to further such godly householders, as
desire to instruct and train up their children and servants in the information
and fear of the Lord; but want leisure or ability to furnish themselves, out
of larger and more learned Treatises. For their sakes we have adventured to
compile this poor treatise, and to make it common; that they might have some
help at hand, whereby they might be confirmed in the truth against the vain
cauils of the Papists, and the better enabled to inform them that be committed
to their charge. If any such shall vouchsafe to make use of this book, we
would desire him to mark and observe these few things. First that the letters,
a, and b, and c, etc. set over the Answer, do direct, what part of the
answer the Testimonies of Scripture alleged do serve to confirm. And the
figures 1. 2. 3. etc. do intimate what words, or which parts of the answer,
are explaned in the exposition. Secondly, in teaching the Questions and
Answers, take the pains to search into the proofs which are alleged for
confirmation of the matter; and if the same thing word for word be not found
in the verses of Scripture cited, then be pleased further to enquire what
reasons or arguments may be drawn from the place, to prove what is intended.
This we commend, because it is a course behouefull for the obtaining of well
grounded knowledge, the getting of steadfast and assured faith and comfort, and
growing to be familiarly acquainted with the word. Thirdly, in reading the
exposition of every answer, take notice what is delivered by way of
explication or confirmation, and what reasons, and how many are brought to
prove any point. Thereby a man shall be enabled to refer that which he
hears in the public assembly, or reads in other learned books, to some
head, apply it to right purpose, treasure it up safely in memory, for use in
the time of need, and have in readiness to answer the gainsaiers. Lastly,
because in such a multitude of quotations it cannot be, but some will be
mistaken; if in the places quoted thou find not that which makes to the
purpose, look into the Errata, and see whether it be not there amended, and
before thou begin to read, take notice of, and amend especially these more
gross ouersights in the printing. Page 102, line 21, for resisting; read
resting. Page 109, line 24, for void; read, good. Page 147, line 3, for, is
sealed; read, is not sealed. Page 174, line 11, insert, We may not vow. Page
177, lin. 5, for, can more; read, can no more.

Thus heartily desiring and hoping (good Reader) that thou will make use of
these directions given, profitably to guide thee through this small work; we
commit thee to God, and the word of his grace, who is able to direct, and
safely lead thee unto eternal happiness; craving that, if thou receive
benefit from God upon the perusal of this simple treatise, thou be careful to
pour out thy soul unto God for us, that he would enrich us with his grace
more and more, for the glory of God, the good of his Church, and the comfort of
our own souls.

The Printer to the Reader.
GEntle Reader, bear with some false pointings, though they be many,
occasioned by the multitude of quotations, and some ouer-sight: And vouchsafe
to correct with thy pen, these Errata following, hoping that the next
impression they will be amended in the body of the Treatise.

And are to be sold by WILLIAM WELBIE, in Paul's churchyard at the sign of the
Swan.

A Short Catechism, with an Exposition upon the same.
Q. WHAT ought to be the chief, and continual care of every man in this
life?
A. To 1. Cor. 10. 31.
glorify 1 God, and Act. 16. 30, 31. Matthew. 16. 26.
save his 2 soul.

Expos. 1. Gods glory, that is, his surpassing worthiness, cannot be increased,
nor fully manifested. Ex. 33. 20. because he is most perfect. Psalm. 16. 2. and
infinite. Job 22. 2. and 35. 7. God is said to glorify himself when he makes
his excellency to appear. Numb. 14. 21. Psalm. 72. 19. Ezeck. 43. 2. Angels
and men glorify him when they extol his greatness, and testify their
acknowledgement of his glory. Luc. 2. 14. Reu. 14. 7. Ex. 15. 2. Here then to
glorify God, is inwardly in heart. Romans 4. 20. 1. Cor. 6. 20. and outwardly in
word and action. Matthew. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 12. to acknowledge God to be such a
one as he has revealed himself. Reu. 4. 9. 11. Psalm. 29. 1. 2. and. 50. 23.
Of glorifying God, man should be most careful: for God is the beginning from
which, and the end unto which all things do tend. Romans 11. 36. his glory is in
it self most excellent. Exodus 33. 18. 19. Psalm. 148. 13. most dear to him.
Ex* 7. 4. 5. Esa. 42. 8. and 48. 11. the supreme end of all divine
revelation. Ephesians. 2. 7. of all his works. Ephesians. 1. 5. 6. Pro. 16. 4. Exodus 9. 16.
Psalm. 50. 15. Ioh. 11. 4. 40. of man's life. Psa. 6. 4. 5. and service. Zach. 7.
5. 6. Psa. 101. 1. Ioh. 3. 28. 29: and all means furthering the same, are
available to man's salvation. Romans 4. 20. 21. Ier. 13. 16. Matthew. 2. 2. 1. Sam.
2. 30. Psalm. 50. 23.

2. To take care for our salvation, is so to live here, that we may live with
the Lord hereafter. Phi. 2. 12. 2. Pet. 3. 11. 14. The salvation of the soul
is most precious. Psalm. 49. 8. cannot be obtained without care. Act. 2. 37. 1.
Cor. 9. 24. Matthew. 7. 13. Luke 12 24. and he is ever mindlesse of Gods glory,
that is careless of his eternal happiness. Ephesians. 2. 12. Ioh. 5. 44. and, 7. 18.
Also eternal life is a durable treasure. Luke 12. 33. and 16. 9. 10. 1. Tim.
6. 17. 18. al worldly things are vain, uncertain, and transitory. Matthew. 6.
19. Psa. 73. 18. 19. the soul came from God and is after a restles manner
carried to seek, and desire communion with God, and a desire to be happy, is
naturally planted in the hearts of all men, by God himself; therefore we
should earnestly set our affections upon things that are above. Col. 3. 1, 2.
Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14. and infinitely desire the enjoying of Gods presence in
heaven, for he is infinite in goodness, the highest of all things that are to be
desired.

Q. Whence must we take direction to attain hereunto?
A. Out of the Ioh. 20. 31.
word ^ of God alone.

Expos. 3. God only can give the crown of glory. 2. Tim. 4. 8. Iam. 1. 12. he
also is the author, object, and end of true religion. Genesis 18. 19. Act. 18.
25. 26. Ioh. 6. 29. therefore none but he can reveal the way how we should
obtain that everlasting inheritance. Psalm. 16. 11. Pro. 2. 6. 9. For the
nature of God is incomprehensible, his will and works are unsearchable. Heb.
11. 6. Deuteronomy. 4. 4. 6. and 29. 29. Heb. 11. 3. No man has known the Father but
the Son, and he to whom the Son has revealed him. Ioh. 1. 18. Matthew. 11. 27.
and the Gospel is an hidden mystery. 1. Cor. 2. 7. 10. Romans 16. 25. 26. so
that we can know nothing of God, until God himself manifests it unto us.
Psalm. 103. 7. and 147. 19. 20. By the word of God, we understand the will of
God revealed to reasonable creatures, teaching them what to do, believe, and
leave undone. Deuteronomy. 29. 29.

Q. What call you the word of God?
A. The 2. Tim. 3. 16.
holy Scripture 4 immediately 5 inspired, which is contained in the books of
the Old and New Testament.

Expos. 4. This word of God has heretofore been diuersely made known. Heb. 1.
1. as by inspiration, 2. Chro. 15. 1. Esa. 59. 21. 2. Pet. 1. 21. Ingrauing in
the heart, Romans 2. 14. visions, Numb. 12. 6. 8. Act. 10. 10, 11. Apo. 1. 10.
Dreams, Job 33. 14. 15. Genesis 40. 8. Vrim and Thummim, Numb. 27. 21. 1. Sam.
30. 7, 8. Signs, Genesis 32. 24. Exodus 13. 21. Audible voice, Exodus 20. 1, 2.
Genesis 22. 11. 15. and lastly by writing, Exodus 17. 14. This word so revealed, is
by excellency called the Scripture, Gal. 3. 22. Io. 10. 35. and the holy
Scriptures, Romans 1. 2. in respect of God the Author, Act. 1. 16. and 4. 25. the
holy penmen, Luke 13. 38. 2. Pet. 1. 21. the matter, 1. Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1.
and end thereof, Romans 15. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 17. The truth of God was delivered to
the Church in writing, Deuteronomy. 31. 9. Hos. 8. 12. Reu. 2. 1. that it might be
preserved pure from corruption, 2. Pet. 1. 12, 13. 15. be better conveyed to
posterity, Ier. 36. 27, 28. Deuteronomy. 31. 9. be an infallible standerd of true
doctrine, and determiner of all controversies, Esa. 8. 2. Mal. 4. 4. Deuteronomy. 17.
11. that our faith might be confirmed beholding the accomplishment of things
prophesied, 1. King 13. 2. comp. 2. King 23. 16. Act. 17. 10. 11. and for the
more full instruction of the Church, the time of the Messiah ever drawing on,
Mal. 4. 4. or being come, Luke 2. 3.

5. To be immediately inspired, is to be as it were breathed, and to come from
the Father by the holy Ghost, without all means. And thus the holy Scriptures
were inspired both for matter, and words. Luke 1. 70. 2. Pet. 1. 21.

Q. What are the books of the Old Testament?
A. Moses, 6 and Luke 24. 27.
the Prophets.

Expos. 6. All the books of holy Scripture given by God to the Church of the
Jews, are called the Law. Luke 16. 17. Ioh. 12. 34. and the Prophets. Romans 1.
2. and 16. 25. 26. because they were written by holy men stirred up,
sanctified, and inspired of God, for that purpose. 1. Pet. 1. 11. Heb. 1. 1.
But ordinarily they are comprised under these two heads, the law and the
Prophets. Matthew. 22. 40. Act. 13. 15. Matthew. 7. 12. or the law of Moses and
the Prophets. Act. 28. 23. or Moses and the Prophets. Ioh. 1. 45. Luke 16. 29.
Moses being distinctly named from the rest because he was the first and chief
of the Prophets: as the Psalms are mentioned particularly. Luke 24. 44.
because they are the choice and flower of all other Scripture.

Q. Which are the books of the new Testament?
A. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the rest as they follow in our Bibles.

Q. How may it be proved that those books are the word of God, immediately
inspired by the holy Ghost to the Prophets and Apostles?
A. 7 By the ^ testimony 2. Pet. 1. 19.
of the Church, 9 constancy Reu. 6. 9.
of the Saints, 10 miracles 1. King 17. 24. Ioh. 3. 2. 1. Ier. 6. 16. Heb. 13.
8.
wrought to confirm the truth, and the 11 Antiquity i thereof.

Expos. 7. It is very expedient and necessary, that all Christians of age and
discreation, should know that the Scriptures are the very word of God, the
immediate and infallible truth of God, that is to be received, obeyed and
believed. For thereby we are the better fitted to hear, read, and rec^eiue the
word with attention, joy, reverence, submission. Act. 10. 33. and assurance of
faith, which being a divine grace must have a divine foundation. 2. Tim. 3. 15,
16. 1. Ioh 5. 9. and being certain must have a sure ground even the word of
God. Ioh. 5. 46. Ephesians. 2. 20. Romans 4. 18. Also it ministers no small comfort in
affliction and temptation that we know whom we have trusted, 2. Tim. 1. 12.
Act. 5. 29. This must be known not by opinion, or probable conjecture which
may deceive, but by certain and distinct knowledge, whereby we conceive of
things certain certainly as they are, and are assured that we conceive of
them none otherwise then as they are; that we may be able to stop the mouths
of Atheists and Papists, who carp against the truth. 2. Cor. 13. 3. We come not
to the understanding hereof by sense, or discourse of reason: this matter is to
be discerned, and believed by faith.

But for the fuller clearing of the point, sundry rules are to be observed,
both concerning faith, and concerning the Scripture it self. 1. Distinction
must be made, between certainty of faith, and certainty of sense or sight.
Things believed, in themselves are more certain then things seen, but they are
not always so apprehended by us. Certainty of sight excludes doubtings, so
does not certainty of faith, it is sufficient that it prevail against them.
Genesis 15. 6. 8. 1. Cor. 13. 9. 12. Iud. 6. 36, 37, 38. 2. Implicit faith, by
which we confusedly believe, that such books are the word of God not
understanding the sense of them, is to be distinguished from explicit faith,
which is ever joined with a distinct and certain understanding of the thing
believed. Ioh. 3. 2. 10. 3. Historical faith, which stands in the certainty of
the mind, and believes God speaking in his word, must be distinguished from
justifying and saving faith, which contains the persuasion and confidence of
the heart, whereby we not only believe the word of God to be the chief truth;
but also do embrace it, as containing the chief good of man. Iam. 2. 19. Ioh.
5. 35. Heb. 6. 11. and 10. 22. Ephesians. 3. 12. for all things in Scripture are not
alike to be believed, neither do the same arguments serve, to beget each
faith. 4. Concerning the Scripture, we must put a difference between the
doctrine therein contained, and the writing: for the sign is for the sense, and
the knowledge and faith of both is not alike necessary. The doctrine was ever
necessary to be believed, the manner of revealing was not always. Ioh. 8. 24.
5. Of doctrines, some are simply necessary to salvation, containing the maine
grounds and chief heads of Christian religion: others are expositions, or
amplifications of the same, very profitable, but not of such necessity. 1.
Cor. 3. 12. 13. Col. 2. 18. 19. Phil. 3. 15. 6. A distinction is to be put
between the Scripture generally considered, in respect of the manner of
revealing, and between the number and order of the Books: it being one thing
to believe that the will of God is now fully and wholly committed to writing:
another that this is the distinct order, and precise number of Books. 7. Also
it is one thing to believe, that God is the author of this or that book;
another to believe that it was written by this or that Scribe or Amanuensis; so
that a difference is to be made between the chief Author of a book, and the
Instrument thereof. 1. Cor. 12. 3. Mat. 10. 20. 8. The substance of doctrine
necessary to salvation contained in Scripture, is to be believed with an
express, historical, and saving faith: but the number and order of books is
to be believed with faith historical.

8. By the Church we understand not the Pope, whom the Papists call the Church
virtuall; nor his Bishops and Cardinals met in a general Council, whom they
call the Church representative; but the whole company of believers, who have
professed the true faith, whether those who received the books of holy
Scripture from the Prophets and Apostles; or those who lived after. Under the
name of the Church we comprehend not the Prophets and Apostles, as they were
immediately chosen and called to be the penmen of holy Scripture; for they
wrote not as men in the Church, but above the Church. The Church of the Jews
professed the doctrine, and received the Books of the old Testament, and
testified of them that they were divine. To whose testimony these things give
force: 1. To them were committed the Oracles of God. Romans 3. 2. 2. In great
misery they have constantly confessed the same, when as by the only denying
thereof, they might have been partakers both of liberty and rule. 3.
Notwithstanding the high Priests and others persecuted the Prophets whiles they
lived, yet they received their writings as prophetical and divine. 4. Since
obstinacy is come to Israel, notwithstanding their great hatred to the
Christian religion, the holy Scripture of the old Testament, is kept pure and
vncorrupt amongst them, even in those places which do evidently confirm the
truth of Christian religion. Esa. 53. 3, 4, 5, etc. The Christian Church has
embraced the doctrine of God, and received the books both of the Old and
New Testament. To whose testimony two things give weight: 1. their great
constancy. 2. their admirable and sweet consent: for in other matters we may
observe differences in opinions, in this a singular and wonderful agreement.
This testimony of Christians is considered three ways; 1. Of the universal
Church, which from the beginning thereof until these times, professing the
Christian religion to be divine, does also profess that these books are of
God. 2. Of the several primative Churches, which first received the books of
the old Testament, and the Epistles written from the Apostles to them, their
Pastors, or to some they knew, and after delivered the^ under the same title,
to their successors, and other Churches. 3. Of the Pastors and Doctors, who
(being furnished with skill, both in the tongues and matters divine,) upon due
trial and examination have pronounced their judgment, and approved them to
the people committed to their charge. This testimony is of great weight and
importance, profitable to prepare the heart, and to move it to believe; of all
humane testimonies whereby the author of any book that has, is, or shall be
extant, can be proved, the greatest, both in respect of the multitude,
wisdom, honesty, faithfulness of the witnesses, and the likeness,
constancy, and continuance of the Testimony it self. But this testimony is
only humane; not the only, not the chief, whereby the truth and divinity of
the Scripture is confirmed, neither can it be the ground of divine faith and
assurance.

9. The Saints of God of all sorts and conditions, noble, base, rich, poor,
learned, unlearned, old, young, married, unmarried, etc have suffered the most
grievous torments, usual, unusual, speedy, slow, even what hell could
invent, or man's malice find out, for the defense of this truth. All these
things a number numberles endured, and that with great constancy and joy, even
with a cheerful heart, and merry countenance, so that none can think they
suffered out of weakness, pride, vainglory, or discontent. This the patient
suffering of the Martyrs is not a testimony merely humane, but partly divine:
for that courage, and cheerefulnes which they showed in the midst of all
torments, was not from nature but from above.

10. Many and great wonders, such as Satan himself cannot imitate, such as
exceed the power of any, yea of all the creatures in the world, such as the
most malicious ene^ies of Gods truth, could not deny to be divine, has the
Lord openly wroug^t by the hands of Moses, the Prophets, and Apostles, for the
confirmation of this truth. Numb. 11. 9. and 20. 10. Exodus 19. 16. 1. King 17.
24. Mark. 16. 20. H^b. 2. 4 Ioh. 5. 36. and 9. 30. 33. Act. 5. 12. These
miracles were sufficient to confirm the divinity of this truth, and writing,
to them who were eie-witnesses thereof. Heb. 2. 3. Ioh. 20. 20. Judge. 2. 7. 10.
The undoubted and clear narration of them, is to us an invincible argument
thereof.

11. That which is most ancient, is most true and divine, the purest religion
is before all others; there must needs be a law before transgression; and a
commandment given unto man, before there could be place for the Devil to
tempt him. But the religion taught in Scripture is of greatest antiquity; the
doctrine of the creation and fall is their handled, in all other stories
whatsoever is omitted.

Q. How else?
A. By 12 the Genesis 17. 1. Psalm. 50. 1. Esa. 44. 24. Exodus 20. 1. 2. 1. Cor. 11.
23. Ioh. 3. 36. 1. Cor. 1. 23. Joel. 1. 1. 2.

13 efficacy, sweet Genes. 3. 15. and 49. 10. Esa. 9. 6. Dan. 9. 24. Matthew.
1. 18. Act. 10. 43.
14 consent, admirable Psa. 119. 129. 138. 172. Deuteronomy. 4. 5, 6.
15 doctrine, excellent Ioh. 20. 31.
16 end, and the witness 2. Tim. 3. 16. 2. Pet. 1. 19.
17 of the Scripture it self.

Expos. 12. By the style of Scripture, we understand not the external
superficies of words, but the whole order, character, frame, and comprehension,
which fitly agrees to the dignity of the speaker, and nature of the argument,
and is tempered according to the capacity and condition of them for whose sakes
it was written. Indeed every Prophet and Apostle almost, had a peculiar style;
Esaias is eloquent, sweet, and more adorned; Solomon accurate, Jeremy vehement,
and more rough; Amos simple, but all are divine. These things declare the
majesty of the style: 1. The titles that the author of holy Scripture does
justly challenge unto himself, which import independance of nature, Exodus 3.
14. supereminencie of power and sovereignty, Psalm. 50. 1. 2. excellency both
of properties and works, Genesis 17. 1. Esa. 42. 5. and 40 12* 26. 2. The manner
used in teaching, commanding, promising, and threatening. Things above reason,
hidden mysteries, such as exceed all humane capacity, are unfolded, without
all argumentation or furniture of persuasion, 1. Cor. 2. 7. and we are
required to understand and believe them, relying upon the truth and credit of
the reuealer. In giving the law, no proeme is used, but, Thus says the Lord;
no conclusion, but, The Lord has spoken. Exodus 20. 1. 2. Commandments of
which no reason can be rendered, are enjoined. Genesis 2. 17. and that which a
natural man would account foolishnes, is peremptorily and with great security
required, Ioh. 3. 36. 1. Cor. 1. 23. 24. no argument being brought to
persuade, or confirm the equity of those commands, but only the will of the
Commander. Promises above likelihood are made, to assure of performance; no
reason is alleged, but, I the Lord have spoken, Esa. 51. 22. and 52. 3. 4. and
to encourage against difficulties and dangers present, divine assistance is
promised both as necessary and sufficient. Ex. 4. 12. Ios. 1. 9. Ier. 1. 8.
Esa. 43. 5. In the manner of threatening also, the like notes of the divinity
of the style may be observed. 3. That without respect of persons, he does
prescribe laws to all men, private persons, and public Magistrates, whole
Kingdoms, and several estates, commanding what is distasteful to their
nature, and forbidding what they approve, promising not terrene honor, but
life everlasting if they be obedient; threatening not with rack or gybbet, but
eternal death if they disobey. Joel. 1. 1, 2. Io. 3. 16. 1. Sam. 12. 25. 4.
That the Ministers of the Lord of Hosts do require attention, faith, and
obedience, to whatsoever they speak in the name of the Lord, whether it were
prophecy, commandment, or rebuke; whether they called to repentance, and
reformation of things amiss, or exhorted to obedience. 1. Cor. 11. 23. Mic. 1.
1. 2. The low and humble manner of speech, used in holy Scripture, cannot
justly offend any man; for it was penned to the use and behoof both of the
learned and unlearned. Romans 1. 14. though the phrase be plain, the matter is
high and excellent, profound and unutterable. Hos. 8. 12. Act. 2. 11. Easiness
and plainness does best beseem the truth: a pearl needs not painting, nor
truth to be underpropped with foreign aids, it is of it self sufficient to
uphold and sustain it self: it becomes not the Majesty of a Prince to play
the Orator; and though the Scripture be simple in word, it is great in power:
no writings of Man though never so well set forth, with wit, words, order, or
depth of learning, can so inlighten the mind, move the will, pierce the heart,
or stir up the affections, as does the word of God. Neither do the Scriptures
want eloquence, if the matter be well weighed; no writing does, or can
equalize them in pithinesse of prophesying, or feruentnesse of praying. The
song of Moses, and the beginning of Esaias, in variety and force of eloquence,
do far exceed all autors, Greek and Latin; if comparison be made betwixt
those places and whatsoever is most excelle^tly indicted by man, either in
Greek or Latin, you may easily discern, the one was written by a divine, the
other by an humane spirit.

13. The efficacy of this doctrine does powerfully demonstrate the divinity
thereof; for it conuertes the soul, illightens the eyes, Psa. 19. 7, 8.
discouers sin, Romans 7. 7. conuinces the gainsaier, 2. Tim 3. 16. kills and
terrifieth, 2. Cor. 3. 6. rejoices the heart, Psalm. 19. 8. Psalm. 119. 103.
quickneth, Psalm. 119. 50. 93. and comfort, Romans 15. 4. manifests the
thoughts. 1. Cor. 14. 25. overthrows false religions, casts down strong
holds, and the whole kingdom of Satan, stops the mouth of Oracles, destroies
Idols. 2. Cor. 10. 4. Zeph. 2. 11. Zach. 13. 2. and remains invincible
notwithstanding all opposition. Act. 5. 38. 39. These things commend the
efficacy of this word. 1. The nature thereof is opposite to the wisdom and
will of a natural man. 1. Cor. 1. 21. and 2. 14. Romans 8. 6. and yet it has
prevailed. 2. It has prevailed, not only with the gross, and sottish
Gentiles, who served other Gods, Gal. 4. 8. but even with the most feirce and
bitter enemies thereof. Act. 9. 5. 6. 20. 21. 3. The enemies who did oppose
this truth, were many, mighty, and subtle; as principally the Devil out of
his hatred against Gods glory, and man's salvation. Ephesians. 6. 12. Apo. 2. 10. and
the Roman Emperors as his instruments, the rest of the world furthering, and
the Jews, stirring them up; all which out of their love to falsehood and
Idolatry, and their malice against the Christian religion, did with incredible
fury, and vigilancie, labor the vtrer abolition of this truth. Act. 4. 27. and
9. 2. Matthew. 10. 18. 22 Io. 16. 2. Act. 13. 50. and 14. 2. 5. 19. 1. These. 2.
15. 16. 4. The persons whom the Lord did choose to be publishers of this
heavenly doctrine, were in number few, in outward appearance simple, rude,
base, and weak; and sometimes also negligent. Matthew. 4. 18. 19. 20. Luke 6.
13. 2. Cor. 4. 7. 8. Matthew. 13. 25. 5. These simple and weak men, subdued the
world by preaching the Cross of Christ, and prescribing long suffering, and
patience. 1. Cor. 2. 4. 1. These.. 3. 4. Act. 9. 16. 2. Tim. 3. 12. The number
of all sorts, ages, condititions, sexes, and nations who gave credit to this
doctrine, and confirmed the same with the loss of their lives, was
innumerable. Apo. 6. 9. 10. 7. In short time a great part of the habitable
world was converted and brought to the obedience of faith, so that Paul filled
all places from Jerusalem to Illyricum, with the sound of the Gospel. Col. 1.
6. Romans 35. 19. 8. The more the truth was persecuted, the more it did prevail.
Act. 8. 3. 4. Phil. 1. 14. 9. Though the Jews were wasted with many and great
slaughters, yet the Scriptures did still remain safe, and entire in their
custody: when the Hebrew language did lie almost unknown, and had perished
altogether, had not the Lord provided for religion; then by the Jews the
deadly enemies of Christ, was the doctrine of Christian faith preserved. 10. To
these we may add, the dreadful judgments of God, which fell upon the
persecutors of the Christian faith; amongst whom, some were forced at their
last gasp, to acknowledge the divinity of this word. All which things do
strongly confirm, the propagation, defense, and conseruauation of this truth
and doctrine, to be admirable and of God.

14. The sweette and admirable consent which is found in all and every part of
Scripture, cannot be ascribed to any but the Spirit of God; each part so
exactly agreeing with it self and with the whole. Io. 5. 46. This may
sufficiently appear, by comparing the prophesies of the old Testament touching
Christ, the calling of the Gentiles, and reiection of the Jews, with the
accomplishment of them, declared in the New. Genesis 3. 15. and 12. 4. and 49.
10. Numb. 14. 17. Dan. 9. 25. Matthew. 1. 18. Luke 1. 55. and 24. 27. 44. Act.
26. 22. Deuteronomy. 32. 21. Mal. 1. 10. 11. Psalm 2. 8. and 110. 2. Act. 11. 18. Psalm.
118. 22. 23. Matthew. 21. 42. Such exact consent as here is to be found, is
impossible to be fained of men, or Angels, as the things foretold were removed
from their knowledge and finding out, until they were revealed. These
considerations give strength to this argument. 1. The length of time in which
this writing continued, viz. from Moses until John, which prevented all
conceits of forgery, since they were not written in one, nor yet in many ages.
2. The multitude of books that were written, and of writers who were employed
in that service. 3. The distance of place, in which they were written, which
did hinder that the writers could not confer together. Ier. 2. 1. 2. and 36.
5. Ezeck. 1. 1. 4. The silence of the adversaries, who in all that long space
mentioned, whiles the Scripture was in writing; could never detect any thing in
those books, as false, or erroneous; whose silence is of great weight in this
case, because they were eye witnesses of those things which our Savior taught,
did and suffered, according as it was prophesied of him, so that they know the
prophesies, sau^ the accomplishment of them, and were acquainted with that
which the Apostles had written. If the Prophets or Apostles, who wrote the same
histories, do seem to dissent in any circumstances, this does nothing
derogate from their authority; for in themselves they differ not, the fault is
our ignorance, and apprehension: by a right and just interpretation, they may
easily be reconciled; and the dissonancy which seems to be amongst them in
small things, does free them from all suspicion of fraud; and their sweet
consent in all matters of importance, does convince that they wrote by the
guidance of the same Spirit. If they had all written one thing, they might
seem superfluous; if each a new history, there could appear no steps of
consent; when they relate the same story with the same circumstances, they have
their use, one sometimes speaking more plainly then the other; and when they
agree in matter, but seem to dissent in circumstance, the truth is the more
confirmed, an argument of fuller credit may be drawn out of that dissent; for
as the Heathen man observes, too exact diligence is neither approved of al,
neither does it want suspicion. To this sweet agreement of holy Scripture with
it self, it might be further added, that it agrees with all other truth
whatsoever; there is nothing true in divinity, which is false in Philosophy;
nothing in Phylosophie is repugnant to the truth in divinity, but it may be
overthrown by the principles of right and true Phylosophie.

15. The matter entreated of in holy Scripture is divine and wonderful. It
explicats unto us, the nature, properties, and high acts of God, purely and
holily. It describs the person of Christ, so fitly, excellently, and
conveniently, that if the mind of man consider it attentively, of necessity it
must acknowledge, that it does exceed the reach of a finite understanding. It
discouers unto us the misery and corruption of man by nature, incomprehensible
love of God in Jesus Christ toward man, that happy reconciliation (if we may
so speak) of his justice and mercy by his infinite wisdom, ordaining Jesus
Christ to be our Mediator, and it unfolds the covenant of grace which God made
with man after his fall; all which can be drawn from no fountain but divine
revelation. 1. Cor. 2. 7. 8. Ephesians. 3. 4. 5. Col. 1. 26. The Scripture also
contains the law of God, which teaches the duty of man, and that is wise
and just, the Gentiles themselves being judges. Deu. 4. 5. 6. 7. In the
precepts, diverse notes of divinity may be observed; as 1. The surpassing
excellency of the act, requiring that we should deny our selves, and lead our
lives according to the appointment of the Lord. Matthew. 16. 24. 25. Romans 8. 12.
13. 2. The wonderful equity that does appear in every commandment. 3. The
admirable strangenes of some acts, which a natural man would count foolishnes,
yet prescribed as necessary. Io. 3. 36. and 8. 24. 4. The manner how obedience
is required, viz. that it proceed from a pure heart, a good conscience, and
faith unfeigned. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. 1. Cor. 13. 2. 1. Tim. 1. 5. 5. And the perfection
of the law commanding and allowing all good, but forbidding and condemning all
sin and wickedness, of what kind soever. Take a brief veiwe of the ten
commandments, are they not plain, pure, brief, perfect, just, extending to
all, binding the conscience, and reaching to the very thoughts? and do not all
these things commend unto us the justice, wisdom, holiness, omnipotency,
omniscience, perfection, and absolute sovereignty of the lawgiuer? The promises
and threatenings annexed to the law, will suffer us to acknowledge none other
author of them but the Lord alone: for none can make them but he, he only can
give eternal life, and inflict eternal condemnation. Moreover these are so
set together with the commandments, as they can move none, but only the
conscience of him who does acknowledge the Commandments to be divine.

16. The end of the Scripture is divine, viz. the glory of God, and the
salvation of man, not temporal but eternal. The doctrines, precepts,
prohibitions, and narrations, are all referred to the setting forth of Gods
praise, which shows that they are from above. Ioh. 7. 18. and 5. 41. and 8.
50. 54. Gal. 1. 10. And to speak truth, what is more equal, then that all
things should return thither, whence they had their beginning. This word also
does point out unto man, what true blessedness is, and how he may be reconciled
unto God, being lost by sin; which is a firm demonstration to prove unto
us the divinity thereof: for what is more agreeable to the wisdom, bounty,
mercy, grace, and power of God, then to restore man fallen, and to make him
partakers of eternal happiness? and who can show unto man how he may be
admitted into Gods favor having offended, or direct and lead him forward in
the path of life, but the Lord alone? These arguments are of great force,
whether they be severally or jointly considered, and do as strongly prove
that the Christian Religion is only true, as any other reason can, that there
was, is, or ought to be any true religion.

17. This testimony of Scripture it self is most clear, certain,
infallible, public, and of it self worthy credit, it being the testimony
of the Lord himself, who is in all things to be believed: But the external
light of arguments, and testimonies brought to confirm and demonstrate, must
be distinguished from the inward operation of the holy Ghost, opening our eyes
to see the light shining in the Scripture, and to discern the sense thereof. 2.
Cor. 1. 22,

Q. These reasons may convince any be he never so obstinate, but are they
sufficient to persuade the heart hereof?
A. No: the testimony of the 18 Spirit is necessary 1. Cor. 2. 14.
, and only all-sufficient for this purpose. r. 1. Ioh. 2. 20. 27.


Expos. 18. By nature we are blind in spiritual things, 1. Cor. 2. 14. Matthew.
15. 14. though therefore the Scripture be a shining light, Psalm. 119. 105. yet
unless our eyes be opened, Psalm. 119. 18. Act. 26. 18. we cannot see it, no
more then a blind man does the Sun, Ioh. 1. 5. The Spirit is the author of
supernatural light and faith, 1. Cor. 2. 8, 9. Ephesians. 1. 17. 1. Ioh. 5. 6. 10. by
the inspiration thereof were the Scriptures written, 2. Pet. 1. 21. the secrets
of God are fully known unto, and effectually revealed by the Spirit, 1. Cor.
2. 10. the same law which is written in the Scriptures, the Spirit does write
in the hearts of men that be endued therewith. Esa. 59. 21. Heb. 8. 10. For
which reasons it must needs be, that the testimony of the Spirit is
all-sufficient to persuade, and assure the heart that the Scriptures are the
word of God. To prevent mistaking therein, observe these rules. 1. The Spirit
of God does assuredly persuade our consciences that the Scriptures are of God,
by enlightening our eyes to behold the light, writing the law in our hearts,
sealing up the promises to our consciences, and causing us sensibly to feel
the effects thereof, 1. Cor. 2. 12. Luke 24. 45. 1. Cor. 14. 37. Ier. 31. 33. 2.
Cor. 1. 22. 1. These. 1. 5. with 1. These. 2. 13. Act. 16. 14. 2. This persuasion
of the Spirit, is more certain then can be proved with reason, or expressed
in words: for things doubtful may be proved, but things in themselves most
clear and certain, be above all proof and reason, as the shining of the Sun
needs not to be confir^ed by argument to him that has his eyes open to see
the light thereof. 3. This testimony of the Holy Ghost, is certain and
manifest to him that has the Spirit, but private not public, testifying
only to him who is endued thereof; but not conuincing others, not confirming
doctrines to others. 4. This testimony of the Spirit is not to be severed from
the word, which is the instrument of the holy Ghost, and his public
testimony. It is not therefore injurious to try the Spirit by the word of
God, 1. Ioh. 4. 1. seeing there is a mutual relation between the truth of the
party witnessing, and the truth of the thing witnessed; and the holy Spirit
the author of the Scripture, is every where like unto, and does every where
agree with himself. 5. The testimony of the Spirit does not teach or assure
us of the letter^, syllabes, or several words of holy Scripture, which are
only as a vessel, to carry and convey that heavenly light unto v^; but it does
seal in our hearts the saving truth contained in those sacred writings; into
what language soever they be translated. Ephesians. 1. 13. 6. The Spirit does not
lead them in whom it dwells, absolu^ly and at once into all truth, but into
all truth necessary to salvation, and by degrees. Ioh. 16. 13. with Act. 1. 6.
and 11. 2. so that holy men partakers of the same Spirit, may err in many
things, and dissent one from another in matters not fundamental.

Q. What are the properties of the Scripture?
A. It is of 19 Divine 2. Tim. 3. 16.
authority, the rule 20 of Eccl. 12. 10. Gal. 6. 16.
faith and manners, 21 Romans 10. 14.
necessary, 22 Psalm. 12. 6.
pure, 23 Psalm. 19. 7.
perfect, and 24 Prou. 8. 9.
plain.

Expos. 19. Such is the excellency of the holy Scripture, above all other
writings whatsoever, 2. Tim. 3. 15. 2. Pet. 1. 19. that it ought to be credited
in all narrations, threatenings, promises, or prophesies. 1. Tim. 1. 15. Heb.
11. 11. 2. Pet. 1. 19. and obeyed in all commandments. Job 22. 22. Ier. 13.
15. Romans 1. 5. God the Author thereof, being of incomprehensible wisdom,
Psa. 147. 5. great goodness, Exodus 18. 9. Psa. 34. 8. Romans 11. 22. absolute
power and dominion, Genesis 17. 1. Psalm. 50. 1, ^. and truth, that can neither
deceive nor be deceived. Romans 3. 4. Tit. 1. 2. Heb. 6. 18. The authority of the
Scripture does only and wholly depend upon God the author of it; and therefore
though one part may be preferred before another, in respect of excellency of
matter and use, Cant. 1. 1. 1. Tim. 1. 15. in authority and certainty every
part is equal, and only Scripture is of divine authority. Gal. 1. 8. Mat.
17. 5. 1. Cor. 11. 23.

20. The Scriptures are the word of Christ, Col. 3. 16. whose word is upright,
Eccl. 12. 10. Phil. 3. 16. the first truth, Heb. 13. 8. received by immediate,
divine revelation, 2. Pet. 1. 21. and delivered to the Church; sufficient to
make the man of God perfect in all good works, 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. the treasury
whence all doctrines must be taken, 1. Pet. 4. 11. Act 26. 22. Luke 16. 29. the
touchstone whereby they must be tried, Act. 17. 11. Esa. 8. 20. without which,
error in doctrine and manners is unavoidable. Matthew. 22. 29.

21. In respect of substance, the word of God was always necessary, Ephesians. 2.
20: without which we could neither know nor worship God aright. Heb. 11. 3. 6.
Matthew. 22. 29. Ioh. 20. 31. 2. Tim. 3 16. Romans 15. 4. Luke 24. 26, 27. In
respect of the manner of revealing in writing, the Scriptures were neeessarie,
ever since it pleased God after that manner to make known his will. Deuteronomy. 17.
18. Josh 1. 8. Romans 15. 4. Luke 1. 3. Jude v. 3. and so shall be to the end of
the world. 1. Cor. 10. 11. Reu. 22. 18.

22. This blessed word of God is free from all, even the least stain of
folly, error, falsehood, or injustice, Psalm. 119. 138. 140. Prou. 30. 5. Ioh.
17. 17. all things being laid down holily and truly, both for substance,
circumstance, and manner of speaking. Psalm. 51. 1. Matthew. 1. 25.

23. Whatsoever was, is, or shall be necessary, or profitable to be known,
believed, practiced, or hoped for, that is fully comprehended in the books of
the Prophets, and Apostles. Luke 16. ^9. 31. Io. 5. 39. Romans 15. 4. Gal. 1. 8.
9. 2. Tim. 3. 15. 16. 17. The perfection of the Scripture will more plainly
appear if we consider; 1. That religion for the substance thereof was ever one
and unchangeable. Heb. 13. 8. Ephesians. 4. 5. Jude. 3. Act. 26. 22. Tit. 1. 1. 2. 2.
The law of God written by Moses and the Prophets, did deliver whatsoever was
needful for, and behoouefull to the salvation of the Israelits. Deuteronomy. 4. 2.
and 12. 32. Psa. 1. 2. Mal. 4. 4. Hos. 8. 12. Luke 10. 26. 3. Our Savior made
known unto his disciples the last and full will of his heavenly Father. Io. 14.
26. and. 15. 15. and 16. 13. and 1. 18. and what they received of him, they
faithfully preached unto the world. Act. 20. 27. 1. Cor. 15. 1. 2. 3. Gal. 1.
8. 1. Io. 1. 3. and the sum of what they preached, is committed to writing.
Act. 1. 1. 2. Io. 20. 31. 1. Io. 5. 13. with Act. 8. 5. 1. 1. Cor. 2. 2. Romans
10. 8. 9. 10. 4. There is nothing necessary to be known of Christians, over
and above that which is found in the old Testament, which is not plainly,
clearly, and fully set down, and to be gathered out of the writings of the
Apostles and Evangelists. In the whole body of the Scripture, all doubts and
controversies are perfectly decided. Es. 8. 20. Math. 22. 29. 40. Deuteronomy. 17. 8.
9. 10. 11. 12. 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. and every particular book is sufficiently
perfect for the proper end thereof. Unwritten traditions. 1. Cor. 4. 6. new
articles of faith. Ier. 7. 3. and 19. 5. and new visions and revelations are
now to be rejected. Heb. 1. 1. Io. 4. 25. Io. 15. 15. and 16. 13. with Matthew.
28. 19. 2. Cor. 3. 6. 8. 11. with Heb. 8. 13.

24. In themselves the whole Scripture is easy, Psalm. 119. 105. 2. Pet. 1. 19.
Prou. 14. 6. such excellent matter could not be delivered in more significant
and fit words. Act. 1. 16. with Ephesians. 1. 17. But all things in Scripture are not
alike manifest. 2. Pet. 3. 16. The Gentiles by nature have the law written in
their hearts. Romans 2. 14. but to a natural man the Gospel is obscure,
accounted foolishnes. 1. Cor. 1. 21. and. 2. 14. Things necessary to salvation
are so clearly laid down, that the simplest endued with the Spirit, cannot be
altogether ignorant of the same. Es. 54. 13. Io. 6. 45. Deu. 30. 11. Matthew. 11.
25. 2. Cor. 4. 3. But to them who are in part illightned. 1. Cor. 33. 12. many
things are obscure and dark. 1. Cor. 13. 9. to tame the pride of man's nature.
2. Cor. 12. 7. work in us a reverence to the Scripture. 2. Pet. 3. 16. 17. 18.
stir us up with care and diligence to read, pray, hear. etc. and use Gods
means to grow in knowledge. Pro. 2. 3. 4. 5. and acknowledge that all heavenly
wisdom does come from above. Pro. 2. 6. Iam. 1. 5. 1. King 3. 9. Job. 28. 32.

Q. For what end was the Scripture writt^n?
A. To 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. Romans 15. 4.
teach, ^5 instruct, convince, correct, and comfort.

Expos. 25. Faith and obedience is the way to happiness, and the whole duty of
man is faith working by love, Romans 1. 5. Tit. 1. 1, 2. 2. Tim. 1. 13. Gal. 5.
6. and 6. 15. which is assaulted with ignorance, error, superstition and
prophanenes. 1. Tim. 1. 6. 19. 20. 2. Pet. 2. 1. 2. 3. and beset with many
afflictions. 2. Tim. 3. 12. Therefore the Scripture which was given to show
unto man the way of life and salvation, was also written to teach found
Doctrine, improoue error, correct iniquity, instruct to righteousness, and
comfort in the path of holiness. 1. Tim. 1. 10. 11. Tit. 2. 12. 1. These. 3. 3.
4. Heb. 12. 1. 2.

Q. Does the knowledge of the Scriptures belong unto all men.
A. Yes: 26 all men are not only allowed Io. 5. 39.
, but exhorted and Deuteronomy. 17. 18. 19. Reu. 1. 3.
commanded to read, hear, and Act. 8. 30.
understand the Scripture.

Expos. 26. The Scriptures teach the way of life. Pro. 2. 9. Luke 16. 29. Act.
24. 14. and 13. 46. Psalm. 16. 11. Io. 6. 68. set forth the duties of every man
in his place and estate of life. Deuteronomy. 17. 17. 18. 19. 20. Josh. 1. 8. Psalm.
119. 28. 2. Chro. 23. 11. 1. Tim. 4. 14. and 5. 1. etc. 2. Tim. 3. 16. 17. are
the ground of faith, Romans 4. 20. 2. Chro. 20. 20. 1. Tim. 1. 15. the Epistle of
God sent to his Church. Hos. 8. 12. Reu. 2. 1. 8. 12. his Testament, wherein we
may find what legacies he has bequeathed unto us. 2. Cor. 3. 6. 14. Heb. 10.
16. Io. 14. 17. the sword of the Spirit. Ephesians. 6. 17. being known and embraced
make a man happy. Psalm. 119. 97. 98. Luke 10. 42. and 16. 29. Psalm. 1. 2. Reu.
1. 3. but neglected or contemned, plunge men into all misery. Heb. 2. 3. Matthew.
22. 29. Psalm. 50. 16. therefore all men of what age, estate, quality, or degree
soever, ought to acquaint themselves with the word of God. 1. Io. 2. 14. 15.
Psalm. 119. 9. Act. 17. 11. Deuteronomy. 6. 7. Act. 18. 25. 28. for it was given of
God, for the benefit and behoof of all sorts. Romans 1. 14. being milk for
babes, and meat for strong men. 1. Cor. 3. 1. 2. Heb. 5. 13. plain and easy
to inctruct the simple. Pro. 1. 4. Psa. 19. 7. and full of hidden wisdom to
exercise the strong, and satisfy the wise. Col. 2. 3. 1. Cor. 2. 7. Pro. 1. 5.
that both sorts may be able to try the Spirits. 1. Io. 4. 1. be wise unto
salvation, and grow rich in all spiritual knowledge and understanding. Col.
1. 10. and 2. 2. and 3. 16.

Q. The Scriptures were written in Hebrewe and Greek, how then should all men
read and understand them?
A. They ought to be 1. Cor. 14. 18. 19.
translated 27 into known tongues, Neh. 88. Act. 8. 35.
and 28 interpreted.

Expos. 27. The Prophets and Apostles preached their doctrines to the people
and nations in their known languages. Ier. 36. 15. 16. Act. 2. 6. Immediately
after the Apostles times, many translations were extant. All things must be
done in the congregation unto edifying. 1. Cor. 14. 26. but an unknown tongue
does not edify. Genesis 11. 4. and all are commanded to try the Spirits. 1.
These. 5. 21. 1. Cor. 10. 15.

28. The expounding of the Scriptures is commanded by God. 1. Cor. 14. 1. 3.
4. 5. 39. and practiced by the godly. Luke 4. 16. and 24. 27. Matthew. 1. 23. 1.
Cor. 14. 19. profitable both for the unfolding of obscure places. Neh. 8. 8.
and applying of plain texts. 1. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 28. 29. It stands in two
things: 1. In giving the right sense. Matthew. 13. 38. Act. 2. 29. 30. Gal. 3.
16. 2. In a fit application of the same. Act. 2. 16. and 1. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 24.
2. Pet. 1. 12. Of one place of Scripture, there is but one proper and natural
sense, though sometimes things things are so expressed, as that the things
themselves do signify other things according to the Lords ordinance. Gal. 4.
22. 23. 24. Ex. 12. 46. with. 10. 19. 36. Psa. 2. 1. with. Act. 4. 24. 25. 26.
We are not tied to the expositions of Fathers, or Councels, for the finding out
of the sense of the Scripture. Romans 3. 4. Matthew. 5. 27. 28. 31. 32. 33. 34. 38.
39. 43. 44. the holy Ghost speaking in the Scripture, is the only faithful
interpreter of the Scripture. Luke 1. 70. 1. Cor. 2. 10. 11. 10. 14. 26. Es.
55. 4. The means to find out the true meaning of the Scripture, are conference
of one place of Scripture with another. 2. Sam. 24. 1. with 1. Chro. 21. 1.
Esa. 28. 16. with. Romans 9. 33. Es. 65. 1. 2. with Romans 10. 20. 21. Mic. 5. 2.
with Matthew. 2. 6. Matthew. 26. 34. with Mar. 14. 30. diligent consideration of
the scope and circumstances of the place. Matthew. 22. 31. 32. Act. 2. ^9. as the
occasions, and coherence of that which went before, with that which follows
after; the matter whereof it does entreat. 1. Co. 11. 24. 25. 26. and
circumstances of persons, times, and places. Act. 13. 36. 37. and
consideration, whether the words be spoken figuratively or simply; for in
figurative speeches, not the outward show of words, but the sense is to be
taken. Io. 15. 1. Matthew. 26. 26. Io. 14. 6. Ex. 12. 11. Io. 6. 35. 1. Cor. 10.
16. and knowledge of the Arts and Tongues wherein the Scriptures were
originally written. 1. Cor. 12. 10. Act. 2. 3. 4. But always it is to be
observed, that obscure places, are not to be expounded contrary to the rule of
faith set down in plainer places of the Scripture. Romans 3. 18. 20. and 12. 6.
2. Tim. 1. 13. Act. 13. 33. 36. 37. Romans 6. 7.

Q. What does the Scripture especially teach v^?
A. The 1 saving Io. 17. 3. Col. 2. 1. 2.
knowledge 2 of God 3 and Jesus Christ.

Expos. 1. Knowledge is the ground of obedience. 1. Chro. 28. 9. Act. 26. 18. a
rich gift of grace. Mar. 4. 11. the first grace that God gives unto his
children. 1. Io. 2. 20. 27. and 5. 20. Io. 16. 4. and 6. 63. the foundation of
all other graces. Pro. 19. 2. Psalm. 9. 10. Hos. 4. 4. Es. 11. 9. the guide of
our affections, and directer of our actions. Psalm. 119. 9. 100. 101. Pro. 2.
10. 11. 12. Es. 30. 21. without which zeal is little worth. Romans 10. 2.
sacrifice was vain, Hos. 6. 6. and devotion was but superstition, Act. 7. 22.
23. This when it is made by the work of the holy Ghost, to be effectual to
sincere faith, love, fear, and obedience, is saving. Ioh. 17. 3. Esa. 53. 11.

2. We must know God, because otherwise we cannot desire, Ioh. 4. 10. obey, 1.
Ioh. 2. 4. nor have communion or fellowship with him. 1. Ioh. 1. 5, 6, 7.

3. We must know Christ, because sin has made a separation between God and
us, Esa. 59. 2. so that we cannot be received into Gods favor, or have
communion with him, without a Mediator. Ephesians. 1. 3. 5. Romans 3. 25. Ephesians. 2. 18.
1. Ioh. 2. 1, 2. Heb. 10. 21. 22. Ioh. 14. 6. and God in Christ, or God and
Christ, is the object of Christian religion. Col. 3. 17. 1. Pet. 1. 21. Ioh.
14. 1. Heb. 1. 6. Christ is the image of the invisible God, Col. 1. 15. the
brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, Heb. 1. 3. in
whom, with open face we behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, 2. Cor.
3. 18. Ioh. 14. 9. in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,
Col. 2. 3. The Apostles who preached unto the world the whole counsel of God
necessary to salvation, did preach nothing, Act. 8. 5. Romans 10. 8, 9. Act. 28.
31. did desire to know nothing, but Jesus Christ and him crucified. 1. Cor. 2.
2. Phil. 3. 8. of him they wrote, that our joy might be full. 1. Ioh. 1. 4. and
the Lord who forbids us to glory in any thing beside, does command us to glory
in this, that we know him in Christ. Ier. 9. 23. 1. Cor. 1. 30, 31. so that
this knowledge is necessary, easy, excellent, sufficient, sound and
comfortable. 2. Cor. 4. 3. 4. Act. 8. 8.

Q. How may it be proved that there is a God?
A. By the 1 Psa. 19. 1. 2. Esa. 41. 23. Romans 1. 20. Act. 14. 17. Job 12. 7, 8,
9.
works and Exodus 8. 19. and 9. 16.
2 wonders which are seen, the testimony Romans 2. 15. Esa. 33. 14. Psalm. 14.
5. and 53. 5.
of 3 conscience, the Zach. 12. 1. Psalm. 94. 8, 9, 10.
powers 4 of the soul, and the Revel. 12. 7. 10.
practices 5 of Satan.

Expos. 1. The first creature was made of nothing, otherwise it could not be
subject to change and alteration: and all creatures are finite, compound,
imperfect, unable to make or sustain themselves; therefore of necessity there
must be a first cause, in power infinite, most perfect, and of it self, that
gives being and continuance unto all things. 2* Nothing can be the cause of it
self, for then it should be both the cause and the effect, both before and
after it self: therefore all things have their beginning from one first and
supreme cause, which is God. 3. Amongst things created we may observe a series
of causes, and an order in the things themselves; but order is from one first,
and leads us unto one first. 4. All things, even things without life, sense,
and reason, which cannot moon voluntarily, or intend an end, are directed
orderly unto an end: therefore there is one wise, good, and chief directer of
all things, which is God. 5. The greatness, perfection, multitude, variety,
and concord of things existing; the form, and continual sustentation of the
world, do show that all things do depend upon some one, wise, and perfect
good, from whom they have their being and preservation.

2. By Wonders, we understand visible and apparent works, extraordinarily
wrought, not only above the ordinary course of nature, but simply above the
power of nature, either in respect of the work it self, or the manner of
doing* which effects do convince, that there i^ an infinite power that is
above, and does overrule all things: for every principal and primarie cause,
is more excellent then the effects thereof.

3. The conscience does register, bring to remembrance, and bear witness of
^he cogitations, words, and actions of all men: excuse and comfort in weldoing,
against the disgraces, slanders, and persecutions of the world: accuse and
terrify for sin secretly committed, which never did, nor shall come into the
knowledge of men: incite to holiness, and curb and bridle from Iniquity, which
is a manifest token, and proof, that there is a supreme judge, who has given
a law binding the conscience, does observe all our thoughts, devises, words,
and works, and will call us to an account, and reckoning.

4. The soul is a spiritual, invisible, and immortal substance, endued with
power to understand and will; but the soul and the powers thereof, is not of
and from it self; therefore it must proceed from another cause, which is
power, wisdom, and understanding it self, and that is God. 2. In the
understanding, there are certain principles whereby it diserneth truth and
falsehood, good and evil; this gift man has not of himself, therefore it
springs from a supreme and most wise understanding, the principal cause being
ever more excellent then the effect. 3. The mind is not satisfied with the
knowledge, nor the will with the possession of all things in this world, but
still they seek, and earnestly thirst after some higher good: there is
therefore a Sovereign truth, and chief good, which being perfectly known,
and enjoyed will give contentment. 4. By the power and faculties of the Soul,
man is capable of happiness, or of the chief good; but in vain should he be
made capable thereof, if there were not a chief good to be possessed and
enjoyed.

5. By the assaults and suggestions of Satan we feel there is a Devil, may we
not then certainly conclude that there is a God? 2. Satan labors by all means
to extinguish the light of the Gospel, to lead men on in ignorance, error, and
profaneness, and to turn them out of the path of holiness: Now why should
Satan war thus against God, his word, and Saints, why should he seek Gods
dishonor, and man's destruction, if there were not a God, a law and an
everlasting life.

Q. How else?
A. By the 6 consent of nations, 7 defense Psalm. 9. 16, and 58. 10. 11.
of the Church, 8 support and Ier. 33. 9.
comfort of the godly; but principally by the Es. 42. 8.
Scripture.

Expos. 6. All nations in every age, time, and place of the world, have
acknowledged that there was a God. 2. The Gentiles could not endure him who
denied a divine power. 3. They adored stocks, stones, brute beasts, and the
basest creatures, rather then they would have no dietie at all. 4. They were
zealous and forward in the worship of their Idols, which shows that though
they acknowledged not the true God, yet they knew there is a God to whom
divine worship is due. 5. Such as have studied to become Atheists, could never
blot this truth out of their consciences, but the majesty of God has
affrighted, and his terrors made them afraid.

7. The devil with great malice and fury, and ungodly men with all their
might, authority, malice, and policy, have labored to find out, and extirpate
all those that call upon the name of the Lord Jesus; but they have been
miracuously hid, preserved and defended by the Lord. 2. God has wonderfully
frustrated all the devises of the wicked enemies of his Church; by the means
they practiced to root it out, it was increased. 3. God. fought from heaven
against the persecutors of his children, and executed upon them the fiercenes
of his displeasure: dreadful judgments did overtake many of them, and such
horror fell upon some, that they were forced to leave their places of honor,
and rule, and betake themselves to a solitary and private life. 4. The Lord
has armed his children with invincible courage and fortitude, to endure
disgrace, contempt, poverty, death, and the most exquisite torments, that hell
could invent; he has supported them under the burden of an accusing
conscience, and inwardly ref^^shed them as it were suddenly with sweet peace
and consolation, and by the power, strength, and comfort of the holy Ghost,
has enabled them to sing Psalms in prison, and in the midst of the fire:
which courage, strength, and comfort of theirs, does plainly demonstrate that
there is a God; specially if you compare it with that fear, faintnes, and
unquietness, vexation, and deadnes, which is in other men when they suffer any
thing.

Q. What is God?
A. He is Ioh. 4. 24.
a 9 Spirit, having Luke 24. 39.
his being of 10 himself.

Expos. 9. God is a spiritual, invisible, and immateriall substance. 1. Tim.
1. 17. Luke 24. 39.

10. God is without beginning, Psalm. 90. 2. and 93. 2. Esa. 43. 1^. and 44. 6.
and without cause, Apoc. 1. 8. Esa. 41. 4. and 43. 10. and 48. 12. and so he
is without composition, infinite, Psa. 147. 5. and 145. 3. Exodus 3. 14.
eternal, Prou. 8. 22, 23. Romans 16. 26. incomprehensible, Exodus 33. 22. 23. 1.
Tim. 6. 16. 1. Kin. 8. 27. Esa. 66. 1. and unchangeable, Iam. 1. 17. Mal. 3. 6.

Q. How many Gods be there?
A. Only Deuteronomy. 6. 4. 1. Cor. 8. 4. 6.
one 11 God and 12 three Matthew. 28. 19. 1. Ioh. 5. 7.
Persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

Expos. 11. There can be but one Omnipotent, Dan. 4. 35. infinite, eternal,
most perfect first cause, and directer of all things; all things are referred
to one first, Romans 11. 35. Apocal. 1. 8. and 4. 11.

12. A person generally taken, is one entire substance, not common to many,
^ndued with life and understanding, will, and power. A person in the Godhead, is
the Godhead restrained, or distinguished by his personal property. Ioh. 14.
16. and 15. 1. The whole divine nature being indivisible, 1. Cor. 8. 6. is
common to all three persons, Farher, Son, and Holy Ghost. Act. 4. 24. 2. Cor.
1. 3. Ioh. 1. 1. Romans 9. 5. Heb. 1. 8. Numb. 12. 6. 7. with Act. 1. 16. 1. Pet.
1. 11. Heb. 1. 1. Act. 4. 25. with 2. Pet. 1. 21. and therefore whatsoever does
absolutely agree to the divine nature, or is spoken of the divine nature by
relation unto the creatures, that does agree likewise to every person in
Trinity. Ioh. 1. 1. Prou. 8. 22. Apoc. 1. 8. Matthew. 18. 20. Ioh. 3. 13. Job
26. 13. and 33. 4. Ioh. 14. 26. Luke 1. 35. Every person in Trinity, is
equal in glory and eternity. Ioh. 10. 30. Ioh. 17. 5. Phil. 2. 6. Ephesians. 1. 17.
with Ioh. 12. 41. and there is a most near communion and union between them,
by which each one is in the rest, and with the rest. Ioh. 14. 10. 11. Io. 1. 1.
and cuery one does possess, love, and glorify each other. Prou. 8. 22. 30. v.
Ioh. 17. 5. working the same things. Ioh. 5. 19. But the Godhead considered
with the personal property of begetting, is the Father, etc.

Q. What is the property of the Father?
A. To be of himself, and 1. Ioh. 1. 18. and 3. 18.
to 13 beget his Son.

Expos. 13. The divine nature does neither beget, nor is begotten: but the
Father does beget his Son by an eternal and necessary communication of his
essence, wholly and indiuisibly to his Son, which yet he wholly retains in
himself. Ioh. 1. 1. Pro. 8. 22, 23.

Q. What is the property of the Son?
A. To be Ioh. 3. 18.
begotten of the Father.

Q. What is the property of the Holy Ghost?
A. To proceed from the Ioh. 15. 26.
Father, and Romans 8. 9. Gal. 4. 6.
the Son.

Q. The nature of God is infinite and incomprehensible, how then may we
conceive of him?
A. By his Exodus 34. 6, 7.
properties 14, and by his Psa. 19. 1. and 8. 1. Job 36. 24. etc. and 37. 1. 18.
works.

Expos. 14. A property in God, is that whereby his divine nature is known in
it self, and distinguished from all other. The properties of God do not really
differ from the divine essence, nor one of them from the other; but only in
our manner of conceiving, wherefore every property in God is inseparable and
incommunicable.

Q. What are his properties?
A. He is 15 most Romans 16. 27.
wise, 16 Job 12. 13.
strong, Mat. 19. 17.
17 good, Exodus 33. 19. Romans 5. 8.
18 gracious, Psa. 145. 17.
19 just, Psalm. 103. 11. and 145. 8. 9.
20 merciful, Matthew. 5. 48. Job 35. 7, 8.
21 perfect, Mark. 14. 16. Romans 9. 5.
22 blessed, and 1. Cor. 2. 8.
23 glorious.

Expos. 15. Wisdom is that, whereby God by one, Heb, 4. 13. infinite, Ps.
139. 6. and 147. 5. Esa. 40. 28. eternal, Ephesians. 1. 4. simple, Exodus 3. 14. and
unchangeable act of his understanding, Esa. 46. 10. does know himself, Matthew.
11. 27. Ioh. 1. 18. and 7. 29. 1. Cor. 2. 10. 11. and all things, 1. Ioh. 3.
20. Ioh. 16. 20. and 21. 17. and actions clearly, infallibly, and distinctly,
1. Chr. 28. 9. 2. Tim. 2. 19. Psalm. 56. 8. and 147. 4. Matthew. 10. 30. with all
their circumstances, 1. Sam. 23. 11. 12. Matthew. 11. 21. Mat. 24. 22. Ioh. 7.
30. discerning a most wise reason of them. Ephesians. 1. 11. Pro. 8. 14.

16. Strength is that, whereby God does most freely, Psalm. 115. 3. and 135. 6.
without resistance or wearines, whatsoever he does will, Dan. 4. 35. Esa. 40.
28. and can do whatsoever he can will. Mat. 3. 9.

17. Goodness is that, whereby God being the chief good, Mark. 10. 18.
shows himself very good and bountiful to all his creatures, Psalm. 86. 5.
Genesis 1. 31. Psalm. 33. 5. and 36 6. and 145. 9.

18. Gratiousnesse is that, whereby God being truly amiable in himself,
Psalm. 86. 15. and 111. 5. is freely bountiful unto his creatures, Romans 3. 24.
loving and cherishing them tenderly, without any desert of theirs. Psalm. 145.
8. and 36. 5, 7, 9. Luke 1. 30.

19. Justice is that, whereby God is true in all his sayings, Eccl. 12. 10.
Romans 3. 4. and righteous in all his doings. Genesis 18. 25. Deuteronomy. 32. 4. Job. 8.
3. and 34. 10. and 36. 23. Psalm 9^. 15. Romans 9. 14. 2. Chron. 19. 7. Dan. 9. 14.

20. Mercy is that, whereby God of his free grace and love, is ready to succor
such as are, Psalm. 57. 10. and 108. 4. Psalm. 103. 4. and 145. 14. or might be
in misery by the condition of their nature.

21. Perfectnes is that, whereby God is necessarily all-sufficient in and of
himself. Genesis 17. 1. Job. 22. 2. and 35. 5, 6, 7. Ps. 16. 2. and the cause of
all perfection and goodness in every thing besides. Iam. 1. 17. 2. Cor. 3. 5.
and 4. 7. 1. Cor. 8. 4. 6. Romans 11. 36.

22. Blessedness is that, whereby God fully and essentially, knowing and willing
that perfection which is in himself, has all fullness of delight and
contentment, in and of himself, Genesis 17. 1. 1. Tim. 6. 15. and 1. 11. and is
the cause and object of the blessedness of his creatures. Psalm. 16. 11. and
17. 15. Ioh. 17. 3. 1. Ioh. 1. 3. 6.

23. Glory in God, is the admirable excellency of his most holy and divine
nature, whereby he infinitely excels all creatures. Exodus 33. 18. Psalm. 8. 1.
Ioh. 12. 41. Romans 1. 23. Psalm. 29. 9. This glory, the Lord does manifest more
obscurely in this life, Number. 12. 8. Exodus 33. 20. 1. Cor. 13. 12. by his
Gospel, 2. Cor. 4. 4. 6. and signs of his presence. Exodus 33. 22. Esa. 6. 1.
viz. some shining brightness, Luke 2. 9. Matthew. 17. 2. 5. or thick cloud and
darkness, Exodus 16. 10. and 24. 16. 1. Kin. 8. 11. and excellent acts
beseeming his greatness, Psalm. 19. 1. Psalm. 29. 9. Exodus 9. 16. Ioh. 2. 11. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 10. But more clearly it is revealed in heaven. Reu. 21. 23. Ioh. 17.

Q. What are his Works?
A. They are three, Decree, Creation, and Providence.

Q. What is the decree?
A. That whereby God has from eternity set down Ephesians. 1. 11.
with himself whatsoever 1 shall come to pass.

Expos. 1. All things with their causes, effects, circumstances, and manner of
being are decreed by God. Act. 2. 23. and 4. 27. 28. Ephesians. 1. 11. This decree is
most wise, Romans 11. 33. just, Romans 9. 13. 14. eternal, Ephesians. 1. 4. 5. 2. These.
2. 13. Act. 15. 18. 1. Cor. 2. 7. necessary, Psalm. 33. 11. Pro. 19. 21.
unchangeable, Heb. 6. 17. most free, Romans 9. 18. and cause of all good, Iam. 1.
17. but not of any sin, 1. Io. 1. 5. The special decree of God concerning
Angels and men is called predestination. Romans 8. 30. of the former little is
spoken in holy Scripture, of the latter more is revealed, not unprofitable to
be known. It may be defined, the wise, free, just, eternal, and unchangeable
sentence or decree of God. Ephesians. 1. 11. determining with himself, to create and
govern man for his special glory, viz. the praise of his glorious mercy, or
great justice, Romans 9. 17. 18. Romans 11. 36. Of this decree there be two parts:
Election and Reprobation. 1. These. 5. 9. Jude. 4. v. Election is the decreee of
God, of his free love, grace, and mercy, choosing some men to faith, holiness,
and eternal life, for the praise of his glorious mercy. 1. These. 1. 4. 2.
These. 2. 13. Ephesians. 1. 4. 5. 6. Romans 8. 29. 30. The cause which moved the Lord
to elect them who are chosen, was none other but his mere good will and
pleasure. Luke 12. 32. Romans 11. 5. and 9. 11. 16. Ephesians. 1. 5. 2. Tim. 1. 9. The
end, is the manifestation of the riches of his grace and mercy, Romans 9. 23.
Ephesians. 1. 2. The sending of Christ, faith, holiness, and eternal life are the
effects of Gods love, by which he manifests the infinite riches of his grace.
Io. 3. 16. 1. Io. 4. 10. Act. 13. 48. Tit. 1. 1. Col. 1. 12. Romans 6. 23. In the
same order, God does execute this decree in time, he did decree it in his
eternal counsel. 1. These. 5. 9. 2. These. 2. 13. Reprobation is the wise,
just, and absolute decree of God, ordaining to leave some men unto themselves,
to suffer them to fall, and to inflict upon them eternal punishment, deserved
by their sins, for the praise of his unspeakable and great justice. Romans 9. 11.
13. 22. Jude. 4. v. Ier. 6. 30. The cause of this decree is the absolute will
and good pleasure of God. Mat. 11. 26. Romans 9. 13. man's sin is the cause why
God will punish, but no occasion why he did ordain to pass by, or to punish
man, Romans 9. 18. 20. This decree is just, because God has power over man, as
the potter has over his clay, to make one vessel to honor, and another unto
dishonor. Romans 9. 21. Ier. 18. 6. Matthew. 20. 15. The end hereof is not the
condemnation of the creature, but the manifestation of Gods justice. Romans 9.
22. Sin is the effect of man's free will, and condemnation is an effect of
justice, inflicted upon man for sin and disobedience. Io. 3. 18. and 12. 37.
38. 39. 40. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. 10 but the decree of God which is good, is the
cause of neither. Ps. 5. 4. A man in this life may be assured of this election.
2. Pet. 1. 10. 1. These. 1. 4. and eternal happiness. Matthew. 24. 24. Io. 10. 28.
29. Romans 8. 33. 34. 2. Tim. 2. 19. but not of his reprobation, for he that is
now profane, may be called hereafter. Matthew. ^0. 5. 6.

Q. What is creation?
A. That whereby God made all Heb. 11. 3.
things 2 of nothing, in Exodus 20. 11.
six days.

Expos. 2. The first matter whereof all things were made was not eternal. Genesis
1. 1. Pro. 8. 22. 23. for then it could not be subject to alteration, Psalm.
102. 26. 27. neither should God be the fountain of all goodness, if any thing
had a being and not from him: then the word beginning could not be referred to
all things, But it was made simply of nothing in time. Heb. 11. 3. and other
corporal things were made of it. Genesis 1. 6. etc. by no less power and
wisdom then the lump it self. Ier. 10. 12. Reu. 4. 11. Ioh. 38. 4. 5. 6. 7.
etc.

Q. In what form or manner were all things created?
A. In an Ier. 10. 12. Genesis 1. 1. etc.
excellent order, and exceeding Genesis 1. 31.
good.

Q. For what end did God make all things?
A. For the Reu. 4. 11. Pro. 16. 4.
praise of his great power, goodness, wisdom, perfection, and freedom.

Q. What is providence?
A. That whereby God 3 does Psalm. 3. 8. Psalm. 36. 6. 1. Tim. 4. 10.
preserve, Pro. 15. 3. Matthew. 10. 29. 30. 31.
and 4 govern all things, with all their actions.

Expos. 3. God does conserve all creatures in their kind, Genesis 7. 1. 2. 3. and
9. 1. 2. 3. Act. 17. 25. 27. and in particular. Deuteronomy. 25. 4. 1. Cor. 9. 9. Job.
38. vl^. or 39. 3. Psalm. 147. 9. both in respect of their nature, and of their
qualities. Psalm. 19. 1, 2. Job. 39. 1. 2. etc. Exodus 23. 25. Deuteronomy. 28. 5.

4. God governs all creatures according to their several natures, Psa. 33.
13, 14, 15. and 135. 6, 7. and 104. 14. and 145. 15. Job 10. 8, 9, 10, 11.
Prou. 20. 24. Psa. 119. 91. with all their actions, Psalm. 14. 2. and 33. 13.
14. 18. Eccl. 3. 1, 2, 3. etc. and 8. 6. Genesis 20. 6. and 50. 19, 20. even those
things which are most casual in respect of us. Exodus 21. 13. Deuteronomy. 19. 5. God
in great wisdom and justice does suffer men to sin, Psalm. 50. 21. Act. 14.
16. with -- holding and withdrawing from them his grace, Psalm. 81. 11. 12.
Matthew. 11. 25. Luke 10. 21. trying them by outward occasions, Genesis 3. 5. 6. 2.
Sam. 11. 2. and 16. 20, 21, 22. Judge. 2. 20. 21. giving Satan liberty to tempt
them, 2. Sam. 24. 1. 2. Chr. 21. 1. Luke 22. 31. and carrying them forward,
when by their own fault they are out of the way, Act. 17. 18. Psalm. 105. 25.
Romans 1. 24. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9, 10, 11. Also he does limit sin, and determine
the sinful actions of men, 2. Kin. 19. 28. Genesis 37. 27. 28. Psalm. 124. 1, 2.
2. Sam. 17. 24. 1. Sam. 24. 6, 7. and 29. 6, 7. Job 1. 6. 12. Genesis 20. 6. both

20. Romans 1. 28. Exodus 7. 3. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. 10. 11. and order them to an
excellent end, Pro. 21. 1. Genesis 50. 20. 21. and 45. 7. Job. 1. 11. 12. 22. and
2. 10. Esa. 10. 7.

Q. What are the special creatures made, preserved, and governed by the Lord?
A. Angels Hebr. 2. 7. Col. 1. 16.
and 5 Men.

Expos. 5. Angels are finite, Heb. 1. 13. 14. Col. 1. 16. Mat. 4. 11. and 26.
53. Psa. 68. 17. complete and immortal Spirits, Matthew. 22. 30. Luke 20. 36.
Heb. 1. 7. Psa. 104. 4. made after the image of God, Job 2. 1. Psa. 8. 5. Luke
9. 26. Matthew. 25. 31. Heb. 2. 7. that they might praise his name, and execute
his commandment. Psalm. 103. 20. Esa. 6. 3. The Angels that abode in the
truth, are excellent, Io. 8. 44. Ephesians. 1. 20. and 3. 10. for their nature, Esa.
6. 2. Dan. 9. 21. 2. These. 1. 7. gifts, 2. Sam. 14. 17. Matthew. 6. 10. and 25.
31. Luke 15. 10. 1. Pet. 1. 12. 2. Kin. 19. 35. Esa. 6. 2. Matthew. 24. 39. 1.
Cor. 13. 1. offices, Dan 7. 10. Reu. 5. 11. and estate. Matthew. 18. 10. Angels
and men are special creatures in respect of their natures, gifts, Psa. 8. 5.
and end why they were created, Psa. 103. 20. Psa. 95. 6.

Q. What was the state of man by Creation?
A. Marvelous Eccl. 7. 29. or 31.
holy and 6 happy.

Expos. 6. The whole man was made conformable to the will of God, free from all
impuritie and sin, and endued with all perfect righteousness befitting such
a creature.

Q. Why say you that man was holy?
A. Because he was created after the Genesis ^. 26. Col. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 23. 24.
7 Image of God, in 8 knowledge, righteousness 9 and true holiness.

Expos. 7. The Image or similitude of God, (for these two are all one, Genesis 1.
26. with Genesis 5. 3. Iam. 3. 9. 1. Cor. 15. 49. Col. 3. 9.) is a lively
resemblance of God, one essence. Genesis 1. 27. Man does resemble God, not in
respect of his body, nor chiefly in respect of the immortal and spiritual
substance of the soul, endued with reason and will; but in respect of the
graces which God bestowed upon the soul, Ephesians. 4. 23. 24. Col. 3. 10. and yet
by reason of the union of the soul and body, the whole man is said to be made
in the image of God. Genes. 9. 6.

8. As God knows himself, Ioh. 8. 55. 1. Cor. 20. 10. and all things besides,
Ioh. 16. 30. so man did truly, distinctly, perfectly, and effectually know
God, Romans 1. 19. 20. his will, Romans 2. 15. and works, Genesis 2. 20. 23. and his
own happiness in God, and his own present estate, though he was ignorant of
the future.

9. As God wills himself as the chief good, Esa. 42. 8. and can will
nothing but what is good; so man's will was able to choose God, and all good
freely, readily, and orderly, and to do what was required. 1. Chron. 28. 9.
and 29. 9. His affections also were subject to the rule of perfect reason;
duly and with an holy moderation carried unto that which is good, respecting
God or man. Tit. ^. 5. 12. 1. Tim. 3. 2. Matthew. 22. 37, 38, 39. Deuteronomy. 6. 5.

Q. Wherein did man's happiness consist?
A. In the enjoying Genesis 1. 29.
of 10 sweet peace and communion with the Lord.

Expos. 10. God did love, favor, and accept of man; and man did behold,
rejoice, and rest in the Lord with full delight.

Q. What further privileges did man enjoy in this state of innocence?
A. He was placed in Genesis 2. 15.
paradise, had liberty to eat of Genesis 2. 16.
every tree in the garden, except the tree of 11 knowledge of good and evil,
and was made Genesis 2. 19. Psa. 8. 6.
ruler of all earthly creatures. z Genesis 2. 17.


Expos. 11. The event of man's eating, or forbearing that fruit, did give the
name to that tree. If he had obeyed, he should be happy, having experience of
good: if he did eat thereof, he by experience should know what good he lost
thereby, and what misery he brought on himself.

Q. Were these things bestowed upon man that he might live as he list?
A. No, but that he might 12 serve the Reu. 4. 11. Psalm. 95. 6.
Lord his Maker, who therefore gave man a law, binding him always to perfect
obedience, and a special commandment to try him. c Romans 2. 14.


Expos. 12. God the Creator of man, Psalm. 100. 3. and in that respect his
supreme, and absolute sovereign, having bestowed so great gifts, and maine
liberties upon man freely, might upon his own will and pleasure require at the
hands of man, what obedience soever he had, or would enable him to perform.
Deuteronomy. 11. 31. 32. Ier. 27. 5. and might also inioyne him to manifest his
loa^tie and humility, by abstaining from some act in it self indifferent, for
no other reason but because he was so commanded. Dan. 4. 32. 35. Psa. 115. 3.

Q. What was that special commandment?
A. Of the tree of Genesis 2. 17.
knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat, for in the day that thou
eatest thereof, thou shall die the death.

Q. Death we hear was threatened if he did disobey; what promise was made to
encourage him to this duty?
A. The continuance Genesis 2. 9.
both of 13 himself and his 14 posterity in that good estate.

Expos. 13. The tree of life seems to be a sign, and seal of the continuance
of his happiness, if he had obeyed. Genesis 3. 22, 23, 24. Pro. 3. 18. Apoc. 2. 7.

14. All mankind was created good in Adam, Eccl. 7. 31. Romans 5. 12. 1. Cor. 15.
22. as other creatures were in their kind, Genesis 1. 31. and God did enter into
covenant with our first parents, Genesis 2. 17. as they were the root of all
their posterity: so that what they had actually promised to them, we had
promised to us also in them.

Q. Did man continue in that good estate?
A. No, but 15 he 1. Tim. 2. 14.
fell from God thorough the enticements of Satan.

Expos. 15. Man was created good, but mutable, so that he might fall, Genesis 2.
17. Eccl. 7. 31. and God not being bound to uphold him, Romans 11. 35. Genesis 17.
1. did suffer him to fall, knowing how to order the same for the setting forth
of his glory, Prou. 16. 4. God knew before that ^^an would transgress, Act.
15. 18. Psalm. 139. 2. yet was he not therefore to forbear to give man a most
wise, just, and easy precept, whereby he would show forth his Sovereignty
over man, 1. Sam. 15. 2. 9.

Q. How did he fall?
A. By sinning Eccl. 7. 29. or 31. Romans 5. 12. 1. Ioh. 3.
wilfully 16 against God, taansgressing his law.

Expos. 16. Satan was the principal outward cause of the sin of man, Genesis
3. 1. Ioh. 8. 44. Apoc. 12. 9. who envying the glory of God, and the salvation
of man, did use the serpent as his instrument to seduce the woman, Genesis 3. 1.
2. Cor. 11. 3. and the help of the woman to seduce the man, Genesis 3. 6. The
quality of the fruit, by accident was a cause to move them to eat thereof,
Genesis 3. 6. and the just and good law of God, forbidding that sin, may be said
to be an occasion of the sin, as it did forbid an act in it self
indifferent, that man could not commit it without sin; but the principal
inward cause of man's fall, was his own free will, freely and voluntarily
transgressing Gods commandment, which he might and ought to have obeyed, but
would not, Genesis 2. 7. 17. and 3. 23. 24. Romans 5. 19. Eccl. 7. 31.

Q. What was the sin he did commit?
A. The Genesis 3. 6.
eating of 17 the forbidden fruit.

Expos 17. The tree of knowledge in it self was good, Genesis 11, 12. 1. Tim. 4.
4. Genesis 3. 6. but the fruit thereof unlawful to be eaten, because God had
forbidden it to be eaten, 1. Ioh. 3. 4. Genesis 2. 17. And this sin of Adam was
exceeding great, because it was the breach of so easy a commandment, Genesis 1.
29. with Genesis 2. 17. that God had given for the the trial of his obedience,
committed by him that had received great favors from God, Genesis 1. 26, 27, 28,
etc. and that in Paradise, Genesis 3. 6. 23. Also it was accompanied with an heap
of other sins, infidelie, idolatry, unthankfulness to God, and contempt of
him, blasphemy in subscribing to the devil, murder, etc.

Q. Did all mankind sin in Adam?
A. Yes i, for 1^ we were all in his loins, 1. Romans 5. 12. 1. Cor. 15. 22.
Heb. 7. 9, 10.


Expos. 18. Adam was not a private person, but the common parent of us all; and
as he received integ^itie, for himself and us so he lost it for himself and
us.

Q. What is the state of all men hy reason of Adams fall?
A. They are Ephesians. 2. 1. 2.
dead 19 in Sin, and bondslaues 20 of Satan.

Expos. 19. To be dead in sin, is to be utterly deprived of all life of
grace. Ephesians. 5. 18. so that we can move to nothing of our selves, that is truly
acceptable in the sight of God.

20. To be Bondslaues of Satan, is to be under the power and dominion of the
devil, so that we do, and cannot but do his will and command. 1. Tim. 2.
25. 26 Act. 26. 18. 2. Cor. 4. 4.

Q. How does that appear?
A. In that they are altogether 2. Cor. 3. 5.
unable to good, and 21 prone Genesis 8. 21.
to evil continually.

Expos. 21. Every faculty of soul, and member of body is defiled with sin. 1.
These. 5. 53. Romans 5. 6. The mind is blind, Ier. 10. 14. and 51. 17. Matthew. 15.
14. Ephesians. 5. 8. impotent, Luke 24. 25. Io. 1. 5. and 3. 9. 10. and 8. 43. 1.

20. foolish, Pro. 22. 15. Tit. 3. 3. Es. 29. 13. Job. 11. 12. apt to devise
evil. Ier. 4. 22. The memory is feeble, apt to forget good, Luke 24. 6. 7. 8.
remember evil, but neither good, nor evil as it ought. Matthew. 27. 63. with

and superstitious, Mar. 10. 19. 20. Luke 18. 12. Matthew. 5. 2. 3. Io. 16. 2. or
doubting, Romans 14. 23. The will unable to choose good, 1. Cor. 2. 14. Phi. 2.
13. Matthew. 6. 10. 2. Tim. 2. 26. Romans 8. 8. strong to evil, yea altogether
auerse and rebellious. Matthew. 23. 37. Romans 6. 19. Ier. 18. 12. and 44. 16. 17.
The affections unruly and disordered, Gal. 5. 24. Romans 10. 2. 1. King. 22. 8.
and 21. 4. Iam. 4. 1. 2. 5. The members of the body, are tools to execute
sin conceived, Romans 6. 13. 19. and 3. 13. Psalm. 52. 4. 2. Pet. 2. 14. and
instruments to stir up sin in the soul, Genesis 3. 6. and 6. 2. 2. Sam. 11.
2. 1. King. 21. 1. 2. Matthew. 5. 28. 29. This pronesse to sin is ever present,
Ier. 7. 9. Genesis 6. 5. even then when the operations cease. And though a man
find himself less apt to one sin, then to another, being restrained or
renewed by the Spirit, Genesis 20. 6. Ier. 32. 40. Ephesians. 3. 16. or by reason of some
other defects, or lets, 2. King. 1. 12. and 19. 35. 1. King 13. 4. Hos. 2. 7.

39. 8. 9. Luke 4. 30. Io. 8. 59. yet corruption causes an aptitude, to every
sin, if it be not hindered.

Q. What fruits do proceed from this Original corruption?
A. Evil 22 thoughts Genesis 6. 5. Col. 1. 21.
, words, Gal. 5. 19.
and works,

Expos. 22. The thoughts and desires naturally are ignorant, erroneous,
unbelieving, deceitful, unruly, loose, wilful, vain, idle, blockish, not
sauouring good, proud, disdainful, uncharitable, silthy, etc. and in a word,
abominable, odious. The words and works, answearable to these. Psalm. 94. 7.

Q. Are all the actions of natural men evil continually?
A. Yea: 23 for they Math. 12. 35.
fail in many things, and as they come from them they are Pro. 28. 9.
odious unto God.

Expos. 23. A man by nature may do an act, that is good for the substance
thereof, Dan. 4. 27. or 24. Romans 2. 15. but never that which is truly and
spiritually good* Matthew. 7. 18. Ier. 13. 23. Romans ^. 10. Prou. 15. 8. and 21.
27. for his person is not accepted, Genesis 4. 4. 1. Pet. 2. 5. nor sanctified,
and so the good acts he does, proceeds not from a good root, viz. faith, and
the spirit of sanctification, 2. Tim. 1. 5. neither is it done in a right
manner, Iam. 4. 3. nor to a lawful end, viz. the glory of God, 1. Cor. 10.
31. Col. 3. 17. all which are required to the being of a good act.

Q. What punishments are due unto man by reason of these sins?
A. All woe Lam. 3. 39. Romans 6. 23. Gal. 3. 10.
and 24 misery, temporal spiritual, and eternal.

Expos. 24. The least sin, is a very vile breach of Gods most holy law, 1.
Io. 3. 4. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. and so an heinous offense against his infinite
majesty, Psalm. 51. 4. also of it own nature it is always joined with
impenitencie, Act. 5. 31. and 17. 30. and therefore does deserve death, with
all miseries accompanying the same.

Q. Which are the temporal miseries?
A. Gods curse upon the Romans 8. 20.
creatures, on Deuteronomy. 28. 25. 16. etc.
man's body, senses, name, friends, whatsoever he takes in hand, and Romans 6. 21.
death it self,

Q. What are the spiritual miseries?
A. 2^ Blindness Es. 6. 9.
of mind, the Romans 11. 8.
spirit of slumber and giddines, Matthew. 27. 3. 4. 5.
horror of conscience, Ex. 7. 3.
hardness of heart, a reprobate Rom 1. 28.
sense, and strong delusions, b 2. These. 2. 11.


Expos. 25. To be blind in mind, is to be utterly destitute of the true
knowledge of God, and of the life to come, and to be hastening to endless woes,
and yet not understanding it.

26. The Spirit of slumber, is that which through a vain persuasion of a man's
good and safe estate, l^lleth him a sleep in security. Deuteronomy. 29. 19.

27. Horror of conscience, is when the conscience awakened fills the soul
with deep doubts, hellish and unrecoverable desperation, and remediles fears
of everlasting damnation. Reu. 6. 16. 17.

28. Hardness of heart, is a fearful judgment of God, whereby the heart is
past all feeling and remorse, shut fast up that neither the word, nor works of
God can kindly work upon it. Es. 48. 4. Zach. 7. 11. 12.

29. A reprob^te sense or mind, is a mind destitute of judgment, and void
of common reason, taking evil for good, and good for evil, neither fearing
God, or reuerencing Man, regarding neither right nor wrong, Luke 18. 4.

30. Strong delusions, are when men are given over to take pleasure in
believing lies, and idle fancies of vain heads. To these we may add frenzy,
madness, Deuteronomy. 28. 28. to be given* over to vile affections, God with drawing
from men his grace, and in his secret but just and dreadful judgment, giving
them over to most sordide, and loathsome, unnatural, and inordinate lusts,
Psalm. 81. 12. Genesis 19. 5.

Q. Which is the eternal misery?
A. 31 Everlasting Romans 6. 23.
damnation,

Expos. 31. Damnation, which is an everlasting separation of soul and body,
from the comfortable presence of God, Matthew. 7. 23. Re^. 22. 15. and an
enduring of easlesse, endless, remediles torture with the devil and his Angels,
Mat. 25. 41. Reu. 20. 15. Luke 16. 24. 25. in the due desert of sin.

Q. After a man does know his misery, what must he learn in the next place?
A. The true means 1 how he Act. 2. 37.
may escape the foresaid misery, and be Act. 16. 30.
restored to hapines,

Expos. 1. God in justice passed by the Angels who fell without the enticement
of any other, 2. Pet. 2. 4. Jude. 6. Matthew. 25. 41. but of his infinite love,
free grace and mercy, Es. 43. 25. Ier. 31. 3. Hos. 14. 4. Io. 3. 16. Romans 5. 8,
9. Ephesians. 1. 5, 6. 1. Io. 5. 19. he has prescribed means, whereby man might
escape misery, and be restored to happiness, Act. 2. 37, 38, 39, 40.

Q. By what means may we escape this misery, and recover happiness?
A. Onley 2 by Act 4. 12.
Jesus Christ,

Expos. 2. God in justice does hate sin, Es. 1. 3. Psalm. 45. 7. and has
denounced death against the transgressers of his law* Genesis 2. 17. Deuteronomy. 27.
26. Es. 30. 33. Ier. 4. 4. therefore to satisfy his justice, Col. 1. 20. and
make way for mercy, Psalm. 14^. 9. his infinite wisdom found out a means,
Genesis 3, 15. even by Jesus Christ, upon whom the Father laid this office of
reconciliation, Psalm. 40. 6, 7. Heb. 5. 5. Io. 3. 17. and 5. 36, 37. which he
willingly undertook, Heb. 10. 7. 9. and did faithfully discharge. Heb. 10. 5,
6, 7.

Q. What is Jesus Christ?
A. The ^ eternal Son of God, who in time became man for his elect. g Gal.
4. 4, 5.


Expos. 3. The Son of God by nature became the Son of Man, that he might
make us the Sons of God by adoption. who were by nature the children of
wrath, Ephesians. 2. 3. it being fit that our reconciliation should be wrought by
the Son, Esa. 61. 1. Ioh. 1. 4. Ioh. 5. 36. 37. Col. 1. 16, 17. Heb. 1. 3.
Ioh. 5. 17. and 3. 17. and sealed by the holy Ghost, Ephesians. 1. 13. and 4. 30.

Q. How many things are we to consider in Christ?
A. His Col. 2. 9.
person and his Heb. 2. 16, 17.
office.

Q. What is his person?
A. It is Ioh. 1. 14. Es. 7. 14. Romans 9. 5.
God and man 4 united together into 1. Cor. 8. 6.
one person.

Expos. 4. In Christ there are two distinct natures, Heb. 1. 14, 15. Matthew. 18.
20. with 1. Tim. 2. 5. Luke 1. 35. Mat. 18. 20. Reu. 1. 8. Heb. 1. 11, 12. Ioh.
16. 30. Phil. 2. 6. Ioh. 1. 3. and 5. 17. Matthew. 8. 13. with Luke 22. 43.
Matthew. 24. 36. and 27. 4. 6. Ioh. 4. 6. and 11. 35. and 14. 28. Ephesians. 4. 10.
inseparably united, 1. Pet. 3. 18. Ioh. 10. 18. Heb. 9. 14. not confounded,
Romans 1. 3, 4. and 9. 5. Ioh. 16. 30. with Luke 2. 52. Mar. 13. 32. and yet
there is but one Christ, not many Christ's, 1. Cor. 8. 6. 1. Tim. 2. 5. for the
Godhead did assume the humane nature to it self, Phil. 2. 7. heb. 2. 16. so
that the Manhood subsisteth in the Godhead, Matthew. 3. 17. and 17. 5. and they
are so inseparably united, that the self same person which is God, is also
man, Ioh. 3. 13. Ephesians. 4. 10.

Q. Being God before all time, how could he be made man?
A. He was Luke 1. 35.
conceived 5 by the holy Ghost, borne of the virgin Marie, according Genesis 3.
15. Esa. 7. 14. and 11. 1.
to the Prophets.

Expos. 5. Christ's conception is the miraculous and supernatural forming of
his humane nature in the womb of the Virgin Marie, Esa. 7. 14. Genesis 49. 10.
Luke 1. 35. by the power of the holy Ghost, Mat. 1. 18. 20. who did perfectly
sanctify it in the very first moment of conception, Luke 1. 35.

Q. Why was Christ conceived by the holy Ghost?
A. That he might be Luke 1. 35.
pure without sin, wherewith all are Ioh. 3. 6.
stained who are conceived after the ordinary manner.

Q. Why was he God?
A. That he might bear the weight of Gods wrath without sinking under it,
overcome death, be the Head 6 of the Church, repair his Image in us, conquer
the enemies of our salvation, and defend us against them.

Expos. 6. The dignity of being Head of the Church is so great, that it cannot
agree to any mere man, Ephesians. 1. 21. Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11. Heb. 1. 6. also the
offices of the head, are to give the power of life, feeling, and moving, to
the body, Ioh. 1. 4. Romans 8. 2. and to direct by his power, the inward and
outward functions of the body, Ephesians. 5. 23, 24. which benefits he that is man
only cannot bestow upon the Church.

Q. Why was he man?
A. That he might 7 suffer Heb. 2. 14.
death for us, sanctify Heb. 2. 11.
our 8 nature, and we might have Heb. 4. 15, 16.
access with boldness to the throne of grace.

Expos. 7. The Divine nature could not suffer, I am. 1. 17. Mal. 3. 6. Romans 9.
5. and without shedding of blood there could be no remission of sins, Heb. 9.
22. Christ therefore took our nature that he might suffer death, Phil. 2. 7.
specially it being no ways meet, that one having no special communion with
another, should endure punishment for another fault, Heb. 2. 16, 17.

8. Fullness of all graces above measure, were powered into the humane nature of
Christ our Savior, Matthew. 3. 16. Ioh. 1. 16. and 3. 34. Col. 2. 9. and 1. 19.
and we being united to him, and having communion with him, do receive in
measure of his fulness, Ephesians. 4. 7. 16.

Q. What is his office?
A. To be 1. Tim. 2. 5.
Mediator 9 to reconcile God and man.

Expos. 9. A Mediator, or an Advocate, is a third person that takes upon him to
agree and reconcile two that be at variance, as Christ being both God and man,
did set at one God and man, Ephesians. 1. 10. Col. 1. 20. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. who before
were separated by sin, Esa. 59. 2. Ier. 5. 25. Christ is our Mediator both as
God and man, Ioh. 1. 29. 34. and 3. 14. 16. Romans 5. 8. 1. Ioh. 1. 7. Phil. 2.
6. for in the work of our redemption he performed many divine works, Heb. 2.
14. Ioh. 10. 18. as Mediator, he is the King and Head of his Church, Luke 1.
33. Ioh. 3. 35. Act. 2. 36. Phil. 2. 9, 10, 11. Matthew. 28. 18. Heb. 1. 6. and
2. 7. and the special offices of Christ our Mediator, do necessarily
require, that the divine and humane nature jointly do concur in the
execution of them, Ioh. 1. 18. Matthew. 11. 27. Ioh. 3. 12, 13. 2. Cor. 5. 18,
19, 20. Romans 5. 10, 11. Heb. 9. 14. and 7. 25. This office is peculiar to
Christ, Ioh. 14. 6. 1. Tim. 2. 5, 6. Heb. 7. 24. and neither in whole nor part
can be transferred to any other, Act. 4. 10, 11, 12. Heb. 4. 14. Ioh. 11. 42.
1. Ioh. 2. 1. Heb. 7. 25. Ephesians. 3. 12. Heb. 2. 14, 15. Act. 10. 42, 43. and 17.
31. In the decree of God Christ was a Mediator from eternity, Ephesians. 1. 5, 6.
In the virtue and efficacy of his mediation, he was given to be Mediator
as soon as necessity required, Reu. 13. 8. Genesis 3. 15. In the fullness of time
he was manifested in the flesh, Gal. 4. 4. 5.

Q. How did he that?
A. By his Matthew. 3. 15.
fulfilling 10 the law, and by his 11 Heb. 9. 15. Romans 5. 12, 13.
sufferings.

Expos. 10. It became him who was our faithful high Priest to fulfill all
righteousness.

11. The justice of God must be satisfied, and the debt of sin must be paid,
before God who is true, just, and unchangeable, could be pleased with us, 1.
Ioh. 2. 2. Heb. 9. 14, 15. 1. Pet. 1. 18, 19. Reu. 1. 5.

Q. What understand you by his sufferings?
A. His voluntary Phil. 2. 5. 6, 7, 8.
humiliation both in Esa. 53. 10. Matthew. 26. 38. Heb. 9. 14.
12 soul and body, his Luke 23. 33.
crucifying, 1. Cor. 15. 3, 4.
13 death, burial, and Act. 2. 27.
abiding 13 under the dominion of death for a time.

Expos. 12. Christ in his incarnation did assume our whole nature, Luke 2. 40.
52. Heb. 2. 6. Luke 23. 46. 1. Tim. 2. 5. Luke 19. 10. Matthew. 26. 38. Mark. 14.
34. Mat. 27. 16. Ioh. 19. 30. Heb. 10. 5. Matthew. 26. 12. Heb. 2. 17. that by
offering it up a sacrifice for sin, he might redeem us, Heb. 8. 1, 2, 3.
Heb. 9. 14. and 13. 10, 11, 12. In our nature he became our surety, Job 19.
25. Heb. 7. 22. therefore he suffered properly in soul as well as in body,
Matthew. 27. 46. Gal. 3. 13. Heb. 2. 9. 10. 14. which is set forth in the Lords
Supper, 1. Cor. 11. 25. and was signified by the sacrifices in the law, Hebr.
9. 19, 20, 21. 22.

13. The death of Christ was the separation of his soul and body, Matthew. 27.
50. Luke 23. 46. though they both continued still united to the Godhead, Mat.
1. 23. Ioh. 1. 14. 1. Pet. 3. 18. 1. Cor. 2. 8. It was necessary that Christ
should die, that he might satisfy Gods justice, Heb. 9. 22. abolish and kill
sin, Mat. 26. 28. Romans 5. 10. Romans 8. 3. Romans 6. 10, 11. 1. Ioh. 3. 8.
destroy death, and him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, Heb.
2. 14. 2. Tim. 1. 10. Ioh. 12. 31. Hos. 13. 14. deliver us from the fear of
both, Heb. 2. 14. Luke 1. 74. confirm the Testament or covenant of grace,
which he made with us, Heb. 9. 16, 17. and 13. 20. Zach. 9. 11. and obtain
for us the spirit of grace, Act. 2. 33. Gal. 3. 14. and 4. 4, 5. Betwixt the
death and sufferings of Christ and of the Martyrs, we may observe these
differences: 1. Christ his passion was an accursed punishment, Gal. 3. 13. the
sufferings of the Martyrs and holy men, are only chastisements or trials. 2.
Christ's passion was a meritorious sacrifice, Heb. 9. 14. the passions of the
Martyrs are of no value to merit any thing, Romans 8. 18. 3. As the sins of the
elect were laid upon Christ, Leu. 16. 21. Esa. 53. 11. Heb. 9. 28. so was the
punishment of their sin for substance and kind, though not for circumstance
of place or continuance, Heb. 4. 15. and therefore he suffered both in soul
and body the wrath of God which was due unto us for sin, though he suffered
not every particular punishment of sin, which every particular sinner
meets withal, Rom 5. 19. Heb. 10. 14. But the Martyrs were not forsaken,
though they were not delivered out of the hands of the persecutors. 4. Christ
was in himself pure and innocent, but he suffered for our sins, 2. Cor. 5.
21. the Martyrs were not free from sin, neither did they suffer for the
expiation of sin.

14. Until the third day death had power and dominion over Christ, for so long
death kept a sunder soul and body, Luke 24. 7. Matthew. 17. 23. Act. 10. 40.

Q. Did Christ always abide under the power and dominion of death?
A. No, for the power of death being Act. 2. 31.
subdued, the third 1. Cor. 15. 4.
day he 14 rose again, Mark. 16. 19.
ascended into heaven, and sits 15 at the right hand of the Father.

Expos. 14. The resurrection of Christ is the first degree of his exaltation,
wherein his soul being joined to the same flesh that died, he was raised up to
life, 1. Cor. 15. 4. It was necessary that he should rise again, in regard of
the excellency of his person, Act. 2. 24. the covenant which he had made with
the Father, Psa. 2. 6, 7. Es. 53. 10. the dignity of his high office of
eternal mediation, Psalm. 110. 6, 7. Romans 4. 25. and that the truth of those
things which were foretold concerning the glory of the Messiah, might be
fulfilled. Christ by his divine power rose again from the dead, Romans 1. 4. 1.
Pet. 3. 18. 1. Tim. 3. 16. Io. 5. 21. and 10. 17, 18. Act. 2. 24. and 3. 15.
Ephesians. 1. 17. 20. Romans 8. 11. not as a private but as a public person, Romans 5.
14. 19. 1. Cor. 15. 45. Heb. 10. 14. 1. Pet. 2. 20, 21. thereby showing that
his satisfaction is fully absolute, Rom 4. 25. and 6. 9, 10. The end of his
resurrection was, that he might prepare himself to the performance of the
glorious functions of a Mediator, and show himself to be the conqueror of
death, and the Lord of quick and dead, Romans 14. 9. Act. 17. 31.

15. To sit at the right hand, is a manner of speech borrowed from earthly
Princes, who use to set at their right hand such as they substitute to rule
under them in their names, 1. King. 2. 19. And hereby is clearly noted that
excellent glory, power, and dominion of Christ, received of the Father, whereby
he does execute his Kingly, Priestly, and Prophetical office in glory, Matthew.
28. 18. Io. 17. 2. Phi. 2. 9, 10. Psa. 110. 1.

Q. What are the special parts of Christ's Mediatorship?
A. He 16 is a Act. 3. 22.
Prophet, Heb. 2. 17.
Priest, and Psalm. 110. 1.
King,

Expos. 16. In the time of the law, Prophets, Priests, and Kings were anointed,
1. Reg. 19. 16. Exo. 28. 41. 1. Sam. 16. 13. who were types of Christ, truly
anointed our Prophet, Priest and King. Also our Mediator was to obtain and
purchase for us full redemption, and to bestow upon us righteousness and
eternal life obtained, and to show unto us the way of salvation, which do
necessarily require this threefold office of Christ.

Q. Why was Christ a Prophet?
A. To Luke 4. 18, 19.
reveal 17 unto us the way to everlasting life,

Expos. 17. Before his coming in the flesh, our Savior Christ made known the
will of God to the Patriarks and Prophets, either immediately, 2. Pet. 1. 21. 2.
Sam. 23. 2. Genesis 3. 9. 10, 11. or by the ministry of Angels, Genesis 31. 11.
Judge. 6. 12. 2. Kin. 1. 3. and by the patriarks and Prophets, he informed the
Church of the Old Testament in all points necessary to salvation, 2. Pet. 2.
5. 1. Pet. 3. 19. Jude. 14. Luke 1. 70. Ephesians. 2. 30. 1. Pet. 1. 11. In the
fullness of time taking upon him our nature, being after a most excellent
manner sanctified by the Spirit, Luke 1. 35. Dan. 9. 24. furnished with all
gifts necessary, Matthew. 3. 16, 17. Io. 3. 34. Psalm. 45. 8. Es. 11. 2. Io. 1.
18. and 3. 32. and called of the Father to this office Luke 3. 21, 22. Matthew.
3. 16. 17. Matthew. 17. 5. he did in his own person preach unto the Jews about
the space of three years and a half, Act. 1. 1. Luke 21. 37. Heb. 1. 1. Dan.
9. 27. not altogether passing by the Samaritans and Caananits, Io. 4. 40.
Matthew. 15. 22. With admirable wisdom, Mar. 6. 2. Matthew. 21. 23. 27. and 22.
46. ardent zeal, Io. 2. 14. 17. Io. 4. 34. excellent grace, Psalm. 45. 2, 3.
Matthew. 7. 29. Luke 4. 22. and 11. 27. singular meekenes, Matthew. 11. 29. and
authority unusual, Matthew. 7. 29. Matthew. 5. 21, 22. not respecting any man's
person, Matthew. 21. 42. 43. Mar. 12. 14. he interpreted the law, Matthew. 5. 21.
22. etc. and 19. 4. 5. reproved the corruptions of the Scribes and Pharisees,
Io. 2. 16. Matthew. 23. 13. foretold some things that were to come, Matthew. 16.
21. Luke 19. 43. 44. Matthew. 24. 3. etc. and taught the Gospel, or the last will
of God concerning the salvation of Man, Esa. 61. 1. 2. Luke 4. 18. illustrating
his doctrine for the most part, by parables and similitudes, as the people were
able to bear it, Matthew. 13. 3. Mar. 4. 33. and confirming that which he
taught, by the Scriptures of the old Testament, Io. 5. 46. Matthew. 22. 32. Luke
24. 26. 27. 44. 45. and holiness of life exactly answearing to his doctrine,
with diverse signs of all kinds, Io. 3. 2. and 5. 36. Io. 6. 61, 62, and 2.
25. Matthew. 9. 4. Io. 9. 6. and 11. 43, 44. and that most cruel and bitter
death which for the truth of God he did voluntarily undergo. 1. Tim. 6. 13.
After his ascension our Savior taught his Church by his Apostles and
Ministers, Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. Act. 10. 41, 42. The Apostles being fully and
perfectly instructed by Christ himself in those things which concern the
Kingdom of God, Act. 1. 3. Ioh. 15. 15. and 17. 8. and extraordinarily
furnished with gifts, and infallibly assisted by the Spirit; Act. 2. 3, 4. Io.
14. 26. and 16. 13. were sent forth to preach the whole counsel of God, so
far as concerns man and the means of his salvation, Act. 20. 27. Matthew. 28.
20. 1. Cor. 2. 9, 10, 11. 1. Io. 1. 3. Romans 1. 16. unto all nations, Matthew. 28.
18. 19. Mar. 16. 15. Their doctrine they confirmed both by the Prophets of the
old testament, Act. 26. 22. and 28. 23. 2. Pet. 1. 18. 19. and by diverse
signs and wonders which God wrought by them, Heb. 2. 3, 4. Mar. 16. 20. In the
days also, and since the death of the Apostles, our Savior does execute his
prophetical office by his ordinary Ministers, whom he has commanded us to
hear, so long as they preach according to the Scriptures, Ephesians. 4. 11. 12. Luke
10. 16. so that Christ is the Author of the doctrine which he taught, Ministers
are the Instruments of Christ, to teach not their own, but his doctrine, 2.
Cor. 5. 20. Job. 33. 23. The fruit of this office is the restoring of
knowledge decayed in the first fall of man, and the manifestation of divine
mysteries unknown to the world, Romans 16. 25. 26. Ephesians. 3. 9. Col. 1. 26. 27.

Q. Why was Christ a 18 Priest?
A. To Heb. 5. 9.
purchase for us righteousness and life eternal,

Expos. 18. Christ is our high Priest, not after the order of Aaron, but after
the order of Melchisedec, Psalm. 110. 4. Aaron was of the tribe of Leui, Heb. 7.
5. his stock and lineage was known, Ex. 6. 16. 18. 20. he was compassed with
infirmities, mortal, a sinner, and had need to offer for himself, and for his
own sins, Heb. 7. 28. and 5. 2, 3. 4. and 9. 7. but Christ was of the tribe
of Judah. Heb. 7. 14. without Father touching his humanity, without mother
touching his dietie, Heb, 7. 3. immortal and continuing for ever, holy,
harmeles, undefiled, who had no need to offer for himself, but offered
himself for the people only, Heb. 7. 25. 26, 27. Material oil was powered
upon Aaron at his consecration; Leu. 8. 12. but Christ was anointed with the
holy Ghost, Act. 10. 38. Aaron was instituted without an oath, but Christ with
an oath. Heb. 7. 20. 21. 28. Psalm. 110. 4. The Priesthood of Aaron was
typical, Heb. 10. 2, 3. not auailable to take away sin, Heb. 9. 14. 15. but
the Priesthood of Christ is true and real, containing the very Image and body
of things themselves; perfect to abolish sin, and to obtain eternal
redemption, Heb. 10. 1. 5. 11. Heb. 9. 12. 14. The Leuiticall Priesthood was
to be abrogated, Heb. 8. 13. but Christ's Priesthood is to continue for ever;
Heb. 7. 24. Aaron died and had successors, Heb. 7. 23. but Christ succeeded
none, has no successors, but is our only and unchangeable high Priest for
ever, Heb. 7. 3. Aaron and his successors, offered the bodies, and the blood of
beasts, Heb. 9. 12. 14. but Christ himself is both the Priest and sacrifice,
Ephesians. 5. 25. Heb. 9. 26. and 10. 10. They offered oftentimes one manner of
sacrifice, but Christ has offered himself once for all. Heb. 7. 27. and 9.
25. 26. and 10. 12. 14. 1. Pet. 3. 18. Aaron and his successors entered into the
Tabernacle made with hands, Heb. 8. 5. and 9. 6. but Christ is entered into the
very heavens, Heb. 9. 11. 24. and 4. 14. Aaron and his suceessors were Priests
only, but Christ is both King and Priest, Heb. 7. 1, 2. Aaron and his
successors were but Ministers, but Christ is the author of salvation, Heb. 5.
9. all which do show the absoluteness, perfection, and excellency of Christ
his Priesthood.

Q. What are the functions of his Priestly office?
A. Offering 19 up Heb. 5. 1. and 9. 26. and 7. 25.
himself a sacrifice once for all, and 20 making request for us,

Expos. 19. Christ thorough the eternal Spirit, Heb. 9. 14. offered up his
soul and body as a sweet smelling sacrifice to the Father, Ephesians. 5. 2. once
for all, Heb. 10. 12. whereby he was consecrated, and did enter into heaven,
presenting himself before the Father for us, Heb. 9. 24. and 10. 20.

20. Christ^ intercession is his most gracious will, fervently and vnmooueably
desiring, that all his members for the perpetual virtue of his sacrifice, may
be accepted of the Father, Romans 8. 34. This is both universal and particular,
heavenly and glorious, ever effectual, no way reciprocal, and tendered only
for the virtue of his sacrifice.

Q. Why was Christ a 20 King?
A. To 21 bridle Psalm. 110. 1. Col. 2. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 28. 1. Ioh. 10. 16. Hag.
2. 7.
and subdue all his enemies, but i to 22 gather, and Ezekiel. 34. 23, 24.
govern 23 his elect and chosen.

Expos. 20. The Kingly office of Christ is his spiritual, eternal, and
absolute dominion, Luke 17. 20. Ioh. 18. 36. Dan. 2. 44. and 7. 14. Heb. 1. 8.
Reu. 3. 7. whereby being appointed of the Father, Psalm. 2. 6, 7. and 45. 7.
Psalm. 110. 2. Matthew. 11. 27. Act. 2. 33. Lord of all things in heaven and
earth, Heb. 2. 7, 8. and peculiarly King and Head of his Church, Ephesians. 1. 21,
22. he does confound and destroy all his enemies, but does gather and goue^n
his elect, Hos. 1. 7. Esa. 33. 22. by his word and spirit, for their salvation
and the glory of God, Esa. 32. 15. and 59. 21. 1 Thessalonians. 1. 5.

21. The enemies of Christ are Satan and all his angels with all their works,
to wit, sin and death, Genesis 3. 15. Ephesians. 2. 2. 2. Cor. 4. 4. 2. Cor. 6. 15. to
which we must add all wicked men, who be the instruments of Satan, Ioh. 8.
44. 1. Ioh. 3. 8. amongst whom the Antichrist of Rome is chief, 2 Thessalonians. 2.
3. These enemies Christ has already overcome in his own person, Ephesians. 4. 8.
Col. 2. 14. Io. 12. 31. he does daily bridle and repress by his wisdom,
power, word, and spirit, Luke 10. 18, 19. Luke 2. 34. Reu. 12. 5. and 2. 27. 2.
Cor. 10. 4, 5. and he will perfectly subdue at the day of judgment, 1. Cor.
15. 25. adiudging the devil and all his partakers to eternal condemnation,
Mat. 25. 46. and utterly abolishing sin and death, 1. Cor. 15. 26. Further is
to be noted, that Christ as Mediator in the execution of his Kingly office,
does outwardly call some wicked and ungodly men, Mat. 22. 1. 14. and 20. 16.
prescribe a law how they ought to walk, Iam. 4. 12. bestow many good things
upon them both spiritual and temporal, though not such as accompany
salvation, Heb. 6. 4, 5. Mat. 13. 19, 20, 21. Luke 8. 13, 14. Job 22. 18. and
inflict diverse punishments upon them, in this life and the life to come, for
their sin and disobedience, Matthew. 13. 12. and 25. 28. Es. 6. 10. 2 Thessalonians.
2. 10, 11. Luke 16. 23.

22. Christ does not only by his word call his elect to faith, repentance, and
the participation of the covenant of grace, Mark. 1. 14, 15. Matthew. 11. 28. but
he does also effectually move them by his Spirit to repent and believe, Ps.
110. 3. 2. These. 2. 13, 14. Ephesians. 3. 16, 17.

23. The functions of Christ's Kingly office, appertaining to the government of
his elect, are 1. The prescription of laws according to which his subjects
ought to believe and live; which stands not only in appointing the faithful
by the ministry of his word to live godly, justly, and soberly; but also in
writing his law in their hearts by his holy Spirit, and inabling them by the
same Spirit, to do in some measure what he requires, Tit. 2. 11, 12. Ier.
31. 33. Ezeck. 36. 27. Ioh. 1. 16. 2. The communication and bestowing of all
good things upon them, appertaining to this or a better life, so far as he
knows it needful or profitable: under which we are to comprehend the
remoouing of things hurtful, and the defending of his subjects against them,
Psa. 68. 18. Iam. 1. 16, 17. Ps. 23. 1, 2, 3. 1. Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10, 11. Ephesians. 1.
7. Act. 26. 18. Matthew. 9. 6. Gal. 4. 4, 5. Romans 8. 15, 16. 2. Cor. 12. 9. Phil.
4. 13. Luke 22. 32. Ioh. 17. 11, 12. 22. 23. 1. Ioh. 4. 4. Genesis 9. 26. 27.
Psalm. 81. 13, 14. Act. 4. 16. and 5. 13. Psalm. 34. 9, 10. Tit. 1. 15. Romans 14.
14, 15. Esa. 27. 7. Ier. 46. 28. 3. The receiving of his elect unto himself,
and the giving of eternal life unto them having pronounced sentence on their
side, Matthew. 25. 46.

Q. What benefits do we receive by the death and resurrection of Christ?
A. We are redeemed from the 24 guilt, Col. 1. 14.
punishment 25, and power Luke 2. 74. Tit. 2. 14. 1. Cor. 15. 13.
of sin, and shall be raised up at the last day,

Expos. 24. Christ has paid our debts, and answered whatsoever the law did
require at our hands, 1. Pet. 2. 21. 24. and laid down his life, according to
the will of his Father, Ioh. 10. 15. so that the law has nothing against us,
Col. 2. 14. Christ's death must needs be acceptable, Ephesians. 5. 2. and
consequently we are not bound over to punishment.

25. Punishment is inflicted because of sin, Job. 4. 8. Prou. 22. 8. and 28.
18. Hos. 10. 13. and 14. 1. being freed from sin we are not liable to
judgment, 1. Sam. 12. 13. Ier. 4. 14. Ezeck. 18. 32. It stands not with the
justice of God, being once fully satisfied, to require a second payment at our
hands, Genesis 18. 25. Matthew. 3. 17. neither will it stand with his glorious
mercy, the honor of Christ who is a perfect Redeemer, Tit. 2. 14. the price of
his blood, 1. Cor. 6. 21. nor with our faith in praying for full pardon of all
our debts, Matthew. 6. 12. or our peace with God, Romans 5. 1. nor yet with right
reason, that the guilt of sin should be removed, and yet punishment for
sin inflicted.

Q. How are we redeemed from the guilt and punishment of sin?
A. God the Father accepting the death of Christ as a full Romans 3. 24, 25. Col.
1. 14.
ransom and satisfaction to his justice, does freely discharge and acquit us
from all our sins.

Q. How are we redeemed from the power and tyranny of sin?
A. Christ by 26 his Romans 6. 3. 4.
death kills sin in us, and by his 27 resurrection does quicken us to
newness of life.

Expos. 26. Christ by his death did conquer sin; and the old man in us is
truly said to be crucified, dead, and buried, in and with the body of Christ,
we being ingrafted into the similitude of his death, Col. 2. 12. 20.

27. Having communion with Christ in his life, we are raised up to a spiritual
life, Romans 8. 11. and have our conversation in heaven, Phil. 3. 20. But this
life is only begun here, and grows by degrees, being perfected in heaven.

Q What are the benefits of Christ's ascension?
A. The leading Ephesians. 4. 8. 11.
of captivity captive, the giving of gifts unto men, the pouring Act. 2. 16,
17.
his spirit upon his people, and preparing Ioh. 14. 3.
a place for them.

Q. What are the benefits of his intercession?
A. The persons of the faithful do always remain just, and their works 1.
Pet. 2. 5. Genesis 4. 4. Exodus 28. 38.
acceptable in the sight of God; hereby also they are defended against the
accusations of all their enemies.

Q. How will the knowledge of these things work in the heart of him whom God
will save?
A. It brings him to a serious Ier. 8. 6, 7. Luk 15. 17.
consideration of his own estate, to Act. 2. 37.
grieve for sin, and the fear of Gods displeasure, whereby Act. 9, 6.
the heart is 28 broken and humbled.

Expos. 28. The heart is broken and humbled, when it is cast down with the
sight of sin, Psa. 51. 17. bruised with the weight of Gods wrath, and melted
away for fear, Psalm. 119. 120. 2. Kin. 22. 19. knowing that God has advantage
against him, and that he is worthy to be condemned.

Q. What else will this knowledge work?
A. It will bring Luke 15. 18.
a man 2^ to confess his sin, highly to Matthew. 13. 44.
prize Christ, and hunger 30 after Esa. 55. 1. Ioh. 7. 37.
him until he obtain his desire.

Expos. 29. He will acknowledge his sins to God as particularly as he can, 1.
Tim. 1. 13. and with sighs and groans, for pardon and forgiveness, Romans 8. 26.

30. Hunger after Christ must be fervent, as a thirsty man longs for drink;
and continual, never giving over till the desire be obtained. With this desire
there is always joined an high prizing of Christ, and an advised willingness to
for go all things for Christ's sake, Phi. 1. 22. 23. with 3. 7, 8.

Q. How are we made partakers of Christ with all his benefits?
A. By 1 faith Io. 3. 16. and 1. 12. Act. 13. 39.
alone,

Expos. 1. By faith alone we are ingrafted into Christ, Romans 11. 20. receive
him, Io. 6. 56. have communion with him, Reu. 3. 20. and so are made partakers
of all his benefits, Io. 3. 36. also faith is the condition of the covenant of
grace. Act. 16. 31. Io. 3. 18. Mar. 16. 19. Io. 9. 30. Romans 4. 3. 5.

Q. What is faith?
A. A 2 resisting Psalm. 2. 12. Act. 16. 31.
upon Christ alone for salvation,

Expos. 2. Bare assenting to the truth of Gods promises upon the credit of the
reuealer, is not true and justifying faith, Matthew. 21. 32. Io. 2. 23. Luke 24.
25. Luke 8. 13. but when the poor soul does cast it self upon the free
promise of God made in Jesus Christ, for pardon of sin, it does truly believe,
Act. 9. 42. Io. 14. 1. Io. 5. 24. with Romans 4. 5. Es. 28. 16. with Romans 9. 33.
Act. 18. 8. with Romans 10. 10, 11. This faith is certain, Mat. 16. 18. though
mixed with many doubtings, Luke 1. 18. and 17. 5. Mar. 9. 24. and continual,
Luke 22. 31. 32. though often shaken, Luke 24. 21. A full persuasion seems
rather an effect of a strong faith. Romans 4. 21. then the nature of true faith.
Joy is a fruit of faith, 1. Pet. 1. 8. Act. 8. 6, 7, 8. Romans 5. 4. but not an
inseparable companion thereof; a man may have true faith, and feel little, or
no comfort, Psalm. 22. 1. and 31. 10. and 77. 2.

Q. What is the ground of faith?
A. The free 3 promises of Romans 4. 18. Heb. 11. 11.
God, made in Christ, concerning the forgiveness of sins, and eternal
righteousness.

Expos. 3. Temporal blessings, Eccl. 9. 12. civil virtues, Luke 18. 12, 13.
14. a general notice that Christ will save the elect, Matthew. 13. 20. 21. sense,
reason, experience, feeling, Psalm. 10. 1. and 51. 12. are not the grounds of
says, but only the promises, which God of his grace has made unto us in
Christ, which ought to be received, because God that cannot lie has spoken
them, Tit. 1. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 13.

Q. How is faith wrought in us?
A. Inwardly by Act. 16. 14.
the 4 spirit as the Author, outwardly by the Romans 10. 14. Heb. 5. 11. 12. and
6. 12.
preaching of the word, and 5 Catechizing, as the instrument thereof,

Expos. 4. Faith is the gift of God, Ph. 1. 29. and a grace supernatural; a
man of himself can no more believe, then a corrupt fountain can send forth
sweet waters, 1. Cor. 2. 14.

5. By Catechizing, understand a pure, plain, brief, and orderly instruction
of the people in the chief grounds of Christian religion, 1. Cor. 2. 4. 1.
Cor. 3. 1. 1. Pet. 3. 15. Heb. 6. 1, 2. Romans 6. 17. so that the people may
clearly and manifestly see the way unto salvation, and may know how to make
use both of the Law, and of the Gospel, for their humiliation and comfort,
understanding how one thing depends upon another, goes before, or follows
after.

Hereby Christians are enabled to refer that which they read, to some head,
readily to apply what they hear, to fit purpose, try it, and have it in
readiness, in the time of need. In a word to profit by the public
ministry, Heb. 5. 11, 12. and to know how to go forward in godliness in an
holy method. To say nothing that Catechizing is profitable to inform the
judgment, reform the affection, and quicken both to the duties of a Godly
life.

Q. How does the word work faith in us?
A. By showing us Romans 7. 7. Gal. 3. 22.
our misery, and the true Gal. 4. 4, 5.
means of our recovery, encouraging us Matthew. 11. 28. Es. 61. 1, 2, 3. Reu.
22. 17.
being 6 humbled, to receive the promises of the Gospel,

Expos. 6. The word commands the humbled to believe, promises them comfort,
Matthew. 9. 13. Luke 15. 32. sets forth the necessity, and exellency of faith,
Io. 3. 18. 39. the danger of unbelief, Mar. 16. 15. Io. 12. 48. Act. 13. 46.
the tender mercies and compassions of the Lord, Psalm. 103. 8. 12. and how he
inuiteth, persuades, and entreats him to believe, 2. Cor. 5. 20.

Q. How does the Spirit work by the word?
A. It does teach us wisdom Ezekiel. 36. 37. 31.
to apply things generally spoken, particularly to our selves, secretly
vpholdeth against despair, stirs up Ph. 2. 13.
in us good desires, does Ezekiel. 11. 19. and 36. 26.
soften the heart, and draw Ioh. 6. 44.
us to rest upon Christ for salvation, before we Matthew. 11. 28. 29.
have the feeling of comfort, k Psalm. 51. 12.


Q. By what means is faith increased?
A. By 7 hearing 1. Pet. 2. 2.
the same word preached or Catechized, and likewise Luke 17. 5.
by earnest 8 prayer.

Expos. 7. Hearing the word preached, is ordained of God as a means to
increase knowledge, Matthew. 15. 10. Pro. 1. 5. and 8. 33. Psalm. 73. 16. 17. 1.
Cor. 1. 21. and 14. 24. 25. to rectify the judgment, to give counsel in
doubtful cases, Psa. 119. 24. Psalm. 73. 16. 17. to perfect the faith of the
weak, Romans 10. 8. 1 Thessalonians. 3. 10. to make stable the strong, Act. 20. 32.
Romans 1. 11. 12. to comfort them that are in heaviness, 1. These. 2. 11. and 3. 2.
and 5. 14. to raise them that are fallen, 2. Sam. 12. 12. 13. Gal. 6. 1. to
call back them that wander, Es. 30. 21. to stir up the graces of Gods
spirit, Cant. 4. 16. 2. Pet. 1. 13. to refresh the souls of the Saints with
sweet and heavenly consolations, Cant. 1. 1. Psalm. 119. 162. Col. 2. 2. and to
build both weak and strong, unto perfect holiness, Ephesians. 4. 11. 1. Pet. 5. 2. 1.
Tim. 4. 16. Iam. 1. 21.

8. As liberty to pray is a sweet privilege Ephesians. 2. 18. because thereby we
do, and may continually commune with the Lord after a familiar manner, 2. Sam.
7. 18. Psalm. 5. 1, 2, 3. and lay open our griefs into his bosom, 1. Sam. 1.
15. Ps. 130. 1. 2. and 61. 1, 2. we do testific our dutiful affection to him,
Luke 15. 18. and become helpers to others; Romans 15. 30. Ph. 1. 19. 2. These. 3.
1. Col. 4. 12. so it does add strength to faith, Luke 17. 5. for it gives life
to the graces of God that are in us: by it we obtain at the hand of God what
good we stand in need of, Matthew. 7. 7. Is. 65. 24. we grow better acquainted
with God, Genesis 18. 23. 27. Iam. 4. 8. we fight manfully against corruption,
Ephesians. 6. 18. and learn to direct our selves in a godly life: by it crosses are
prevented, removed, or sanctified, Ps. 3. 4. Es. 37. 1. 6. al things are
sanctified, 1. Tim. 4. 5. and we kept that we fall not into temptation, Matthew.
26. 41. yea often we obtain much mort good, then we desire or expect, 1. Kin.
3. 13. Ephesians. 3. 20. So that prayer is a key to open the door of Gods
treasure-house, Matthew. 7. 7. a present remedy to an oppressed mind, Psalm. 6. 1.
8. and 31. 21. 22. a preserver of the godly mind, 2. These. 3. 5. a giver of
strength to the weak, Ephesians. 3. 14. 16. and an especial means to make a man
fit to live in every e^tate, Col. 1. 9. 10.

Q. How must we hear that we may get profi?
A. 9 With Es. 66. 2.
reverence, Iam. 1. 21.
meekenes 10, joy 11, a Matthew. 13. 44.
longing 12 desire 1. Pet. 2. 2.
to learn^, and giving 13 credit to the truth. w Heb. 4. 1. 2.


Expos. 9. Reverence is an affection of the heart, arising from an apprehension
of Gods majesty, and our own vileness, whereby we are prepared to hear the
word with humility, fear, and attention, Act. 10. 33. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Io.
12. 48. and 11. 28. Heb. 11. 28. Job. 42. 5. 6. Psa. 62. 11. Act. 16. 14.

10. Meekenes is an affection, whereby we are contented to bear the rebukes of
the law, and to have the duties of the word, to be pressed upon us, 1. Sam. 3.
18. 2. King. 20. 19. Psalm. 25. 9. 12. Heb. 13. 22.

11. Joy is a delight of the soul for some good thing that is present, Act. 8.
8. Ex. 6. 9.

12. A longing desire to learn, is an eager appetite to be further acquainted
with the knowledge of the truth, that we may reap fruit, and benefit by the
same, Pro. 27. 7. Pro. 2. 3. 4. 9. Psa. 119. 34. 40. 5. 35. and 7. 17.

13. To give credit to the truth, is to believe the whole truth and every part
of it, as true, and certain, both to others and to our selves, so as we expect
the benefit promised therein, and the effecting and making void of whatsoever
is there spoken. 2. Chron. 20. 20. Esa. 7. 9.

Q. How else?
A. We must Psalm. 1. 2. and 119. 14. 15.
meditate 14 of that we hear, apply it to our 15 selves, confer of Ioh. 4.
53.
it with 16 others, and with Esa. 2. 3. Luke 2. 51.
diligence 17 set about the practice of what is required.

Expos. 14. Meditation is the very life of reading and hearing, 1. Tim. 4. 15.
and it is a separation of our selves purposely from other matters, that we may
seriously think of what has been taught, Genesis 24. 63. that it may be settled in
the mind, and work upon the affections, Ier. 8. 6. for which end we must join
examination and prayer, Luke 18. 1.

15. To apply the word to our selves, is to lay it to our heart as concerning
us, 1. Cor. 11. 28. 2. Cor. 13. 5. that the commandments may guide us, the
threatenings may humble us for sins past, 2. Sam. 12. 12, 13. and 24. 10. and
affright us from sin to come, the exhortations may incite us to our duty
with cheerfulness, Eccl. 12. 11. and the promises may be for our support and
comfort, whether they be in plain speeches, or mystical prophesies, Psalm.
119. 71, 72. 52. ver.

16. We must communicate to others what we have learned, and learn of others
what we are ignorant of, do not well understand, or have forgotten; and by
admonition, exhortation, and comfort, help to strengthen and edify one
another, Heb. 3. 13. Job 16. 4, 5. Romans 1. 11, 12. Leu. 19. 17. Prou. 27. 5, 6.
1 Thessalonians. 5. 11. 14. Jude v. 20.

17. Inwardly we must heartily desire and strive, and outwardly we must be
careful without delays to take all opportunities of doing the good that God
requires, 2. Chron. 17. 6. and 19. 3. and 27. 6. Luke 8. 15. being humbled
for negligence and sin past, watching and fighting against corruption for the
time to come, 1. Cor. 9. 26, 27. cherishing one another with befitting
comforts, Esa. 40. 1.

Q. What is Prayer?
A. It is 1 a calling upon God in the name of Christ, with the Exo. 14. 15. 1.
Sam. 1. 13. 15.
heart, and sometimes with the 2 voice, according to 1. Ioh. 5. 14.
his will for our selves and others.

Expos. 1. The Commandments, Ps. 105. 1. 4. and 81. 10. Esa. 55. 6. 1 Thessalonians.
5. 17. Romans 12. 12. promises, Matthew. 7. 7. and 21. 22. Mar. 11. 24. Psa. 91.
15. Es. 65. 24. Ier. 29. 12. Esa. 49. 17. Ioh. 16. 23. threatenings of the Lord,
Zeph. 3. 12. Ezec. 22. 30, 31. Dan. 9. 13, 14. Matthew. 26. 41. the examples of
Christ himself, and all his people, Luke 3. 21. and 9. 18, 29. Act. 1. 14. 24.
and 2. 42. and 4. 24. and 9. 11. 14. 2. Tim. 2. 19. 22. our own necessities,
Iud. 3. 9. 15. and 4. 3. Esa. 26. 16. Psa. 18. 6. Phil. 4. 6. and success of
prayer, Ps. 120. 1. Psa. 3. 4. Ps. 32. 5, 6. are sufficient motives and reasons
to induce us to the practice of this duty.

2. It is lawful to use the voice in prayer, to quicken our dullness, inflame
our devotion, prevent rouings, and to edify our brethren, Zeph. 3. 9. Psa. 88.
1.

Q. To whom must we pray?
A. To 3 God Ioh. 16. 23. Col. 3. 17.
alone in the name 4 of Christ.

Expos. 3. God only is every where present, Ier. 23. 23, 24. knows all
hearts, 1. Kin. 8. 39. Ier. 17. 9. Psa. 94. 9, 10. hears all prayers. Neh. 1.
6. Psa. 65. 2. Ps. 66. 19, 20. is most able to help, Ps. 57. 2. Ephesians. 3. 20.
prayer is a divine worship, Psalm. 15. and 44. 20, 21. a spiritual sacrifice,
Matthew. 1. 11. Psa. 141. 2. Reu. 8. 4. and 5. 8. Exodus 22. 20. and in God only
we ought to believe, Ioh. 14. 1. therefore he only is to be called upon, Romans
10. 13, 14. as the very Heathen saw by the light of nature, Ion. 1. 5.

4. To pray in the name of Christ, is not rudely and customarily to say these
words, Through Jesus Christ our Lord, etc. but in the confidence of the merits
and intercession of Cerist, to call on our heavenly Father, Dan. 9. 17. Since
the fall of man, none are called to come to God, or have a promise to speed,
but in the name of a Mediator, Ioh. 14. 6. Heb. 4. 16. 1. Tim. 2. 5. 1. Ioh. 2.
1. Romans 8. 33. Hebr. 7. 25. in Christ alone we have access to the throne of
grace, Ephesians. 2. 18. and 3. 12. Angels or Saints departed do not present our
prayers before God: for Christ only is our Mediator and high Priest, who
gets our prayers acceptance before God, Heb. 1. 3. and 4. 14. Reu. 8. 3. and
to present our prayers before God, and to procure them acceptance with God, is
in phrase of Scripture all one. Dan. 10. 12. Act. 10. 4. 31.

Q. Ought we not in prayer to make particular confession of our sins?
A. Yes, so far as 1. Sam. 12. 19. Psalm. 19. 13.
we can come to the knowledge of them, and this we must do Neh. 8. 9.
with 4 grief, 5 hatred, and 6 shame, freely Neh. 9. 33.
accusing and condemning our selves before God, with Zac. 12. 10.
broken and contrite hearts.

Expos. 4. Sorrow for sin must be hearty and continual, and as much as may
be particular, Psa. 102. 4. especially for the sins which have made great
breaches in the soul, Psa. 51. 1, 2, 4. yea sin should be our chief sorrow.

5. The soul should abhor sin, especially for the loathsomeness of it,
Psa. 97. 10. Psa. 119. 163. Job 42. 6. Amos 5. 15. darkening Gods glory, Genesis
39. 9. breaking his law, soiling all it touches, 2. Cor. 7. 1. Iam. 1. 21.
Hag. 2. 12, 13.

6. God is infinite in Majesty, Psa. 86. 10. and of pure eyes, Hab. 1. 13. a
man therefore should blush at the remembrance and confession of sins before
God, Ezr. 9. 6. and Dan. 9. 7. seeing his face would be covered with shame, if
a man should know them.

Q. What are the parts of Prayer?
A. Petition and Thanksgiving.

Q. What is Petition?
A. It is a Prayer wherein we desire the preventing Esa. 37. 20. Matthew. 6. 13.
, or Psa. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.
remoouing of things hurtful, and the obtaining of things needful either for
this life, or that which is to come.

Q. How may we make our requests that we may be heard?
A. With 1. Cor. 14. 15.
understanding 6, Mat. 11. 28.
feeling 7 of our wants, Iam. 5. 17.
8 feruencie, Eccl. 5. 2.
9 reverence, 1. Tim. 2. 8.
hope 10 to speed, and Mat. 6. 14. Mar. 11. 25.
love 11.

Expos. 6. Blind devotion is not pleasing to God, Prou. 19. 2. Act. 17. 22, 23,
24. Ioh. 4. 22. who requires to be served with the mind, Mat. 22. 37. Luke 10.
27. We must therefore know the will of God, appearing by his commandments,
promises, threatenings, and the approved practice of the Saints, that we must
desire and pray for, and only so as we know Gods word does warrant us, 1.
Ioh. 5. 14. Our words, matter, and meaning in prayer, are meet to be understood.

7. In prayer we should feel sin as a burden, Ier. 31. 18. Esa. 63. 17. and
be pinched with our want of grace, Psa. 51. 10, 11, 12. Iam. 1. 5. which
arises from a consideration of Gods judgments due to sin, Ezra. 9. 6, 7. and
of the necessity of saving grace, Luke 17. 5. 2. Cor. 12. 9.

8. As the things we beg are more or less excellent, and of fit use for us,
so we must be more or less eager to obtain, Psa. 51. 1, 2, 3, 9. and 80. 1,
2, 3, 4. which arises from a consideration of the necessity and excellency
of what we desire, Psa. 79. 8, 9. and 86. 1. Psalm. 102. 13, 14. as also from a
burning zeal of Gods glory, and hearty love of our brethren, Esa. 62. 1.
Psalm. 122. 6, 7, 8. opposite hereunto is hypocrisy and vain babbling, Matthew.
6. 5, 6, 7.

9. Considering Gods excellent majesty, we may not rashly conceive or utter
any thing before him but with reverence, Genesis 18. 27. 30. 32. which is an
unfeigned abasement of the mind, proceeding from a consideration of Gods divine
majesty, and our own indignity, Luke 15. 21. Genesis 32. 10. Esr. 9. 6. Heb.
12. 28.

10. Having a promise from God that he will grant our requests, Psa. 34. 19.
Esa. 30. 19. and 58. 9. we must believe his word, for he is true and faithful,
Heb. 11. 11. 2. Tim. 2. 13. If hope to speed accompany not our prayers, they
are vain, Iam. 1. 6. But yet this hope is weak, feeble, and many times seems
to be overwhelmed in the godly, Psalm. 13. 1, 2. and 31. 22 and 77. 7, 8, 9.

11. By love is meant, that we must forgive our enemies, and carry an hearty
affection to the children of God. Ephesians. 4. 32. Col. 3. 12, 13.

Q. What is thanksgiving?
A. It is 12 a 1. Sam. 2. 1.
prayer, wherein we render Psa. 136. 1. and
thanks to God for his general goodness, and particular Psalm. 103. 1, 2, 3,
4, 5.
favors.

Expos. 12. Motives to this duty there be many. It is an excellent, Psalm. 92.
1. ancient, Job 38. 7. spiritual duty, Heb. 13. 15. Col. 3. 16. 1. Pet. 2.
5. to be continued in heaven when other duties cease, Reu. 19. 3, 4, 5.
acceptable to God, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 18. Psa. 147. 1. comely for the Saints, Psa.
33. 1. and 147. 1. practiced by the Angels, Luke 2. 13. setting on work all
the graces of God in us, Psa. 103. 1, 2, 3. the end of Gods benefits, Psa. 13.
6. 118. 29. of our life, and all our services, Esa. 38. 19. and the ready way
to obtain what we stand in need of, Psa. 50. 23. The means of true
thankfulness, are a due consideration of our own vileness, and a serious
meditation and remembrance of Gods benefits, 2. Sam. 7. 18. 1. Chr. 16. 16, 17.
Psalm. 103. 1, 2, 3. etc. 1. Sam. 25. 32. Genesis 24. 27. Luke 17. 15. Romans 7. 25.
with a persuasion that God has in love bestowed them upon us, Psalm. 116. 12.
14.

Q. What things are required in Thanksgiving?
A. Love Psalm. 18. 1. 2.
to God, and Psalm. 126. 1, 2. and 104. 34.
joy in his mercy, a Psa. 34. 11. and. 66. 16.
desire to draw others to obey and glorify God, and an Deuteronomy. 6. 10, 11, 12,
13. 1. Sam. 12. 14.
endeavor to proceed in godliness our selves.

Q. What rule of direction is there, according to which we ought to frame our
prayers?
A. The general Direction is the word of God, the more especial is the 1
Lords prayer.

Expos. 1. The Lords prayer is so a direction, that it may be lawfully, and
laudably, used as a Prayer, Mat. 6. 9. etc. Luke 11. 2. etc. Numb. 6. 23, 24.
Psalm. 22. 1. and 92. 1. It is called the Lords prayer, because the Lord Jesus
taught it to his Disciples, Luke 11. 1, 2.

Q. How many things are to be considered in the Lords Prayer?
A. Three, the preface, the prayer it self, and the conclusion.

Q. Which is the preface?
A. Our 2 Father which art in heaven.

Q. What learn you out of this Preface?
A. That God is our Esa. 63. 16.
Father by grace Romans 8. 15, 16. Gal. 4. 4, 5.
and adoption, thorough Jesus Christ, Psalm. 47. 2.
glorious in majesty, and Psalm. 115. 3.
infinite in power, that both Ephesians. 3. 20.
can, and Psa. 50. 15.
have promised to help us.

Expos. 2. There is no Christian, so poor, weak, or unworthy in his own
eyes, but he is allowed to call God Father, Ier. 3. 19.

Q. What are you to consider in the Lords prayer it self?

Q Which is the first petition?
A. Hallowed 3 be thy 4 Name.

men by nature being his bondslaues, Ephesians. 2. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 26. living in
ignorance, error, impiety, and disobedience, Ephesians. 4. 18. and Christ has his
kingdom, Col. 1. 13. to wit, his Church, which is the company of mankind, 1.
Pet. 2. 9. Ephesians. 5. 23. in heaven and earth, Ephesians. 3. 15. Col. 1. 20. called
from the world, Romans 8. 30. unto salvation thorough him, Act. 4. 12. In this
world it is redeemed, called, sanctified, 1. Cor. 1. 30. after this life it is
glorified, Mat. 25. 34. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 10.

9. The government which Christ exercises over all men, and all other
creatures, Ephesians. 1. 21. 22. Heb. 1. 6, 7. is not here meant; but the special
government, which he exercises over his Church, Ephesians. 5. 23. in this life, and
the life to come.

Q. What do you desire of God in this petition?
A. That 10 Christ would Cant. 8. 8. Act. 7. 60.
convert such as be under the power of Satan, Ephesians. 3. 16. 17.

11, 12.
perfect their salvation in heaven hereafter,

Expos. 10. Particularly we desire that God would send forth his word, Mat. 9.
37. give it free passage, Ephesians. 6. 19. Romans 15. 30, 31, 32. powerfully accompany
it by his spirit, Deuteronomy. 33. 8. 10. 2. Cor. 10. 4, 5. to bring his chosen from

to judgment, Reu. 22. 20.

Q. Which is the third petition?
A. Thy 11 will 12 be 13 done in earth, as it is in 14 heaven.

Expos. 11. Man by nature does the will of the flesh, and Satan, Ephesians. 2. 3. Io.
8. 44. but he ought to desire and do, not his own will, Romans 8. 6. Matthew. 26.
39. but the will of God, Esa. 26. 8. Psa. 119. 5. 106.

12. The word of God revealed in the old and new Testament, is the will of God.

13. To do Gods will is to obey it: Exo. 24. 7.

14. In heaven the Saints departed, and the Angels, obey the Lord, Heb. 12. 23.
Psalm. 103. 20. In earth men living are to be obedient, Exodus 24. 3. 1. Sam.

168. Phil. 4. 13. In this life perfectly we cannot do the will of God, 2. Sam
12. 9. and 13. 39. and 24. ^0. 2. Chron. 35. 22. Luke 1. 6. 20. as the Angels
do: But we must desire, strive after, and hope for perfection, Luke 13. 24.
Phil. 1. 6. obeying with sincerity, Genesis 5. 24. and 17. 1. Mic. 6. 8. as the
Angels do, though not in the same degree, 1. Cor. 13. 9. 10.

Q. Which is the fourth petition?
A. 16 Give us this 17 day, 18 our 19 daily 20 bread.

Expos. 16. All both poor and rich must pray, Give us, because we have nothing
but by Gods free gift, 1 Cor. 4. 7. Iam. 1. 17. have title to nothing, but in
Christ Jesus, Heb. 1. 2. with Romans 8. 32. can keep nothing but by the Lords
license, Job. 1. 12. neither can any thing prosper with us but, by his
blessing, Deu. 8. 16. Pro. 10. 22. Psalm. 127. 1. 2. Hag. 1. 6. Esa. 3.

17. We may provide for the time to come in a lawful manner, when God gives
opportunity, Ephesians. 4. 28. Genesis 41. 34. 35. etc. and 50. 20. 2. Cor. 12. 14. Act.
11. 28. But yet we must ever wait upon Gods providence, 1. Pet. 5. 7. Psalm.
55. 22. both when we have the means, Pro. 3. 5, 6. and when we want them,
Esa. 28. 16. casting off distrust, excessive, distracting, unprofitable, and
needles cares, Mat. 6. 25. etc. to the end.

18. Bread is said to be Ours, when it is gotten by just and lawful means,
Ephesians. 4. 28. in a good and honest calling, Genesis 3. 19. our persons being
accepted of God in Jesus Christ, 1. Cor. 3. 22, 23. for that which we so
possess, is given us of God in love and mercy.

19. By daily bread is meant, bread for the supply of our present necessity, or
rather that which is fit for us, or agreeable to our present condition, Pro.
30. 8, 9.

20. By bread, is not meant the bread of life, which is Christ, Ioh. 6. 48. but
all outward things, Pro. 27. 27. Ier. 11. 19. Pro. 31. 14. for our necessity,
and Christian delight. Psalm. 104. 15. Io. 12. 3.

Q. What desire you of God in this petition?
A. That 21 God would bestow on us, all things necessary for this life, as
food, maintenance, etc.

Expos. 21. Here we pray for food and raiment, Genesis 28. 20. sleep, Ps. 3. 5.
and 4. 8. fitting delig^ts, Ps. 23. 5. Pro. 5. 18, 19. Genesis 21. 8. and 29. 22.
and for contentation with our estates, Heb. 13. 5. 1. Tim. 6. 6. though they be
mean, Phil. 4. 12. 1. Tim. 6. 8. resting on God^ providence, Prou. 16. 3. love
of justice, Job 29. 14. faithfulness and painfulnesse in our callings, 2.
These. 3. 12. joy and thankfulness, Deuteronomy. 28. 49. and 8. 10, 11. and Gods
blessing upon them, Genesis 24. 12. Psa. 67. 1. 6, 7. and the sanctification of
whatsoever we enjoy, 1. Tim. 4. 4. as also for peace, Psalm. 122. 7, 8.
protection by the Magistrate, 1. Tim. 2. 12. seasonable weather, etc. 1. King.
8. 35, 36. Hosh. 2. 21. Deuteronomy. 28. 12. valiant soldiers, 2. Sam. 23. 8, 9, 10,
to 39. learned and good Physicians, Col. 4. 14. And we pray against
covetousness, Psa. 119. 36. distracting cares, Mat. 6. 34. distrust, Psalm. 78.
22. discontent with our estate, 1. Tim. 6. 10. idleness, Matthew. 20. 3. 6.
oppression, in justice, carelessness, unjust war, or whatsoever does
unlawfully hurt and impeach our outward prosperity.

Q. Which is the fifth petition?
A. And 22 forgive us our 23 trespasses, as we 24 forgive them 25 that
trespass against us.

Expos. 22. To forgive sin, is to cover it, put it away out of sight, and not
to impute it, or call to a reckoning for it. Psa. 32. 1, 2.

23. Sins are called trespasses or debts, Mat. 18. 25. because we are bound
to make satisfaction for them by suffering the just judgment of God, Luke 11.
4. Genesis 2. 17. if the divine justice be not satisfied by another. Col. 1. 20.

24. Our forgiving others, is not a cause why God forgiues us, Matthew. 18. 32.
33. Col. 3. 13. 1. Ioh. 4. 10, 11. but a sign whereby we are assured that God
has pardoned us. Mat. 6. 14, 15. and 5. 23, 24. Matthew. 7. 11.

25. The wrong that is done unto us (though not always the damage, 2. Chr. 19.
6. 1. Tim. 5. 8. Ephesians. 5. 29. Exodus 22. 1. 15. Act. 16. 37. compared) we ought
to forgive, Mar. 11. 25. but the sin being the breach of the divine law, God
only can pardon, Psa. 51. 1. 4.

Q. What desire you of God in this petition?
A. That 26 God of his free Es. 43. 45.
mercy in Jesus Christ, would fully Psa. 51. 2.
pardon all our sins, as Luke 11. 4.
we do pardon the wrongs and injuries we receive from others.

Expos. 26. In this petition we acknowledge our selves to be miserable sinners,
Psa. 40. 12. Psa. 25. 11. Ezr. 9. 6. and that we have no power to satisfy for
sin, Psalm. 49. 7, 8. Act. 2. 37, 38. Ezec. 16. 4, 5. and that God is patient,
bearing with us so long, Lam. 3. 22. Psalm. 145. 8. Psalm. 86. 5. 15. and 103. 8.
and merciful, not giving leave only, Dan. 9. 18, 19. 2. Chro. 7. 14. but
commanding also to pray for pardon, Hosh. 14. 1, 2. whereby he gives hope of
forgiveness: and hence we are drawn to flee to the throne of grace, Ps. 86.
15, 16. Joel 2. 12, 13. for the full forgiveness both of guilt and punishment,
Ps. 51. 1, 2. Every day we sin, Eccl. 7. 21. Job 14. 4. and therefore every
day we must pray for pardon, Ps. 55. 17. and our faith is weak, Luke 24. 21,
22, 23. Romans 14. 1. We must pray daily, that we may have greater assurance of
our salvation* Lu. 17. 5. 2. Sam. 12. 13. with Psa. 51. 1, 2.

Q. Which is the sixth petition?
A. And 27 lead us not into temptation, but deliver 28 us from evil*

Expos. 27. Forgiveness of sins, and grievous temptations, are inseparable
companions, Luke 11. 21, 22. 24, 25, 26. Act. 9. 17. 23, 24. Temptation is any
trial whereby the heart is enticed to sin, by Satan, the world, or the
flesh, 1. These. 3. 5. Iam. 1. 14. Matt. 26. 41. God is said to tempt his
servants to try and humble them, by offering occasions of sin, sending
afflictions, and deferring to help, Deuteronomy. 13. 3. Deuteronomy. 8. 2. Genesis 22. 1. Psa.
10. 1. but this in respect of God is ever good, Matthew. 19. 17. Hab. 1. 13. Iam.
1. 13. Satan, the world, and the flesh, are said to tempt, by enticing always
unto sin. Satan by inward suggestions, 1. Chron. 21. 1. Ioh. 13. 2. and
outward objects, 2. Sam. 11. 2, 3. Matthew. 4. 3, 4, 8. The world by bad
examples, Ier. 44. 17. or wicked persuasions, alluring or terrifying, Genesis 3.
6. and 39. 7. and Job 2. 9. 1. Kin. 13. 8. Mat. 16. 22. Act. 21. 12. The flesh
tempts when we are enticed of our own corruption, Obad. 3. Iam. 1. 14. 1.
Pet. 2. 11. Temptation has these degrees; suggestion, delight, consent, and
practice, Iam. 1. 14. To be lead into temptation, is to be overcome of
temptation; so that Satan does prevail against us, and get the victory,
Matthew. 26. 41. 1. Chron. 21. 1. God is said to lead into temptation, when in
any trial he does forsake man, does withold or withdraw from him his grace,
suffer him to fall, 2. Chro. 32. 31. harden his heart, Exodus 3. and give him
wholly up into Satan's power, and the full sway of his own corrupt heart, Romans
1. 24. 26. 28.

28. To deliver, is either to support under, or else to protect and defend from
evil, 2. Cor. 12. 9. By evil, the power and poison of sin, Satan, and the
world is understood, Matthew. 5. 37.

Q. What desire you of God in this petition?
A. To be freed from 29 trialls themselves, so far Matthew. 26. 39.
as it will stand with Gods good pleasure; and always from the evil thereof,
Romans 8. 28. 1. Cor. 10. 13.
that we faint not under them, or be foiled by them.

Expos. 29. Here we acknowledging the Lords power over our enemies that tempt
us, Zach. 3. 2. Jude 9. and our own frailty, Psa. 103. 14, 15. withal
bewayling our pronenesse to evil and corruption, Romans 7. 24. 18. we desire
God to bridle Satan, 2. Cor. 12. 7, 8. kill sin, Psalm. 19. 13. support us by
his grace, Ephesians. 3. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 3. 13. stir us up to be watchful in
prayer, Ephesians. 6. 18. give us hope, patience, consolation, Col. 1. 11. 2 Thessalonians.
2. 17. and a good issue out of all trialls, Psalm. 6. 4. that we neither presume
nor despair, Pro. 30. 9. and free us from misery, so far as may stand with
his good pleasure.

Q. Which is the Thanksgiving in the Lords Prayer?
A. For thine is the 30 kingdom, the 31 power, and the 32 glory, for ever and
ever.

Expos. 30. God is the right owner, and supreme and absolute ruler over all
things in heaven and earth, Genesis 14. 19. 1. Chr. 29. 11. Psalm. 24. 13. all
blessings therefore are to be craved at his hands, Psalm. 145. 14, 15, 16. for
whether should subjects flee, but to their King? Psa. 70. 5. Ps. 2. 9, 10, 11,
12.

31. God can give whatsoever we stand in need of, Matthew. 7. 7. and 8. 2.
strengthen* us against any sin, 2. Tim. 4. 18. Jude 24. and unto any duty,
Heb. 13. 21. and we have no strength but from him, 1. Chro. 29. 15, 16. 2. Cor.
3. 5. therefore we must call upon him alone.

32. God ought to be glorified by us in all things, Col. 3. 17. gains glory
by hearing the prayers of his people, Ps. 79. 11. Psa. 50. 15. and 30. 11, 12.
and for his glory will not deny them any thing that shall be good. Matthew. 7.
11. Luke 11. 13.

Q. Do not these words contain a reason also, why we beg the former
blessings at the hands of God?
A. Yes, for seeing the kingdom, power, and glory are the Lords, we should
call upon him in all our necessities. 1. Chro. 29. 11. 13.


Q. Which is the Conclusion of the Lords Prayer?
A. Amen, which is a witnessing of our faith, and desire of the things prayed
for. Ier. 11. 5.


Q. What does Amen 3^ signify?
A. So it is, or so be it. 1. Kin. 1. 36. Ier. 28. 6. and 11. 5.


Expos. 33. Amen, is sometimes a title of Christ, Reu. 3. 14. because of his
faithfulness and truth in performing all promises, 2. Cor. 1. 20. In the
beginning of sentences, it is an earnest asseueration, Ioh. 6. 26. Matthew. 24.
47. Luke 12. 44. But when it is added in the end of blessings, prayers, or
imprecations, it implies both a desire of the thing so to be, and confidence
that so it shall be, Number. 5. 22. Deuteronomy. 27. 15. 1. Cor. 14. 16. Christ teaching
us to end our prayers with Amen, does thereby admonish us, both to desire grace
of God, and to believe that God presently hears, and will certainly in due
time grant our request, 1. Cor. 14. 16. so that coldness, d^ubting, distrust,
are to be striuen against, 1. Tim. 2. 8. Iam. 1. 6.

Q. What must we do after we have prayed?
A. Observe how 34 we Psalm. 3. 4. and 85. 8.
speed, and what answer we receive.

Expos. 34. Here we must know, that God does hear and grant our requests,
when yet he does defer to give us the sense thereof, Esa. 65. 24. 2. Sam.
12, 13. with Psa. 51. 1, 2. Dan. 9. 22. 23. and 10. 12, 13. Also he does not
always give the particular thing we ask, but what he knows best for us, Romans
1. 10. 2. Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9. Heb. 5. 7. Further, we must take heed, that we
limit not the Lord to our own time, Esa. 28. 16. nor yet receive Satan's
answer f^r the Lords: Satan's answer is either contrary to the word of truth;
or if he speak the truth, it is to a wrong end, viz. despair or
profaneness. Lastly, observe that we speed well when God gives us the same
thing that we crave, being good, Lam. 3. 57. Genesis 30. 19. 22. and 20. 17. Psa.
21. 2. 4. Exodus 17. 11. Josh. 10. 13. or another as fit, or more fit for us,
Genesis 17. 18, 19. Mar. 14. 35. with Heb. 5. 7. or more patience and strength to
wait, 2. Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9. Psalm. 40. 1.

Q. What benefit shall we gain hereby?
A. It will stir up the heart to Psa. 31. 21, 22.
thankfulness 35, remove Psa. 88. 13. and 4. 1, 2.
36 dullness and 37 negligence, strengthen 38 our Psalm. 4. 3.
faith, and inflame 39 our hearts with Psalm. 116. 1. Psalm. 28. 6, 7.
zeal, joy, and love.

Expos. 25. The hearing of our holy prayers is a pledge of Gods love, and a
sweet, and comfortable testimony of of his mercy, Psalm. 31. 21. 22. provoking
the heart cheerfully to praise, Psa. 30. 8. 10, 11, 12.

36. When God answeareth our prayers, the light of his countenance shines upon
us, and this reuiueth the dull spirits, Psalm. 116. 6, 7. 9. 2. Sam. 2. 27.

37. Experience of good received from God, and begged in prayer, does quicken
us thereunto, Psalm. 68. 6, 7. and 116. 1, 2.

38. God is unchangeable, so that former mercies given, do assure us of future
blessings, Psalm. 61. 5, 6.

39. Though our hearts are cold by nature, yet the sight of Gods love does
move us effectually to love the Lord again, Psalm. 145. 18, 19, 20. 21.

Q. What must we do if God answer us not the first or second time?
A. Examine 40 how we Iam. 4. 3.
pray, and Luke 18. 1.
continue 41 fervent therein, waiting Hab. 2. 3. Psalm. 5. 3.
upon the Lord until we speed.

Expos. 40. Sometimes we ask and receive not, because we ask amiss,
ignorantly, rashly, coldly, with wearines, distrustfully, and without love,
Job. 27. 9. Pro. 21. 13. asking either things not good, Matthew. 20. 21. 22. Luke
9. 54, 55. or not fit for them for whom we pray, or to a wrong end. But here
observe that they do pray well, that do take notice of their wants in prayer,
Psalm. 31. 22. and sometimes the child of God prays best, when he knows not
that he prays at all, Romans 8. 28. Also God sometimes gives us what we pray
for, when we pray but coldly, Man. 9. 22. 24, 25. that he might encourage us to
pray, and denies us sometimes when we pray fervently, that we might not trust
to our prayers, Psa. 22. 2.

41. God for a time may deny what we ask, Psalm. 6. 3. and 13. 1. that he may
exercise our humility in regard of our wants, Lam. 3. 44. Iud. 10. 13. 14. our
faith and patience in waiting, Matthew. 15. 22, 23, 24. 26, 27, 28. and try our
obedience whither we will in conscience obey, though we want the comfort
promised, Psalm. 44. 17, 18, 19. 26. Moreover, he deferreth to help for a
season, to quicken us to prayer, make us know our selves, carefully preserve
his graces when once we have them, and do us good in the latter end, Iud. 20.
26. we should not then be faint hearted, but hold out unto the end, being
supported with faith, hope, and love, Psalm. 40. 1. and 37. 7.

Q. Who ought to pray?
A. Though God require Matthew. 7. 7, 8. Psalm. 14. 2.
it of all men upon earth, yet it more specially belongs to the members of
Ioh. 16. 23. 26.
the Church militant.

Q. Who can or may pray with hope to speed?
A. Only they Psalm. 66. 18.
that 42 depart from iniquity.

Expos. 42. Such only as feel the burden of sin, and have a desire to be
eased, are called to come unto Christ; and have a promise to find good
success, Es. 55. ^. Matthew. 11. 28. Others do but mock God, Psalm. 78. 34. 35,
36. neither can they pray with the graces required, as faith, reverence,
feruencie, love, etc. so long as they love wickedness, Zach. 12. 10. 2. Tim. 2.
19. Prayer is not a work of nature, but of the spirit of sanctification, Romans
8. 15. 28. Gal. 4. 4, 5. and he cannot fulfill the lusts of the flesh, that has
the spirit of grace, dwelling in him, Gal. 5. 16. so that the prayers of the
wicked, are an abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15. 8. Io. 9. 31. Esa. 58. 7, 8,
9. Ezekiel. 17. 18. Our deparing of sin is at the first very rude and imperfect,
Io. 21. 15. 1. Pet. 2. 1. we must pray daily to be renewed, Col. 1. 9. Phi. 1.
9. 10. 11. 1. These. 3. 23.

Q. For whom must we pray?
A. For 43 all 1. Tim. 2. 1.
sorts of men now living, or that shall live Io. 17. 20.
hereafter, but 44 not for the Luke 16. 24, 25.
dead.

Expos. 43. The commandment of God, Iam. 5. 16. Ephesians. 6. 18. Col. 4. 3. Romans
15. 30. our love to our brother* who is of our flesh, and may appertain to the
kingdom of grace, Romans 10. 1. 1. Io. 5. 16. does require that we pray for all
sorts of men living, both private, Iam. 5. 14. 1. Sam. 12. 25. and public
persons, 1. King 1. 36, 37. Esr. 6. 10. friend, Job. 42. 8. 10. and foe, Psalm.
35. 13. near in blood, Numb. 12. 13. Genesis 25. 21. and 17. 18. and 27, 28. and
28. 3. 1. Chro. 29. 19. and stranger, Col. 1. 9. weak or strong Christians, 1.
These. 5. 14. Col. 4. 12. 2. Cor. 1. 11. Heb. 13. 18, 19. such as stand, 2 Thessalonians. 3. 5. or be gone astray, Cant. 8. 8. Ex. 32. 31, 32. Romans 10. 1. All
need the prayers one of another, Iam. ^. 16. Satan seeks to molest and
trouble all men, Luke 22. 31. Job. 1. 9, 10. Ephesians. 6. 12. 1. Pet. 5. 8. the fall
of any man is a dishonor to God, Romans 2. 23, 24. a sinners conversion brings
glory to his name, Apo. 16. 9. Mal. 2. 1, 2. the prayer of the weakest
Christian is available with God, Psalm. 65. 2. and 145. 18. Psalm. 102. 17. at
least it shall return into his own bosom, Psalm. 35. 13. Ezekiel. 14. 14. it is
a special act of love, Matthew. 5. 44. a means to reconcile our enemies unto us,
Romans 12. 20. or to prevent danger, or hurt, that otherwise we might receive
from him, Psalm. 109. 4.

44. Prayers cannot avail the dead, Reu. 14. 13. 1. Pet. 3. 19. Heb. 9. 27.
neither can a prayer for them be a work of faith: for commandment to do it,
promise of good to come by it, or approved example to warrant it in Scripture,
there is not any. Superstition did first hatch these prayers, and superstition
now is the foundation of them. Love is the pretense which the ignorant sort
make to defend them, but indeed they are vain, ignorant, rash, and
uncharitable.

Q. May men content themselves to pray in private only, or only in public?
A. No, but 4^ they must Act. 2. 42.
use both public and Luke 11. 1.
private 46 prayer,

Expos. 45. Public prayer, is that which is used in the public meetings and
assemblies of Gods feruants. This is a principal part of Gods worship, Act. 3.
1. acceptable unto his majesty, because we acknowledge him openly to be the
giver of every good gift, and speak of his free favors, to the praise of his
grace, Psalm. 22. 25. and 40. 10. ever used in the house of God, Mat. 21. 13.
sanctifying every other duty, 1. Tim. 4. 5. commanded by Christ, who has
promised his presence in a special manner in the congregation, Psalm. 27. 4.
Matthew. 18. 20. Also hereby we are quickened to pray more fervently, Zach. 8.
20, 21, 22. do testify our faith, hope, thankfulness, profess our selves to
be the servants of Christ, and stir up others by our example, Psalm. 95. 6.
and 96. 1, 2, 7, 8. And it is much to our comfort, that what we ask, is
approved, and sought with common consent, public service being of more
worth then private, as a society exceeds the worthiness of one man, Psa. 29.
9. and 87. 2. and 35. 18. and 111. 1.

46. Private prayer, is that which is performed in a family, or by one alone.
Zach. 12. 12, 13, 14. In the family prayer is necessary, God by his
commandment binding parents and masters to see it performed, Josh. 24. 15.
Genesis 18* 18. the faithful have followed the Lords dir^ction herein, Job. 1. 5.
hereby the affairs of the whole family are sanctified, 1. Chro. 16. 43. Psalm.
127. 1. 1. Tim. 4. 5. and God will power down a blessing upon that family,
that jointly seeks his favor by hearty supplication, Act. 1. 14. 15. and 12.
5. 6. Alone we must pray, Genesis 24. 63. and 32. 9. 10. Luke 11. 1. Matthew. 6. 6.
that we may be more fit to join with others to our edification, and have
comfort when we are alone. Psalm. 30. 10. 11. 12. Also we have private sins to
confess, wants to bewail, crosses under which we should be humbled, Psalm. 6.
2. 3. 6. 7. Matthew. 14. 31. and favors for which we should be thankful. Lam.
3. 23. Psa. 71. 23, 24. and 66. 19. 20.

Q. What other means has the Lord appointed to increase faith?
A. The due Genesis 17. 9, 10, 11. Romans 4. 11.
administration, and receiving of the 1 Sacraments.

Expos. 1. This word Sacrament did in ancient times signify an oath, whereby
soldiers both bound themselves to be true to their captain, and the general
in like manner did bind himself to the soldiers; but now it is used to
signify the seals of the covenant, whereby the Lord does bind himself in
Christ Jesus to be merciful to us, and we bind our selves to be true unto
Christ. The Sacraments are special means to confirm faith, because Christ is
after a special manner represented and offered unto all, and effectually
bestowed upon every worthy communicant.

Q. Who ought to administer the Sacraments?
A. Only they that Heb. 5. 4.
are 2 lawfully called thereunto by the Church.

Expos. 2. Such are lawfully called to administer the Sacraments, who being
furnished with the gifts of knowledge, and holiness, are set apart for that
office by the Church, Deuteronomy. 33. 10. Mal. 2. 7. Mat. 5. 14, 15, 16. 1. Tim. 3.
2. 4, 5, 6, 7. Tit. 1. 7, 8, 9. Matthew. 24. 45. Romans 1. 1. Tit. 1. 5.

Q. What is a Sacrament?
A. A seal 3 of Romans 4. 11.
the covenant 4 of grace.

Expos. 3. Sacraments are appointed not only to help the understanding, and
the memory, but also to persuade, and assure the heart that Christ is ours.

4. That covenant is sealed in the Sacrament, which God of his mere grace, and
favor, made with us in Jesus Christ, being miserable sinners, Genesis 17. 7. 9.
10. 11. etc.

Q. In what words is this covenant expressed in Scripture?
A. I will be 5 thy Ier. 31. 33.
God, and thou shall be my people.

Expos. 5. In this covenant, God does promise to be our Savior, King, and
Father, to pardon our sin, sanctify our nature, bestow all good things upon
us, and protect us from evil, Genesis 17. 1. 2. Leu. 26. 11. 12. 2. Cor. 6. 16,
17, 18. Heb. 8. 10. 11. 12. we promise to choose God to be our God, trust on
him, love* and fear him, and walk in obedience before him, Ex. 15. 2. and 19.
18. and 24. 3. 7.

Q. What are the parts of a Sacrament?
A. Two: an 6 outward visible sign, sanctified 7 to represent and seal
another thing to the mind and heart; and an inward 8 grace, which is the thing
signified.

Expos. 6. Of a sign there must needs be two parts, the understanding thereby
conceiving one thing, and the sense another: Genesis 9. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17. Esa. 38. 7, 8. therefore of a Sacrament there must needs be two parts, one
inward, another outward.

7. A siigne sanctified, is that which is appointed by the Lord himself to
sigfie, Exodus 40. 11. 13. and not by man upon any conceited analogy or
proportion.

8. The inward grace, is the free and spiritual gift, which God bestows upon
the soul, Genesis 17. 7. Matthew. 26. 28.

Q. Who is the Author of the Sacraments?
A. The Lord Esa. 7. 14. and 38. 7.
only 9 who made the covenant.

Expos. 9. God is the only Lawgiver of his Church, Iam. 4. 12. Matthew. 23. 8.
10. Act. 3. 22. to teach it by word and sign. And as to forgive sins, and
receive unto grace is proper to the Lord alone, Mic. 7. 18. Hos. 14. 1, 2. so
it is his peculiar to institute a sign and seal for the confirmation thereof.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?
A. In 10 the New Testament only two: Io. 1. 26.
Baptism, and the Lords Luke 22. 19. 20.
supper.

Expos. 10. In the old Testament the Jews had many Sacraments, some ordinary,
Genesis 17. 9. 11. 12. etc. Exodus 12. 1. 2. 3. etc. some extraordinary, 1. Cor.
10. 1. 2. 3. 4. but the New Testament has only two. For there be no more
Sacraments of the new Testament then Christ did institute, and receive before
his death, because it was necessary that he should receive both, to sanctify
them in his own person, and to seal that communion which is between him and
us. The nature of a Sacrament agrees not to the five forged Sacraments of the
Papists; either they are not proper to Church, or are not instituted of God, or
consist not of an outward visible sign, and an inward grace: the covenant of
grace is sealed in any of them. These Sacraments of the New Testament are
perpetual and never to be abrogated, Heb. 8. 13.

Q. What is Baptism?
A. A 12 Sacrament Matt. 28. 19. Act. 8. 38.
of our ingrafting into Christ, communion with him, and entrance into the
Church.

Expos. 12. The seed of Abraham, Gal. 3. 7. or children of Christian Parents,
are within the covenant, are Christians and members of the Church, 1. Cor. 7.
14. Romans 11. 16. Baptism therefore does not make them Christian souls, but
does solemnly signify, and seal their ingrafting into Christ, and that
communion which the members of Christ have with him their Head, and does
confirm that they are acknowledged members of the Church, and entered into it.
1. Pet. 3. 21.

Q. What is the outward sign?
A. Water Act. 10. 47.
, wherewith the party baptized is Matthew. 3. 6. 11. 13. 16. Act. 16. 15.
washed, by dipping or sprinkling Matthew. 28. 19.
into the 12 name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost.

Expos. 12. To be baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost,
is to be consecrated unto the worship and service of the Father, Son, and
holy Ghost.

Q. What is the inward grace or thing signified?
A. Forgiveness Mark. 1. 4. Act. 2. 38.
of 13 sins, and Tit. 3. 5.
sanctification.

Expos. 13. Water in Baptism does signify both Christ's blood, by which all
our sins are washed away, and Christ's spirit, by which we are regenerated,
Romans 6. 3. Matthew. 3. 11. Ioh. 1. 26. Col. 2. 12. wherefore the inward grace in
Baptism, is the pardon of our sins, and renewing of our nature. Tit. 3. 5.

Q. To what condition does the party baptized bind himself?
A. To believe Act. 8. 37.
in 14 Christ, and Matthew. 3. 12.
to forsake his sin.

Expos. 14. Gods promise to us, and our promise to God employed in the Covenant,
is sealed in Baptism, Act. 16. 14, 15. 31, 32, 33. so that we bind our selves
thereby, to the performance of our duty. Infants baptized have not the use of
reason, much less faith to believe; but yet as they be in the covenant, so
they do oblige themselves to believe in Christ, and depart from iniquity;
which they are bound to perform when they come to years of discretion, Act.
2. 39. with 2. Cor. 6. 17, 18.

Q. How often need a man to be baptized?
A. It is enough 15 once to be Act. 7. 8.
baptized: for baptism is a pledge of our Tit. 3. 5.
new birth,

Expos. 15. We never read that Christ or his Apostles did administer Baptism
more then once, to one man. And Circumcision, the seal of entrance into the
Church of the Jews, in the place whereof Baptism is come, was only once
applied by Gods appointment. Genesis 17. 23, 24, etc.

Q. Who ought to be baptized?
A. Infidels Act. 8. 12.
converted to 16 the faith; and 17 infants, Act. 2. 39. 1. Cor. 7. 14.
of one or both Christian 18 parents.

Expos. 16. All they who be within the covenant, and such only are to be
received into Baptism.

17. Infants of Christian parents are within the covenant; to them appertains
the promise of forgiveness of sins, and the Kingdom of God. Also
Circumcision amongst the Jews, which answers to our Baptism, was
administered to Infants, Genesis 17. 12. and 21. 4. Luke 1. 59. and 2. 21. And when
the faithful which the Scripture says, were converted with their whole
household were baptized, it may probably be thought there were some children
amongst them of those households, who were not excluded. Act. 16. 14, 15.

18. Though we acknowledge such only to be sincere Christians, who serve God
with upright hearts, Romans 2. 28, 29. yet those are not denied to be Christians,
who make so much as a general profession of Christ. Act. 11. 26. 1. Cor. 1, 2.
with 5. 1, 2, 3. and 15. 12.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?
A. A 1. Cor. 10. 16.
Sacrament of our continuance and growth in Christ.

Expos. 1. Christ is given to be spiritual nourishment unto the soul, that
we might grow and increase in him, Ioh. 6. 33. 48, 50, 51, 53, 54, 56. as
plants are not only grafted, but do grow in the stock: and this is sealed
in this Sacrament.

Q. Who is the author of this Sacrament?
A. The Lord 1. Cor. 11. 23, 24.
Jesus 2 in the same night ^ that he was betrayed.

Expos. 2. Christ who is the Lord and head of his Church, Act. 10. 36. Ephesians.
1. 22. Col. 1. 18. having authority to institute Sacraments, Matthew. 28. 18,
19. and power effectually to perform whatsoever is signified and sealed
therein, Ioh. 1. 4. Ephesians. 5. 14. did in his own person institute and ordain it.

3. When Christ was preparing himself to the greatest work of love that ever
was, having his thoughts wholly bent to procure the eternal good of his Elect,
then did he out of his infinite love, even in the same night that he was to be
betrayed, appoint this holy Sacrament; knowing that the institution and sealing
of the Testament, ought to go before the death of the Testator. This should
stir us up with care and reverence, to receive this pledge of Christ's love,
and to come unto it as unto a spiritual feast, being persuaded that Christ
will respect us now he is glorified, seeing he did not forget us in his agony
and passion.

Q. What is the outward sign?
A. Bread 4 and Mat. 26. 27, 28.
wine, with the actions pertaining to them, as 5 breaking, giving, receiving,
eating, and drinking.

Expos. 4. Besides that bread and wine are most usual, fit, and necessary
nourishments, Psalm. 104. 15. they do of all other best serve to express the
body and blood of Christ, Io. 6. 33. Leauened or unleavened bread are of free
use, Act. 20. 7. Matthew. 26. 17. 26. but it is expedient, that it be bread that
has substance in it. The use of the wafer cake is justly blamed as
superstitious by our Church. And because the Sacrament is a spiritual feast,
therefore the finest bread, and pure wine, is of most laudable use. Out of
niggardlines to mix water with wine, sauoureth of an ill mind, Malac. 1. 7.
8. Christ being not only the true, but the sufficient nourishment of the
soul, intending to give us a full meal, appointed both bread and wine, and
that severally to be used in the Lords Supper, 1. Cor. 11. 23, 24. So that it
is sacrilege to deliver this Sacrament in one kind only, and presumption not
to administer them severally, seeing Christ intended to set forth his violent
death, wherein his body and blood were separated.

5. The bread is to be broken according to the example of Christ and his
Apostles, because this Sacrament was appointed specially to represent the death
and passion of our Savior Christ, in which his body was crucified, and his
blood shed, Matthew. 26. 26, 27, 28. Act. 20. 7.

Q. What is the inward grace?
A. Christ 1. Cor. 11. 24.
with all 6 the benefits of 7 his death and passion.

Expos. 6. Not only Christ his benefits, but even Christ himself is offered
unto us; for we cannot be partakers of the benefits of Christ, unless we be
united unto him. Io. 15. 2. Ephesians. 4. 16. Col. 2. 19. Christ is truly and
spiritually present in the Sacrament, exhibited to the says of every worthy
receiver, but not corporally united to the bread and wine in respect of place.
Act. 3. 21. with Mat. 28. 6. Ioh. 16. 18.

7. The bread signifies the body of Christ, the wine betokens his blood; the
breaking of the bread sets forth the crucifying of Christ, etc.

Q. What is the duty of the Minister in the administration of the Sacrament?
A. To 1. Cor. 11. 23. 24. Matthew. 26. 26, 27, 28. Mark. 14. 22. Luke 22. 19.
consecrate 8 it by 9 declaring the institution thereof, and 10 prayer, joined
with thanksgiving 11: as also to break the bread, and afterward to deliver the
bread and wine to the people of God.

8. To consecrate, is to set apart the bread and wine unto an holy use. 1. Tim.
4. 5. Ex. 13. 2. and 22. 29.

9. If Christ had not instituted this use of bread and wine, it could never
have had the being, efficacy, and virtue of a Sacrament; therefore the
institution ought to be declared.

10. God is ever ready pressed to bestow a blessing upon his ordinances, Mal. 3.
10. Psa. 81. 13. but yet looks to be sought unto, Ioh. 4. 10. Act. 6. 2. 4.
and 4. 31. therefore the Minister must crave Gods blessing to sanctify the
bread and wine to their right ends.

11. The work of our Redemption being lively set forth in this Sacrament;
praise to God for that benefit ought not to be omitted, Reu. 5. 9. Psa. 103. 4.
Reu. 1. 5. 6. Zach. 9. 9.

Q. What is hereby signified?
A. The action of God the Father, offering Christ to all, and bestowing him 1.
Cor. 10. 16.
effectually upon the worthy receiver.

Q. What is the duty of the receivers?
A. To Matthew. 26. 26, 27. 1. Cor. 11. 23, 24.
receive 12 the bread and wine delivered, and to 13 eat and drink thereof.

Expos. 12. It is most expedient, to receive the bread and cup into the hand,
and not superstitiously, or unseemly to have the bread put, or the wine powered
into the mouth. Matthew. 26. 26. 1. Cor. 14. 40.

13. Eating imports more then to suffer a thing to melt in the mouth; for
common bread fit for nourishment which should be used, should by chewing, etc.
be prepared for the stomach.

Q. What is signified he rehy?
A. Our 1. Cor. 10. 16.
receiving and feeding upon Christ by faith.

Q. Is it sufficient to receive this Sacrament once?
A. No: but Act. 2. 42. and 20. 7.
we must receive it 14 often.

Expos. 14. Christ's commandment, 1. Cor. 11. 26. the Apostles practice, Act.
20. 7. our own necessity, weakness of faith, 1. Sam. 27. 1. Mar. 16. 14.
dullness of understanding, Io. 20. 9. Mar. 8. 17. 18. forgetfulness, Luke 24.
6. and spiritual wants and decays in grace, Mat. 24. 12. Reu. 2. 4. and 3. 2.
do require that we receive this Sacrament often, Reu. 3. 2. 3. We must receive
it as often, as it is administered in that Congregation where we live, unless
we be justly hindered; or companies in great parishes be sorted for several
days, because they cannot commmunicate all at once, Numb. 9. 13. 2. Chro. 30.
12. Act. 2. 42. Mat. 22. 5. 6. 1. Cor. 10. 16.

Q For what end and use ought we to receive this Sacrament?
A. To 1. Cor. 10. 16.
consirme our 15 faith, communion with Christ, and all saving graces in us, to
keep 16 in 1. Cor. 11. 24. 26.
remembrance the Lords death until he come again, and to testify 1. Cor. 12.
13.
our love one unto another.

Expos. 15. The increase of faith, and of communion with Christ, infer
necessarily an increase of all graces which spring thence as from the root.
Io. 15. 4. Ephesians. 2. 21. 22. Io. 7. 37.

16. This stirs up to a more serious thinking on Christ's love and goodness in
his death, and so preserues the same more truly in memory. And by eating this
bread, and drinking this wine men do profess, and after a sort preach unto
others, unto the worlds end, the my sterie of the Gospel; the sum and
substance whereof consists in the death of Jesus Christ, and the fruits that
flow therefrom, shadowed in the Sacrament.

Q. What is the danger of unworthy receiving?
A. Unworthy 1. Cor. 11. 27. 29.
receivers 17 are guilty of the 18 body and blood of the Lord, and do eat
and drink judgment to themselves.

Expo. 17. Unworthy receivers are such who eat and drink unworthily, that is,
who receive the bread and wine without due reverence and respect to the
mystery contained in them. 2. Sam. 6. 6. 1. Sam. 6. 19. 2. Chro. 30. 20. or to
the holy ends why they were ordained, or to the person by whose authority
they were appointed. 1. Sam. 2. 29. with Reu. 3. 4. Luke 3. 8.

18. To be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, is to offer a special
wrong and injury to the person of Christ, and his sufferings, and in a
special manner to sin against the work of our redemption, which is fully
set forth in the Lords supper.

Q. Who are to receive this Sacrament?
A. Such as know 19 their misery Matthew. 11. 28.
by sin, the remedy thereof in Christ, and Exodus 12. 26. 27.
the ^^ doctrine of the Sacrament; withal earnestly Reu. 22. 17.
longing 21 to be satisfied with the bread of life.

Expos. 19. Christ's death is signified by the Sacrament, and Christ with all
the benefits of his death and passion is offered herein: unless we know
Christ, our misery without him, and the exceeding benefits of his death, we
can never desire, Io. 4. 10. or rejoice in thanksgiving for that mercy. Romans
7. 25. Ephesians. 2. 1. 4. and 5. 8. 1. Tim. 1. 13, 14.

20. This Sacrament is a sign and seal: therefore before we can use it well,
or prepare to receive; or examine our selves how we receive, 1. Cor. 11. 28. we
must have understanding. Exodus 12. 26, 27. Josh. 4. 6. 2. Chro. 30. 22.

21. The thirsty who are ever lowly, are the only welcome guests unto the
Lords table, Ioh. 7. 37. Reu. 22. 15. This desire is stirred up in us by a
consideration of the necessity of the Sacrament, our own want thereof, Math.
9. 12. the benefits bestowed therein, Ps. 63. 1, 2, 3. P^. 4. 7. and the helps
we have thereby to quicken and confirm our faith.

Q. What else is required in them that come to this holy Table?
A. Renewed 22 hatred of all Luke 3. 12, 13.
sin, an hearty endeavor Matthew. 18. 3.
to overcome natural passions, and an utter and well advised Luke 14. 28, 29.
etc.
forsaking of gross sin, willingness to Mat. 5. 6.
be strengthened in 23 faith, and a longing Mar. 11. 25. Mat. 5. 23, 24.
desire for 24 the good of our brethren.

Expos. 22. He that loves sin, cannot truly thirst after Christ, Matthew. 11.
28. believe in God, Mar. 1. 15. Act. 15. 9. 1. Ioh. 3. 3. 2. Cor. 15. 17. or
have communion with him, 2. Cor. 6. 14. Psa. 5. 4. Amos 3. 3. 1. Ioh. 1. 6.
Sin is of a soyling nature, and does defile Gods ordinances unto us, Tit. 1.
15. Hag. 2. 13, 14. Heb. 10. 22. Numb. 9. 6. 2. Chr. 23. 19. It suffices not
that we hate all sin, but this must be renewed by labor and care, Matthew.
18. 3. Genesis 35. 2. Amos. 4. 12. Luke 3. 12, 13, 14. to see more thoroughly the
vileness and multitude of our particular sins, Reu. 3. 2, 3. Ier. 3. 13.
purge the heart of them, by judging and condemning, Iam. 4. 8, 9. etc. and
quicken the loathing of them in the heart, so that the very thought of them
may be bitter. Ier. 31. 19. 2. Tim. 1. 6.

23. We should desire to have our faith increased before we come to the Lords
table: for faith was required of such who did desire to be baptized, Act. 8.
37. and 16. 33. 34. It is the eye by which we discern, 2. Cor. 3. 18. Ioh. 3.
14, 15. and 8. 56. and the hand by which we receive Christ, Ioh. 1. 12. and 6.
35. making this feast of the Lord exceeding sweet. Psalm. 119. 103.

24. When we come to the Lords table, we profess our selves to be children of
the same Father, 2. Cor. 6. 18. the redeemed of the same Lord, 1. Cor. 8. 6.
such as be guided by the same spirit, 1. Cor. 12. 13. ruled by the same word,
fed at the same table, 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. members of the same body, Ephesians. 4. 4,
5, 6. and heirs of the same kingdom, Romans 8. 14. 17. should we not then
heartily desire the good of one another, both in soul and body? Ephesians. 4. 3. 1.
Pet. 3. 8.

Q. What if a man find himself weak in faith, and full of doubting?
A. He must bewail Mark. 9. 24.
his 25 unbelief, pray for faith, seek to have his doubts resolved, and so
receive to be further strengthened 26 in Judge. 6. 37, 38. Exodus 12. 1, 2, 3, 4.
believing.

Expos. 25. Unbelief hinders the sweetness of the Lords ordinances, Ioh. 6.
54. 63. 64. godly sorrow for it quickens a desire, and makes way for the
increase of faith, 2. Cor. 7. 10. wherefore doubtings are to be bewailed, but
we must not thereby be kept from feasting with Christ.

26. The weak were admitted by Christ unto this table: Mat. 26. 26. with 26.
56. Mark. 16. 14. Act. 1. 6. The Sacrament was ordained not only for the
strong man, but even for babes in Christ, that they might wax stronger, Romans
4. 11. 1. Cor. 3. 2, 3. they may therefore approach unto this banquet, being
invited by the Master of the feast. Pro. 9. 6. Mat. 22. 9. Luke 14. 21, 22.

Q. How ought a man's heart to be affected in receiving the Sacrament?
A. With Exodus 3. 5. Genesis 28. 17.
reverence, Deuteronomy. 16. 15.
joy, and ^7 comfort, 1. Cor. 11. 25.
meditating on the outward signs, and what they signify; the dainties
prepared, and love of him that prepared them, our communion with Christ, his
graces, and faithful people; whereby the heart is 1. Kin. 8. 66.
stirred up to thanksgiving.

Expos. 27. From that which we noted before touching the actions of the
minister, and the people in the delivery and receiving of this Sacrament, we
may learn how we ought to behave our selves in this holy business. Exercise
the eye in seeing the elements, and the actions belonging thereunto, Exo. 24.
8. the ear in hearing the mysteries explained; the hand in receiving the
elements, and the taste in feeling the comfort of them; exercise also the mind
in meditating and remembering of Christ's sufferings, and the love of God, not
only giving his Son to die for us, Ioh. 3. 16. but offering and sealing unto
us our redemption thereby, and stir up the heart to receive Christ, Esa. 64.
7. and mourn for sin, Zach. 12. 10. desire Gods favor, rejoice in his love,
Neh. 8. 10. stand in awe before him, Psa. 5. 7. fearing after an holy manner,
least by any unruly affections, or unfitting gesture, we show the least want of
due esteem, and joy in his presence. Ps. 2. 11. and 4. 4. 1. Cor. 11. 10. and
14. 40.

Q. What must we do after we have received?
A. We must 28 endeavor to find an Prou. 4. 18. Ezeck. 47. 12.
increase of faith, love, and all saving graces, abounding more and more in
well-doing.

Expos. 28. The receiving of the Lords Supper, is a renewing of our covenant
with God, Exodus 13. 9. Genes. 17. 11. 2. Chron. 30. 29. therein we feed
spiritually upon Christ, 1. Cor. 10. 16. are refreshed by him, and by faith
draw virtue from him, Romans 8. 2. Phil. 4. 13. therefore after we have received,
we must grow more in grace and knowledge. If we speed not well after we have
received, commonly our want of preparation was the cause thereof, or defects
willingly admitted in the act of receiving, 2. Chro. 30. 19, 20. Judge. 10. 14,
15. But care must be taken, that out of dislike of our selves, we do not
dislike or deny that measure of grace which the Lord bestows upon us; neither
must we be ouer-hastie; the Lord does not always power his gifts upon us, the
same day that we come unto him in his holy ordinances. Psa. 97. 11. Cant. 3. 4.
and 5. 6.

Q. What order has the Lord left in his Church to keep his ordinances from
contempt?
A. The unruly 29 should 30 be 1. These. 5. 14.
admonished, the 31 obstinate 1. Cor. 5. 5.
excommunicated 32, and the penitent after their fall 33 restored and 2. Cor.
2. 6, 7.
comforted.

Expos. 29. They are unruly, who are inordinate, live dissolutely, and such who
are known by speech, gestures, and deeds not to walk according to the rule
of the word, or busi-bodies, vain boasters, idle, etc. 2. These. 3. 11, 12. or
be fallen into any outward sin. 1. Cor. 6. 9.

30. Such persons being members of the Church, 1. Cor. 5. 11. 12. should be
reprehended for their sin certainly known both to be sin, and to be
committed by them. Leu. 19. 17. Admonition must be performed with meekenes and
discretion. Gal. 6. 1, 2. 2. Tim. 2. 25. sometimes also with zeal and
severity. 1. Gor. 4. 21. Gal. 3. 1. fitted to the person sinning, the sin
committed, and the manner of doing. Numb. 12. 9. 10. 14. If the sin be
private known to few, the admonition must be private. Matthew. 18 15. Luke 17.
3. if known to part of the Church, admonition must be before them that know
it: if known to the whole church, the admonition must be public. 1. Tim. 5.
20. unless it be known by their fault, that have published it without cause.
But always respect is to be had, to the condition of the party offending. 1.
These. 5. 14. and that must be done which tends most to the edification of the
Church. 1. Cor. 14. 26. If admonition at the first prevail not, then it is to
be doubled, until either the offender be reformed, or declare his obstinacy,
Tit. 2. 10. 11.

31. Such are to be held obstinate, who despise the Churches admonition, and
will by no means be reclaimed from their sin, notwithstanding the long
suffering which the Church has used toward them. Matthew. 18. 17. Tit. 2. 10,
11. 2. Tim. 2. 25.

32. To be excommunicated, is to be debarred from the public ordinances of
God, and society of the faithful, both public and private. 1. Cor. 5. 3. 11.
12. 1. Tim. 1. 20. 2. These. 3. 6. 14. so far as necessity will permit either
in respect of their general, or particular calling. 1. Cor. 7. 20. and 7. 10,
11, 12. with Ephesians. 5. 31. The end of these censures is the humbling and
reforming of the sinner. 1. Cor. 5. 5. 2. These. 3. 14. the terrifying of
others. 1. Tim. 5. 20. and keeping the ordinances of God in reverence. 1. Cor.
5. 6, 7.

33. The censures of the Church, are medicines to cure, not poisons to destroy,
inflicted for to humble, and bring into the right way, such as have gone
astray: when the sinner does truly lament the evil of his life, and is
unfeignedly sorrowful, he is to be received again into the bosom of the
Church, and comforted, least Satan by his devises should bring him to
despair. 2. Cor. 2. 10. 11. 1. These. 5. 14.

Q. Besides the forenamed means, are there not some other profitable for the
increase of faith?
A. Yes: Reu. 1. 3.
reading, 1 or 2 hearing the Scriptures read in Act. 13. 15.
public, and Act. 8. 13.
in 3 private 4 meditation Luke 2. 51.
and Heb. 3. 13.
conference 5.

Expos. 1. The reading, or hearing of the scripture read, does furnish the mind
more with knowledge. 1. Pet. 1. 19. Pro. 1. 5. Deuteronomy. 11. 19. 20. and does work
upon the affection. Deuteronomy. 17. 18, 19. 2. Kin. 22. 11. 19. Psalm. 119. 93.
especially if we apply the commandments for our direction, the threatenings to
fear us from sin, or to humble us for it. 2. Chro. 34. 19. 27. and the
promises for our comfort and encouragement.

2. As God requires that the Scriptures should be read in public. 1. These. 5.
27. Col. 4. 16. so thereby he has promised, that his people may learn to
fear him. Deuteronomy. 31. 12, 13.

3. Private reading makes the public ministry more profitable. Act. 8. 30.
31. inableth us better to judge of the Doctrines taught. Act. 17. 11. thereby
we are better fitted for the combat. 1. Tim. 4. 13. 15. and many evils are
prevented. Esa. 8. 19. 20. Psalm. 119. 9. Job. 22. 21.

4. Meditation is available for the getting of grounded and settled knowledge.
2. Tim. 2. 7. Psalm. 119. 99. and the increase thereof. 1. Tim. 4. 13, 15. it
strengthens memory. Psalm. 119. 15. 16. enlarges our delight in good. Psalm.
104. 34. Psalm. 119. 16. discovers corruption, purges the heart of idle, and
unprofitable wanderings, adds life and strength to holy duties. Genesis 24. 63.
Psalm. 143. 5. 6. and hereby we grow more inwardly acquainted with God. Psalm.
77. 10. 11. 12. this duty must be practiced every day more or less. Psalm.
119. 97.

5. All such who with wisdom, Pro. 10. 32. and 15. 22. Psalm. 37. 30.
reverence, 1. Pet. 4. 11. love, the spirit of meekness and gentleness, Tit.
3. 2. Col. 4. 6. Ph. 2. 2. 3. and a desire of reaping good, do confer
religiously, shall prevent rotten speeches. Ephesians. 4. 29. hardness of heart.
Heb. 3. 13. and much evil. Eccl. 5. 2. shall increase in knowledge. Pro. 1. 5.
be resolved of their doubts. Col. 3. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 11. Job. 16. 4. 5. armed
against falling. Act. 11. 23. Jude. 20. Pro. 18. 8. and quickened from their
dullness. Heb. 10. 2. This will kindle desire of more fellowship with Christ.
Cant. 5. 16. and sweeten the communion of Saints. Romans 1. 11. 12. 1 Thessalonians. 3.
2. Romans 15. 32. 24. v. These duties must carefully be practiced of every man,
as he has opportunity and means. Matthew. 25. 27. 2. Cor. 8. 12.

Q. Hitherto of the ordinary means whereby faith is increased: be there not
also some 6 extraordinary means?
A. Yes: and these be holy Luke 5. 53.
fasting, holy Est. 9. 17.
feasting, and religious Psalm. 50. 14.
vows.

6. By extraordinare duties, are meant such which be of more seldom and rare
practice, though they must be used often a^ God gives occasion, and when he
calls thereunto.

Q. What is an holy fast?
A. A religious Hest. 4. 16.
abstinence from all Leu. 23. 28.
the labors of our 7 calling, and Exodus 33. 5.
comforts of this life, so far as comelines and necessity will permit; that we
might be more seriously Dan. 9. 9. 11. Leu. 23. 27.
humbled 9 before God, and more fervent in prayer.

Expos. 7. A fast is to be kept as a Sabbath unto God. Leu. 23. 28. Esa. 58.
13, 14. And therefore as upon the Sabbath, such businesses of this life must
be avoided, that agree not with the Sabbath.

8. By the comforts of this life, we are to understand, meat, drink, costly
apparel, recreation, and all other delights. Dan. 10. 3. 1. Cor. 7. 5.

9. With fasting must be joined a serious meditation of our sins. Esr. 6. 4.
6. Neh. 1. 6. 7. Gods judgments, Neh. 9. 35. 36, 37. and our special wants.
Dan. 9. 11. 18. The person meet for this exercise must be no nouice in
religion. Luke 5. 36. 37. Matthew. 9. 15, 16. A fast is either of one alone, 2.
Sam. 12. 16. or of the whole family, Zac. 12. 12. or of a particular
congregation, or of the whole Church in general. Judge. 20. 28.

Q. When ought we to fast?
A. When we feel or Hest. 4. 16. Esr. 8. 21.
fear some grievous 10 calamity upon us, or hanging over 11 our heads, want
some special 12 blessing, are pressed with some special sin, or go about
some weighty Act. 13. 2.
matter.

Expos. 10. As sword, famine, pestilence, strange unwonted sicknesses,
unseasonable weather, etc. Ezekiel. 14. 21. with Esa. 22. 12. 13.

11. These judgments hang over our heads, which our sins, and the sins of
the land have deserved, and cry for. Amos. 8. 5. 8. Iam. 5. 4. Genes. 18. 20.
and which God has threatened by his word and ministry, Zeph. 1. 3, 4, 5. with
Zach. 1. 6. Lam. 1. 13, 14. 20. with 2. 17. and has inflicted formerly upon
like transgressors. Ier. 7. 12. Amos 6. 2, 3

12. Notwithstanding the ordinary and daily prayers of his people, the Lord in
great wisdom, will see them want some special good thing, that they may
seek him more earnestly in the use of the duty of fasting. Judge. 20. 28.

Q. What is an holy feast?
A. An 13 extraordinary 1. Chron. 16. 8. and 29. 10, 11.
thanksgiving for some notable deliverance, out of some desperate danger;
testified 14 with feasting before God, with joy and gladness, sending presents
to our friends, and Neh. 8. 19. Hest. 9. 22.
portions to the needy.

Expos. 13. In a day of extraordinary thanksgiving, there should be a serious
remembrance of Gods benefits, Ps. 116. 6. and 103. 2. whereby we should be
stirred up after a fervent manner, to yield praise to the Lord, Psa. 34. 3. and
35. 27. Exodus 15. 2. and rejoice before him heartily, Deuteronomy. 12. 12. tying our
selves unto him by renewing our covenant, Ion. 2. 9. Deuteronomy. 29. 3. 10, 11, 12,
13. 2. Chron. 15. 11. 12. and learning to be more confident in him, having
experience of his great goodness. Psalm. 3. 5, 6. and 52. 9.

14. On the day of thanksgiving, we may have a more liberal use of Gods
creatures, both in meat and apparel, then is ordinary, Neh. 8. 10. Hest. 9.
22. But this must be used in moderation and sobriety, that men may be better
fitted for the exercises of religion, 1. Kin. 8. 65. This exercise, if it be
public, must be joined with the preaching of the word: if private, with the
reading of the Scripture, or some holy exhortation, for the better stirring up
of affection.

Q. What is a religious vow?
A. A solemn Deuteronomy. 23. 21, 22. Prou. 20. 15.
promise unto God, made by a 15 fit person, of some 16 lawful thing, which 17
is in his choice, to testify his love 18 and thankefulnes.

15. Such persons are fit to vow, who have knowledge, judgment, and ability to
discern of a vow, and of the duties belonging to the performance of the same.
Eccl. 5. 2.

16. A man may not vow an unlawful, vile, or superstitious thing: Deuteronomy. 23.
18. for we are obliged to avoid all evil, yea all appearance of evil, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 22. It is presumption and rashness to vow that to God, which he
has forbidden, and will not accept. Judge. 11. 30, 31.

17. What we are not able to perform, either by reason of the common frailty of
all men, Eccl. 5. 5. with 1. Cor. 7. 7. or of our subjection unto others, as
the wife, child, servant, may not vow, without the liberty of their superiors,
Number. 30. 3, 4. 6, 7, 8. 12. That thing is not to be held in our free choice,
which we are necessarily bound unto before our vow, Leu. 27. 26. Deuteronomy. 23. 22,
23. But yet to quicken and stir us up the better to the performance of our
duty, it is lawful to renew the covenant and vow which we made unto the Lord
in Baptism, Psalm. 119. 106. To God, vows were commonly made with prayers,
Genesis 28. 20. Psalm. 61. 5. and paid with thanksgiving, Psalm. 65. 1. and 66. 13,
14. and 116. 14. Ion. 2. 9.

18. Vows should be performed speedily, Eccl. 5. 5. Deuteronomy. 23. 23. Psa. 76. 11.
I vow rashly, the rashness is to be repented of, the vow otherwise lawful is
to be performed; but a vow should not in any wise be the bond of iniquity.
Mat. 15. 5, 6. 1. Sam. 25. 22. 39. Act. 23. 21.

Q. Can faith being wrought and confirmed in us, be fruitles and unprofitable?
A. No: 19 for it Gal. 5. 6.
works by love.

Expos. 19. By faith we are knit unto Christ, Romans 11. 19, 20. Ephesians. 3. 17. and
cannot be utterly fruitless, Io. 15. 5. seeing we receive the sap of grace
from him. Io. 1. 16. Col. 1. 19.

Q. What is the principal work of faith?
A. It 20 purifieth Act. 15. 9.
the heart.

Expos. 20. To purify the heart is to abate and crucify the power of sin in
the believers, and by little and little to renew them in holiness and
righteousness, Gal. 5. 24. and 6. 14. The Spirit of God is the author of
sanctification, Io. 3. 5. 1. Cor. 6. 11. Gal. 5. 22. Romans 8. 11. faith is the
instrument of the holy Ghost, whereby the heart is cleansed. Col. 2. 12.

Q. What follows thereupon?
A. A fighting 21 and combating against sin and corruption. Gal. 5. 17.

Expos. 21. Those that are sanctified, are sanctified in every part, Col. 2.
11. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23. Ephesians. 4. 24. Col. 3. 10. and yet but in part, Pro. 30. 2,
3. Phil. 3. 12. Romans 8. 13. Col. 3. 5. so that grace and corruption are mingled
together in the best, Romans 6. 13. and 7. 25. whence follows a spiritual
combat, not of the mind with the will, or the will with the affections only,
Numb. 22. 34. nor of diverse desires only, in respect of sundry and different
considerations, but of the part regenerate with the part unregenerate, Gal. 5.
17. as of the mind regenerate, with the mind unregenerate, and so of the will,
etc. This combat is continual, against the first motions to sin, not only
against outward gross evil. Romans 8. 13. Ephesians. 4. 22. Romans 6. 17. The effect
hereof is, that a man sanctified cannot do what he would, Gal. 5. 17.
sometimes he is grievous foiled by the flesh, Matthew. 26. 40. 41. but in the
end the Spirit shall get the victory. 1. Io. 4. 4. and 5. 4. Romans 8. 2. Reu.
2. 26.

Q. What else?
A. A renouncing Act. 2. 38.
of all evil in 22 affection, and of 23 gross Act. 19. 18, 19.
sin in life and conversation.

Expos. 22. A pure heart can more delight in evil, then a clean fountain can
send forth corrupt waters, Psalm. 24. 4. Es. 32. 6. 8. Pro. 12. 5. therefore a
purged heart must renounce all evil. Ezekiel. 36. 26, 27. Ier. 32. 39, 40.

23. The will is the commander of the outward man, 2. Cor. 8. 11. if it be
turned unto God, the conversation must needs be reformed. Ier. 3. 14. 17. 1.
Sam. 12. 20, 21. 1. King. 8. 48, 49.

Q. What is a third thing that follows hence?
A. Love Psalm. 119. 97.
and 24 delight in that which is good, joined with a sincere 25 desire,
purpose, and Phi. 3. 13, 14. Act. 11. 23.
endeavor, daily to amend whatsoever is amiss, and to Psalm. 119. 6.
lead a life according 26 to the law of God.

Expos. 24. The same spirit which wrought the grace of faith, and cleanses the
heart, does sweetly incline it both to long after, and to cleave with joy to
that which is good. Ezekiel. 36. 37. Ezekiel. 11. 19, 20. Romans 6. 19. Psalm. 86. 11.

25. The true believer has laid aside the practice and desire of all sin,
Psalm. 119. 113. 128. 163. not only out of a foresight of the ill consequences,
and fearful evils that may fall, 1. King. 8. 47. Ezekiel. 18. 28. Luke 15. 17.
but even out of love to the chiefest good, and all goodness, 2. Cor. 5. 14. and
that with a true purpose, Psalm. 119. 106. Act. 11. 23. and well advised
deliberation, Ruth. 1. 16. therefore he is willing to epsy out, and reform
whatsoever is out of order, Psalm. 119. 59. But note here, that all have not the
like measure of grace, Romans 12. 3. neither can with like victory overcome
their corruption, Romans 14. 1. and 15. 1. Phi. 3. 15. The strong should not wax
proud, Romans 11. 20. Gal. 1. 1. Romans 14. 3. nor the weak be dismayed overmuch,
Romans 14. 4. Mar. 4. 31. 32.

26. The redeemed of the Lord do see that many ways they are bound to obey,
Psalm. 100. 2. 3. and 86. 13. 1. Cor. 6. 19, 20. 1. Pet. 1. 17, 18. and also
that it is a blessed thing to bear the yoke, Mat. 11. 29. 1. Io. 5. 3. Psalm.
65. 4. and 119. 14. Gal. 6. 16. and so they resolve to deny their own will,
and follow the Lord. Phi. 1. 27. and 3. 20. Act. 26. 7. 1. Pet. 4. 2, 3.

Q. Wherein is the sum of the Law contained?
A. In the Deuteronomy. 10. 4. and 4. 13.
ten 1 commandments.

Expos. 1. These ten commandments are an abridgement of the whole Law, the
full exposition whereof is to be found in the books of the Prophets and
Apostles, and holy men, who wrote by inspiration of the spirit, Ex. 34. 27. 1.
King. 8. 9. Matthew. 22. 40. For the right understanding of the ten
commandments called the Decalogue, observe these rules.

1. The law is spiritual, binding the soul and conscience to entire
obedience. Romans 7. 14. Matthew. 5. 21, 22. 27. 28.

2. The meaning of the precept is to be drawn from the maine scope and end
thereof. Matthew. 5. 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

3. The commandment which forbids a sin, commands the contrary duty,
and the commandment which requires a duty, forbids the contrary sin.
Psalm. 34. 12. 14. Esa. 1. 16, 17. Mar. 3. 4.

4. Under one vice expressly forbidden, all of the same kind, and that
necessarily depend thereon, as also the least cause, occasion, or inticement
thereunto are likewise forbidden. Mat. 5. 21, 22. 27, 28. 1. Ioh. 3. 15.

5. Under one duty expressed all of the like nature are comprehended, as all
means, effects, and whatsoever is necessarily required for the performance of
that duty, and therefore in diverse, yea in all the commandments one and the
same duty may in diverse respects be commanded, and one and the same sin may
be forbidden.

6. Where the more honorable person is expressed, as the man, let the woman
understand that the precept concerns her.

7. Where the duty of one man standing in relation to another is taught, there
is taught also the duties of all that stand in the like relation one unto
another; as when the duty of one inferior toward his superior is taught,
there is taught the general duty which all superiors owe to those that be
under them, which inferiors owe to them that be over them, and which equals
owe one to another.

Q. How are they divided?
A. Into two 2 Tables. Deuteronomy. 5. 22. and 10. 1, 2.


Expos. 2. From the commandments, as they are set down we may observe. 1.
That the law is most perfectly wise, just, equal, and strictly binding the
consciences of all men without exception, and that continually. Deuteronomy. 4. 5.
etc. Psalm. 19. 7. etc.

2. For order of doctrine, there is a perfect distinction of one commandment
from another, but as touching practice, they are so nearely knit together, that
no one can be perfectly obeyed, unless all be obeyed, and he that breaks
one commandment transgresses the, whole law. Deuteronomy. 27. 26. Gal. 3. 10. Iam.
2. 10. 11.

3. The love of God is the ground of our love to our neighbor. 1. Ioh. 4. 20.
and 5. 1.

4. Our love to our neighbor is a testimony of our love to God. Romans 13. 8,
9, 10.

5. Such as be truly religious, must have respect unto all Gods
commandments. Psa. 119. 6.

6. The duties of the first Table are most excellent, and the breaches thereof
more grievous then of the second, if equal proportion be observed, and
comparison be made. 1. Sam. 2. 25. Esa. 7. 13.

7. If two Commandments cannot be performed at once, the lesser must give
place to the greater: so the love of God must be preferred before the love of
our neighbor, and moral duties before outward circumstances. Hos. 6. 6.
Matthew. 12. 4.

8. The law is set forth as a rule of life to them that are in Christ,
therefore our obedience is to be performed unto God, in, and through Jesus
Christ. Matthew. 19. 17. 18. 19. Exodus 19. 6, 7, 8. with 20. 1. etc.

9. All sins here forbidden are to be shunned, and that both always and at
all times. The duties commanded are perpetual, to be practiced when the Lord
gives opportunity, and calls thereunto.

Q. Which are the Commandments of the first Table?
A. The four first, and they teach us the duty which we owe unto God
immediately.

Q. Which are the commandments of the second Table?
A. The six last, which instruct us in our duty toward our neighbor. Ephesians.
6. 2.


Q. Which is the first Commandment?
A. I am the Lord thy God, etc. Thou shall have none other Gods before my face.

Q. What is the general duty required in this commandment?
A. That in 3 mind, will, affection, and the effects of these, we take the true
God in Christ to be our God.

acknowledgement, estimation, Deuteronomy. 4. 39. Isa. 43. 10. Psalm. 89. 6, 7. etc. and

his good name, Romans 1. 1. Gal. 1. 23, 24. sorrow for his infirmities, Psalm.
119. 136. Ezra. 9. 6. and cover them in love, Pro. 17. 9. 1. Pet. 4. 8. hoping
the best with patience, and so judging, 1. Cor. 13. 5, 6, 7. not bewraying his
secrets before we have admonished him, Pro. 11. 12. and 25. 9, 10. yea though
we do it with grief, and to such as we desire might help and redress them,
rebuking him to his face, Matthew. 18. 15, 16. Gal. 2. 11. when just occasion
requires, but yet lovingly and meekely, Gal. 6. 1. Pro. 25. 12. with
remembrance of what is praiseworthy in him, 1. Cor. 1. 4. 10. Reu. 2. 2, 3, 4.
commending him where he deserved well, yet rather in his absence then presence,
1. These. 5. 22. defending the good name of him, whose unblameable carriage is
known unto us, by testimony, hand writing, and oath if need require, Philem.
10. 11. etc. not receiving idle or false reports against our brother, Psalm. 15.
3. Pro. 25. 23. and 26. 20.

Q. What is the general sin forbidden?
A. All failing to procure, defend, and further our 30 own, and 31 our
neighbors credit: all unjust defense, wrongful suspicion, or accusation of
our selves or others.

Expos. 30. Here is forbidden an over, or vnderweening of the good things in
our selves, Luke 18. 9, 10, 11. Exodus 4. 10. 13. Ier. 1. 7. bearing our selves
above our worth, Phil. 2. 3. boasting, Pro. 27. 1. excusing our selves
unjustly, 1. Sam. 15. 15. Genesis 3. 12. debasing our selves, dissembling that
others might praise us, procuring our selves an ill name by walking
indiscreetly or offensiuely, 2. Sam. 12. 14. Romans 2. 23, 24. and a needless
lessening the good opinion others have of us, by bewraying our weakness, as
want of learning, etc. to the carper.

31. Here are condemned evil, suspicions, Matthew. 7. 1. 1. Sam. 1. 13. want of
desire, care, and rejoicing in our neighbors good name, 1. Pet. 2. 1.
rejoicing in his infirmities, contempt, or foolish admiration of others, Act.
12. 22. Pro. 27. 14. unjustly renewing the memory of our neighbors crimes
which were in tract of time forgotten, Pro. 17. 9. calling good evil, or evil
good, Esa. ^. 20. flattery, Pro. 27. 14. Job. 17. 5. forbearing to speak in
the cause or credit of our neighbors, Pro. 24. 11, 12. and 31. 8, 9. rash
censuring, Matthew. 7. 1, 2. nodding the head, winking with the eye, pointing
with the finger, or any other vilifying or deriding gestures, Matthew. 5. 22.
speaking the truth with desire of our neighbors discredit, 1. Sam. 22. 14, 15.
with Psalm. 52. 1, 2, 3. listening to talebearers, Prou. 25. 23. raising false
reports, Leuit. 19. 16. relating men's words to their disgrace, contrary to
their meaning, 1. Sam. 22. 9, 10. Matthew. 26. 60, 61. spreading abroad flying
tales, Pro. 26. 20, 21, 22. libells, false presentiments and citations, giving
false evidence, and pronouncing false sentence, Leuit. 19. 15. 35. Exodus 23. 6.
Deuteronomy. 19. 16. Pro. 19. 5. In respect of our selves and our neighbors, here is
forbidden lying and equiuocating, Ephesians. 4. 25. Col. 3. 9, 10.

Q. What is the tenth Commandment?
A. Thou shall not covet, etc.

Q. What is the general duty here commanded?
A. That we be truly 32 contented with our own outward condition, and heartily
desire the good 1. Tim. 6. 8. 1. Cor. 7. 29, 30. Act. 26. 29.
of our neighbor in all things belonging unto him, great and small.

Expos. 32. In this commandment we are enjoined to acquaint our selves with
thoughts of good toward our neighbor, Esa. 32. 8. 3. Io. 2. Job. 31. 29. and
that which appeartaineth to him; to rejoice in the present good estate of our
selves and our neighbors, Psalm. 34. 2. and 119. 74. and cheerfully to praise
God for it.

Q. What is the general sin forbidden?
A. All thoughts of mind, wishes, and desi^es of heart, and delightful
remembrances of evil against contentednes. Job. 31. 29.


Q. Is any man able to keep this law?
A. Not perfectly: for the Iam. 3. 2.
godly often fall, the most holy 33 fail Exodus 28. 36, 37, 38.
34 always in their best actions: but the child of God ought 1. Ioh. 2. 14.
Ioh. 14. 15. 25.
, may, and usually does 1. King. 15. 5.
walk according to the law sincerely.

Expos. 33. In the servants of Christ there remains some root of bitterness,
Heb. 12. 1. Romans 7. 23. the flesh lusts against the spirit, Gal. 5. 17. their
knowledge is but in part, 1. Cor. 13. 12. Psalm. 119. 18. their obedience
therefore cannot be perfected. Ios. 9. 14. 15. 2. Sam. 12. 9. 12. 2. Chron. 35.
22. Luke 1. 20.

34. Often in the matter, and manner of doing, Josh. 9. 14. 15. continually in
the measure of duty, the most holy do offend. Neh. 13. 22.

Q. Should not a Christian omit doing of good altogether, seeing he cannot do
it in that measure that God requires?
A. No: but 35 with 2. Cor. 7. 1.
diligence and singlenes of heart, strive against corruption, look 2. Chron.
16. 9. Phil. 4. 13.
for the assistance of Gods Spirit, and labor to 1. Pet. 2. 2. and 2. Pet. 3.
18.
grow in grace.

Expos. 35. The sin which cleaving to the work defiles it, is by all means
possible to be avoided, Math. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. etc. Psalm. 37. 27. but the work
it self is not to be forborne. For we have an absolute charge from God, to
exercise our selves in all good works, Esa. 1. 17. 1. Pet. 3. 11. Col. 1. 10.
2. Pet. 1. 5. and a merciful promise, that he will forgive the infirmities,
which our corruption does fasten upon them, and favorably accept our sincere
endeavor to walk in all holy obedience, though now and then we thorough
weakness do step awry. Job. 42. 7. 2. Chro. 30. 19, 20. Esa. 40. 11. Can.
2. 14. Numb. 23. 21. Ezekiel. 34. 16.

Q. What means should a man use to grow in grace?
A. He must thoroughly examine 36 his Hag. 1. 5. 7.
ways, 37 judge 1. Cor. 11. 31.
himself, watch 38 over his heart, at all times, in all places, occasions, and
conditions, 2. Tim. 4. 5. Ephesians. 5. 16.
redeeming the 39 time, to store his 40 heart with good, and preserve Heb. 10.
35. 36. 38.
his 41 faith.

Expos. 36. Examination which is a diligent, exquisite, and impartial search
of our hearts, thoughts, and ways, Lam. 3. 40. by the word of God, Romans 7. 7.
as in his presence; is a special means to preserve from pride, security,
hardness of heart, and falling into sin, Heb. 3. 13. Psalm. 4. 4. It does
quicken to prayer, Genesis 24. 63. Psa. 19. 12. is a good step to repentance,
Ps. 119. 59. Hag. 1. 5. setleth in a Christian course, Psalm. 39. 1. prouokes
forward in godliness, Ps. 119. 59. 60. and makes charitable toward others.
Gal. 6.

37. To judge a man's self, is to pass an impartial sentence against
himself, agreeable to the word of God, according to the measure of that
iniquity which by examination he finds in himself, Ezec. 16. 61. and 20.
43. Dan. 9. 8. Luke 15. 18, 19. This awakeneth the heart, Ezec. 36. 31. makes
us afraid of sin, Genesis 39. 9. spurreth us to sue to the throne of grace, 1.
King. 8. 38. and preuenteth the judgments of God. 1. Cor. 11. 31.

38. Watchfulness, which is a narrow, careful, and continual keeping,
observing, and ouerseeing of our hearts, and all our ways, Prou. 4. 23. is
both exceeding necessary, seeing that of our selves we are apt to err, Psa.
95. 10. and have many occasions besides to draw us away from godliness, Luke
14. 18. 20. and exceeding profitable to prevent or withstand Satan, 1. Pet. 5.
8. Matthew. 26. 41. keep under lusts, avoid and cut off strayings and wanderings
of mind and life, 2. Tim. 4. 5. 1. Cor. 16. 13. Psa. 101. 2. keep the heart in
good order, and to eschew dangerous decaies, falls, and discomforts, which
otherwise men shall run into. 2. Sam. 11. 2. 1. Tim. 2. 14. 2. Cor. 11. 3.

39. To redeem time, is so to husband it, that every moment thereof may be
spent for our best advantage, Ephesians. 5. 16. Col. 4. 5. Time is a precious thing,
being lost it is unrecoverable, though God may pardon it to the penitent, Esa.
1. 16. 18. therefore we must redeem the time of youth, Eccl. 12. 1. of the
Gospel, 2. Cor. 6. 2. the Sabbath, Exodus 20. 10. the time of sickness,
health, and vacancie from business in our callings, etc. Luke 19. 42. Ioh. 9.
4. Gal. 6. 10. Pro. 10. 5.

40. When man's heart is emptied of evil, it will quickly gather filth again,
(as garments will dust,) unless it be fraught with good. Matthew. 12. 43, 44, 45.

41. If faith decay in us (as needs it must, unless it be carefully stirred up,
preserved, and exercised, 2. Tim. 1. 6.) godliness must needs wither, 1. Tim*
1. 5. for faith is the victory whereby we overcome the world, 1. Ioh. 5. 4.
thereby we wrestle against sin, by the almighty power of Jesus Christ, Gal.
2. 20. and our lives must needs be full of doubtings or security, drowned
with carnal delights, 1. Kin. 11. 4. and sinful pleasures, and the word will
loose it efficacy, Heb. 4. 2. the exercises of religion their sweetness. To
the end that faith might be preserved, we must value it above gold and silver,
2. Pet. 2. 1. often meditate upon the sweetness, Psalm. 119. 103. and 139. 17.
constancy, Reu. 1. 5. 2. Cor. 1. 20. and perpetuity of the most precious and
free promises which are the grounds of faith, Hos. 14. 5. Ezec. 36. 22. walk
according to the rules thereof, learn to exercise it living thereby, Heb. 10.
38. Romans 1. 17. and sincerely, constantly, and conscionably use all those
means, whereby faith is wrought or nourished.

Q. How else?
A. He must take Ephesians. 6. 14.
unto him the whole armor 42 of God, and with Prou. 2. 3, 4. Coloss. 4. 2.
care, uprightness, and constancy use the means of grace before prescribed,
in one Job 27. 10.
estate as well as another.

Exp. 42. All Christians are called to be soldiers, Reu. 12. 7. to fight under
Christ Jesus their captain, against the flesh, Romans 8. 13. the world, 1. Ioh.
2. 16. and the devil, 1. Pet. 5. 8, 9. a spiritual, subtle, and malicious
enemy, Ephesians. 6. 12. Reu. 20. 2. Matthew. 13. 28. 39. that can never be appeased;
they had need therefore take unto them the whole armor of God, which they must
daily put on, and continually keep on, that at all times they have it ready
for use, to repel and quench the fiery darts of the devil. The parts of this
armor are sincerity, love of righteousness, the gospel, faith, lively hope,
and the word of God, Ephesians. 6. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. These are kept on by earnest
prayer, watchfulnes, and holy meditation.

Q. What privileges does God afford unto his children in this life, who labor
according to his will to grow in grace?
A. 1 They may be 1. Ioh. 3. 13. Io. 1. 12.
assured 2 of his favor and fatherly 3 care 1. Tim. 4. 10. Mat. 10. 30.
over them, the direction Psa. 143. 10.
of his spirit, their Col. 1. 9, 10.
growth in 4 grace, and Phi. 1. 6.
perseverance to the end.

Expos. 1. It is first of all to be observed that none of these privileges can
be enjoyed without great strife and labor. 1. Cor. 16. 13.

2. Not only some uncertain hope, or dim sight of Gods favor, but assurance
thereof may in this life be obtained, Job. 19. 25. 2. Cor. 5. 1. 2. Tim. 4. 8.
and 1. 12. for the Scripture exhortes us to make our calling and election sure,
2. Pet. 1. 10. lays many sufficient grounds of assurance, 1. Ioh. 4. 13. and
3. 14. Phil. 1. 6. and proposes diverse examples of them, who have attained
thereunto, Romans 8. 34. 38, 39. Luke 2. 29. Heb. 11. 9, 10. This is a rare and
precious privilege, because it may constantly be inioyed with an increase
thereof, Hos. 13. 14. Malac. 3. 6. 1. These. 4. 1. 10. is always accompanied
with joy unspeakable, and sweet contentment, Cant. 1. 1. Psa. 4. 6, 7. Ioh.
8. 56. 1. Pet. 1. 8. and the longer it is possessed, the sweeter it is; dainty
meats may become loathsome, but we cannot surfeit of Gods favor. Psa. 17. 15.

3. God would have his children know that in every state he will save and uphold
them, Ps. 9. 10. and 32. 6, 7. even when his wrath does burn against his
enemies, Esa. 33. 4, 5, 6. and 27. 7, 8. he will teach them the good way which
they ought to follow, Ps. 25. 12. 14. Pro. 3. 32. give his angels charge over
them, carry them in his bosom, Ps. 91. 11. 12. etc. The amiable, sweet, and
comfortable titles that Christ gives to his spouse, calling her my love, my
dove, my sister, my spouse, my undefiled, does show what great regard he has
of every Christian. Can. 1. 8, 9. and 2* 14.

4. The servants of Christ are exhorted and commanded, to grow in grace and
godliness, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1. 10. Col. 1. 10. there are patterns of holy men
left unto us in Scriptures, that have grown rich in wisdom and holiness,
Revel. ^. 19. what God commands in the Gospel, that Christians should
believe he will enable them to do, Ioh. 6. 63. 1. Ioh. 5. 3. and what ordinary
grace any of the faithful did obtain, the same may all the faithful look
for, Zach, 12. 10. Ephesians. 4. 4. 2. Pet. 1. 1. if it be for their good, Romans 8.
28. for they are all under the same covenant, have the same redeemer and
sanctifier, and have the same promises made unto them. 2. Cor. 6. 18. 1. Tim.
2. 5. 6. Ephesians. 4. 30. and 2. 12.

Q. What other privileges does God afford unto them?
A. They are 5 kept Psalm. 32. 10. Act. 16. 25.
from, comforted in, and delivered out Prou. 11. 8.
of many troubles, taught to Lam. 3. 27. Phil. 4. 12.
use all estates aright 6, preserved Luke 1. 6.
from 7 soul offenses, enabled 8 to Psalm. 37. 23, 24.
rise again, if they Ephesians. 2. 10.
fall, instructed to 9 live godly, and have Luke 8. 15.
possession 10 of the word.

Expos. 5. The godly shun the sins which others follow with greediness,
Genesis 39. 9. and 42. 18. Neh. 5. 15. Job 31. 1. order their affairs with godly
wisdom, Act. 23. 6. and 22. 26. and 18. 11. with 19. 37. and foresee the
evil to come and hide themselves, Prou. 22. 3. and 26. 12. therefore they are
preserved from many troubles that others fall into: and yet for want of care
and watchfulness, they often draw no small grief upon their heads, from
which they might be free, if they would carefully subdue their passions, and
look unto their ways. Can. 5. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 2. Sam. 11. 2. 3. Psa. 51. 8.

6. In prosperity the godly are taught to edify themselves, Act. 9. 31. to
walk in meekness, lowliness, fear, and comfort of the Lord, doing good,
Job 14. 15. ^1. 24. in adversity, to be humble, patient, pray, 1. Pet. 5. 6.
Job 1. 21. Psalm. 39. 9. and 30. 7, 8. grow out of love with this world, 2.
Cor. 4. 1. 2. 3. 4. prize the Lords favor, Psalm. 73. 26. 28. cleave close unto
God, examine their hearts, and reform their ways, Lam. 3. 40. Zeph. 2. 1. Es.
27. 9. In their callings to take trial of their wisdom, faith, sincerity,
love of righteousness, and patience, and so to go about the same mith hearts
affecting the things that be above. Psa. 112. 5. Genesis 31. 38, 39, 40. Gal. 5.
22. Genesis 17. 1, 2. Zach. 8. 16. Luke 21. 19.

7. If the godly be overtaken with some reproachful evil, Genesis 9. 21. and 19.
33. it is not ordinary, Romans 8. 1. 2. Cor. 5. 7. but for a time, Ps. 37. 34.
when they have cast off their armor, and neglect their watch, 2. Sam. 11. 1.
2. Mat. 26. 40. 41. the Lord suffering them to fall, to let them see their
weakness, correct their carelesnes, cure in them pride of heart, and contempt
of others, and ordering their slips for the glory of his great name, the
comfort of the weak, and the good of the party fallen, after that by
repentance he is risen again.

8. The righteous may fall, but the Lord will not suffer them to perish, Ioh.
10. 28. Christ has prayed for them, Ioh. 17. 20. Luke 22. 32. the immortal
seed abides in them, 1. Ioh. 3. 9. the spirit of God does quicken them, Romans
8. 2. 11. so that afterward they take heart and courage again to sight against
sin and Satan; therefore they can never be utterly vanquished, though for a
time they be thrown down. 2. Cor. 4. 8. 9.

9. If the faithful seek unto the Lord, he will teach them with delight and
comfort to live godly in all places, and callings, Prou. 2. 3. 4. 9. Esa. 30.
21. but yet they shall find the flesh rebelling against the Spirit, Gal. 5. 17.
Psalm. 42. 5. 11. that they might not trust to themselves, but in the Lord,
Prou. 3. 5, 6. no longer live, then find need to pray, Lord strengthen me, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 17. be thankful to God for the mercies they have received, Psalm. 54.
6, 7. not triumph before the victory, nor walk in security, as though they
had no enemy, 1. Pet. 5. 8, 9. and that by how much the fight is more
painful, sharp, and difficult, by so much the victory should be the more
delightful, sweet, and glorious. Romans 16. 20. Reu. 12. 10.

10. The word of God is possessed when it is received truly as our own, is
kept and laid up safely, as a treasure in our minds and hearts, so that we
have it in readiness, for our direction and comfort, and does rule over us with
an holy and universal sovereignty. Luke 2. 51. Col. 3. 16, 17. Psalm. 119.
111. 112. 33. 34.

Q. Do all the godly, or any at all times enjoy all these privileges?
A. No: some are ignorant of them, not believing, or at least faintly
beeleeuing that there are such; others are careless, who prize not, and so
take not pains for these things as they ought.

Q. What other hindrances do deprive Christians of these privileges?
A. Iam. 4. 1, 2, 3.
Inordinate passions, as fear, anger, self-love, pride, love of pleasure,
cares of the world, and earthly incumberances, and inconstancy in good duties;
temptations also to distrust, do keep under many.

Q. How should a man bridle and reform these unruly passions?
A. Let him highly esteem a Christian life, pray earnestly, set himself most
against the corruptions that be strongest in him, shun the occasions of sin,
hide the Psalm. 119. 51.
commandment in his heart, and apply 1. Ioh. 5. 4.
the death of Christ for the killing of corruption.

Q. How may a man overcome his temptations to distrust?
A. He must not give credit Mat. 4. 3, 4.
to Satan's suggestions against Gods truth: but consider of Gods Matthew. 8. 2.
Esa. 40. 28.
11 power Psalm. 51.
, goodness, Ier. 31. 3.
unchangeableness, former Psalm. 77. 11.
mercies, and free Romans 5. 8, 9.
grace in giving us his son 12: so that weakness, unworthiness, want of
feeling comfort, should not dismay him,

11. God is in power all-sufficient, so that he can help us, Ephesians. 3. 20. and
in love everlasting, Io. 13. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 16. Ier. 31. 3. seeing then he
has once loved us, we may be assured that he will never leave us. Ph. 4. 19.

Expos. 12. God gives Christ to them that are lost in themselves, Esa. 61. 1.
2. Matthew. 8. 12, 13. and the weak as well as the strong are partakers of his
merits, 1. Ioh. 2. 1. strength of grace in us, and soundnes of a Christian
conversation, is not the root of comfort; neither should weakness, and
unworthiness in us breed doubting of our salvation, Heb. 10. 22. The ground of
all comfort is, that God of his free grace has given his Son to us miserable
sinners, even to as many as believe in him, 1. Io. 2. 2. and Io. 3. 16. and the
weak faith does lay hold upon Christ as truly, though not so comfortably, as
the strong does. 1. Io. 2. 12. 13. 14.

Q. What else must be done?
A. Consider what promises the Lord has made, to Matthew. 19. 18. Luke 22. 32.
keep and uphold us, what 1. Ioh. 3. 23.
encouragements he has given us to believe 13, and how acceptable a thing it
is Matthew. 8. 10. and 15. 28. Romans 4. 20.
that we should so do.

Expos. 13. God commands, persuades, entreats the thirsty and burdened to
believe, has bound himself by covenant unto them, Esa. 43. 25. sealed it by
the Sacraments, and confirmed the same by oath, Genesis 22. 16. 17. Psalm. 105. 9.
Luke 1. 73. And the deeper our misery is, the more we glorify his name by
resting upon him for succor, Psa. 22. 1. Romans 4. 18. 20.

Q. What other things is to be learned for the ouercomming of these temptations?
A. We must judge our selves Psalm. 119. 11. Psalm. 13. 1.
not by present 14 feeling, or by our own Psalm. 51. 10.
decerning the fruits of grace, but by that which we Psalm. 77. 11.
have felt, and the 2. Cor. 2. 10. 11.
fruits of grace which appear to others.

Expos. 14. A man may have faith that feels not comfort and grace, that sees
not the fruits of grace, Psalm. 22. 1. and 77. 8. 9. The soul is sometimes
sick, Ezekiel. 34. 4. 16. Cant. 3. 5. and sometimes in a swound, Cant. 5. 6.
sometimes we judge amiss of our estate, Psalm. 116. 10. 11. and 77. 10.
observing what motions we have to evil, but not how we resist them, supposing
we have no grace, because we have not what grace we desire, or because we find
not our selves at all times alike affected, and comforted, or else we want what
others have, or we conceit them to have; whereas God gives not all graces to
one man, nor to all in the same measure, Ephesians. 4. 7. Zach. 12. 8. And also it is
the property of men in affliction, to admire small things in others, and deny
great and many graces in themselves. Likewise the vastnes of desire causes
that which is much in comparison to seem nothing. Satan works upon the
timorous disposirion of some* and persuades them that they have fearfully
consented to those suggestions which they always abhorred, and in which they
never took delight: or that they wilfully offend, when some sinful motions
arise in their hearts, to which they do not consent, but which they resist,
praying to God for forgiveness and assistance; and because we in temptations
want one grace which accompanies faith, to wit, joy, Io. 8. 56. 1. Pet. 1. 8.
we conclude that we have no faith at all, whereas faith and joy be not
inseparable companion, Job. 13. 15. Heb. 11. 1. Psalm. 77. 2, 3. the violence of
tcmptation hindering the sense of mercy, when God does not withhold comfort;
for which causes we must not overmuch trust our selves, or credit our feeling,
but give credit, to the testimony of the godly and faithful..

Q. What may be a further help beside?
A. It is good to Psalm. 4. 4.
examine our 15 hearts, and use the advice 1 Thessalonians. 5. 14.

Expos. 15. God withholds or withdraws comfort sometimes, by reason of

therefore wisely to take trial of our ways, neither sparing any sin, nor
censuring that to be sin, which is just and lawful, not making light account
of any sin, nor yet calling our repentance into question, because some things
have been amiss, or we have not attained to perfection.
