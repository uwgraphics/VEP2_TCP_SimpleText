The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield: WITH Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.


IN Wakefield their lives a jolly Pinder,
in Wakefield all on a green,
in Wakefield all on a green.
There is neither Knight, nor Squire, said the Pinder,
nor Baron that is so bold,
nor Baron that is so bold.
Dare make a trespass to the town of Wakefield,
but his Pledge goes to the Pinfold, etc.
All this beheard three witty young men,
'twas Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John, etc.
With that they espied the jolly Pinder,
as he sat under a thorn, etc.
Now turn again, turn again, said the Pinder,
for a wrong way you have gone, etc.
For you have forsaken the Kings Highway,
and made a path over the Corn, etc.
O that were great shame said jolly Robin,
we being three, and thou but one, etc.
The Pinder leapt back then thirty good foot,
'twas thirty good foot and one, etc.
He leaned his back fast unto a thorn,
and his foot against a stone, etc.
And there he fought a long summers day,
a summers day so long, etc.
Till that their swords on their broad bucklers,
were broke fast unto their hands, etc.
Hold thy hand, hold thy hand, said Robin Hood,
and my merry men every one, etc.
For this is one of the best Pinders,
that ever I tried with Sword, etc.
And will thou forsake thy Pinders craft,
and live in green wood with me, etc.
At Michaelmas next my Covenant comes out,
when every man gathers his fee, etc.
I Will take my blew blade all in my hand,
and plod to the green wood with thee, etc.
Have thou either Meat or Drink said Robin Hood
for my merry men and me, etc.
I have both Bread and Beef, said the Pinder,
and good Ale of the best, etc.
And that is meat good enough, said Robin Hood,
for such unbidden Guest, etc.
O will thou forsake the Pinder his craft,
and go to the Green-wood with me, etc.
Thou shall have a livery twice in the year,
the one green, the other brown, etc.
If Michaelmas day was come and gone,
and my Master had paid me my fee.
and my Master had paid me my fee.
Then would I set as little by him,
as my Master does by me,
as my Master does by me.
The Noble Acts Newly found, Of Arthur of the Table Round.
To the Tune of, Flying Fame.
WHen Arthur first in Court began,
and was approved King.
By force of arms great victories won,
and conquest home did bring,
Then into Britain strait he came
where fifty stout and able
Knights, then repaired unto him
which were of the round Table.
And many Iusts and Tournaments
before him there were pressed,
Wherein these Knights did then excel,
and far surmount the rest,
But one Sir La^celot du Lake,
who was approved well,
He in his fights and deeds of arms,
all other did excel.
When he had rested him a while,
to play, and game, and Sport.
He thought he would approve himself
in some adventurous sort:
He armed rode id Forest wide,
and met a Damosel fair,
Who told him of adventures great,
whereto he gave good ear.
Why should I not (quoth Lancelot tho)
for that cause came I hither:
Thou seem, quoth she a Knight right good
and I will bring thee thither,
Whereas the mightiest Knight does dwell,
that now is of great fame:
Wherefore tell me what Knight thou art
and then what is thy name,
My name is Lanc^^ot ^u Lake,
quoth she, it likes me then,
He^r dwells a Knight that never was
over matched of any man,
Who has in Prison threescore Knights,
and some that he has bound,
Knights of King Arthurs Court they be,
and of the Table round.
She brought him to a River then,
and alsto a Tree,
Whereas a Copper Basin hung,
his fellows shield to see.
He struck so hard the Basin broke,
when Tarquin heard the sound,
He drove a horse before him strait,
whereon a Knight was bound.
Sir Knight (then said Sir Lancelot)
bring me that horse-load hither,
And lay him down and let him rest,
we will try our force together:
For as I understand thou have,
as far as thou art able,
Done great dispight and ^^ame unto
the Knights of the round Table.
If thou art of the Table round,
quoth Tarquin speedily,
Both thee and all thy fellowship,
I utterly defy.
That Is overmuch quoth Lancelot tho,
defend thee by and by,
They put their Spurs unto their Steeds
and each at other fly,
They couch their Spears and Horses run,
as though they had been thunder,
And each struck then upon the Shield,
wherewith they brake asunder.
Their Horses backs brake under them
the Knights were both astoned
To void their horses they made haste
to light upon the ground:
They took them to their shields full fast,
their swords they drew out then,
With mighty strokes most eagerly
each one at other run
They wounded were and bled full sore
for breath they both did stand,
And leaning on their swords a while,
quoth Tarquin hold thy hand.
And tell to me what I shall ask,
say on quoth ^ancelot tho,
Thou art quoth Ta^qu^n the best Knight
that ever I did know,
And like a Knight that I did hate,
so that thou be not he,
I will deliver all the rest.
and eke accord with thee,
That is well said, quoth Lancelot then,
but since it so must be:
What is the Knight thou hate so,
I pray thee show to me?
His name is Sir ^ncelot du Lake,
he slew my Brother dear,
Him I suspect of all the rest,
I would (...) had him here.
Thy wish thou have, but now unknown,
(...) am Lancelot du Lak^.
Now Knight of A^^hurs Table round
Kings H^nds Son of Benwake:
And I defy thee, do thy worst,
ha, ha, quoth Tarquin tho,
One of us two shall end their Lives
before that we do go.
If thou be Lancelot du Lake,
then welcome shall thou be,
Wherefore see thou thy self defend,
for now I do thee Defy.
They hurled then together fast,
like two wild Boars so rashing,
And with their Swords and shields they ran,
at one another flashing,
The ground besprinkled was with Blood
Tarquin began to faint,
For he had hackt and bore his Shield
so low he did repent,
That soon espied Sir Lancelot tho,
he leapt upon him then
He pulled him down upon his Knee,
and rushed off his Helm:
And then he struck his Neck in two,
and when he had done so,
From prison threescore Knights and four.
Lancelot delivered tho
