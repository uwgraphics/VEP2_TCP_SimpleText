The True-Lovers Good Morrow.
A brace of Valentines I here persent,
Who now together live in hearts content:
These luckily did meet upon the way,
In February on the fourteenth day.
The Tune is, As at Noon Dulcina rested.


Bachelor. In the month of February,
the green leaves begin to spring;
Pretty Lambs trip like a Fairy,
Birds do couple, bill, and sing;
All things on earth,
That draws breath,
In love together then do join,
Why should not I.
My fortune try,
And seek me out a Valentine.
Thanks kind fate I have my wishes,
for I have now met my dear,
Whom I greet with honey kisses,
her sweet sight my heart does cheer,
My dearest love,
And Turtle-Dove,
O let my arms about thee twine,
For thou art she,
I first did see,
Good morrow my fair Valenine.



Maid. Surely Sir you are mistaken,
for you met some other Maid,
Young Men they are given to scoffing,
and as much to her you said;
Then do not stay
Me on the way,
with your sweet words that you do coin
Let me alone,
I must be gone,
Pray seek some other Valentine.

Bachelor. If true faith may be believed,
on you first I did set sight,
Sweet let not my heart be grieved,
who does love your beauty bright,
Often have I wished
I might be blessed,
With your sweet presence for to join
And case my mind,
Maids should be kind,
And loving to their Valentine.

Maid. SIr, to me you are a stranger,
Maids must look before they leap
In fair specehes often there is danger,
snakes under sweet flowers Creep,
maids often find
men's words but wind,
The Sun shall set that bright did shine,
after a calm,
there comes a storm,
Go seek some other Valentine.

Bachelor. Fortune fair has now decreed it,
that none but you I should meet,
Dearly I do love, believe it,
for you are my only sweet,
my grieved breast
can take no rest,
Which does my lovesick heart conjoyn
Love I require
Love I desire,
Of thee my beauteous Valentine.

Maid. For your affection Sir I thank you,
being more then my desert,
Sure I cannot be so cruel,
to procure a Lovers smart,
It Is modesty
for to deny,
Yet from my words I may decline,
then banish pain,
take heart again,
For I will be thy Valentine.

Bachelor. Now thou speak like an Angel,
and my drooping heart revive,
For to give all contentment,
day and night i will ever strive,
thy courteous words,
much joy affords,
And thy rare beauty so divine,
sweet let me kiss,
my fair mistress,
My only joy and Valentine.

Maid. If you intend what you have promised
and do love me as you say,
I may yield, but if you flatter,
I can my affection stay:
now I am free
as you may see,
No man can say that I am thine.
but being bound,
no help is found,
And then no more sweet Valentine.

Bachelor. When I from my promise alter,
let me then no longer thrive,
And let nothing with me prosper,
while that I remain alive.
pains I Will not spare,
but still take care,
For to maintain thee neat and fine,
and for the best
that can be dressed,
Then thou shall eat sweet Valentine.

Maid. Seeing you are so kind hearted,
I have freely given consent,
And my love to thee imparted,
hoping never to repent:
i will constant prove,
to thee my Love,
For I am thine, and thou art mine,
i will saving be,
as thou shall see,
Sweet Husband, friend and Valentine.

Bachelor. A thousand thousand thanks I render
back again to thee my love,
Who above the world I tender,
my firm faith shall never remove,
then presently
to Church let us hye,
Where in Hymen's band's let us join,
take hand and heart,
till death depart,
My life, my Wife, and Valentine.
