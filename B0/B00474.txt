A New Ballade of a Lover / Extollinge his Lady.
To the tune of Damon and Pithias.
^ALas my heart does boil, and burn with in my breast: To show to thee mine

^onely dear, my suit and sure request. My love no tongue can tell, ne pen can
well descrye:

^Extend thy Love for love again? Or else for Love I dye.

My love is set so suer,
And fixed on thee so:
That by no means I can abstain,
My faithful love to show,
My wounded heart theirfore:
To thee for help does cry:
Extend thy love for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
Although the Gods were bent,
With greedy mind to slaye:
My corpse with cruel panges of death,
And life to take away.
yet should my faithful heart,
At no time from thee fly:
Show love therefore for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
Although the Sun were bent,
To burn me with his beams:
and that mine eyes throw greuos pa^gs,
Should send forth bloody streams.
yet would I not for sake,
But still to thee wolude cry:
To show me love for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
ye though each sterre were tournd,
Until a fiery darte:
And were all ready bent with pain,
To perce throw out my heart.
yet could I not forsake,
To love thee faythfullye,
Extend thy love for love again,
Or else for love I dye.


ye though each foul were formde,
A Serpent fell to be:
My corpse to slay with bloody wounds,
And to deuower me.
yet would I be thine own,
To love full hartelye:
Extend thy love for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
ye though the Lion were,
with gapinge gredye Iawe:
Ready with rygorus raggye teeth,
My flesh to tear and gnawe,
yet would I be thine own,
To serve most earnestlye:
Extend thy love, for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
ye though the fishes all,
That swymes in surginge sease:
should swallowe me with gredy mouth
yet could thee not apease.
My earnest heart to thee,
To love entyerlye:
Extend thy love for love again,
Or else for love I dye.
ye though the earth would gape,
And swallowe me there in:
And that I should tormentyd be,
In hell with every fyn.
yet would I be thy own,
To save or else to spyll:
Show me therefore like love again
Or else thou do me kill.
Finis.
