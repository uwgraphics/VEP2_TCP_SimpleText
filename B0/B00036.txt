FOrasmuch as we are bruted and defamed with many-maner of false Reports and
Eyes / by certain maliti^^^ and slanderous Persons; that (...) as-yet communed
with us of (...) such Things as they criminate and ^^^rge us with-all; to the
great De^^nge and Hindering of us / and our ^^od-name and Fame / among such
(...) whom we rest as-yet unknown / that they might thereby bring us ^o a
Contempt and Obloquie / and make us detestable and monsterous ^^^^re the Eyes
of ye Common People: also have moved; with such their underous Reports; the
spiritual ^ulers or Maiestrates / to cast some is into Prison / and driven us
therthrough to great Trouble and Charges / wher-as men have not justly to
blame, accuse, detect, or burden us / as Transgressors of the Law (be-it
against any of the Queene-her Maiesti^s Proceedinges in Causes Ecclesiastical
/ or-els in her politic Laws of Government in Causes Temporal) but have
always shewe^ ourselves (life as it becomes leig^ Subjects to do) to live
and wall in all dutiful Obedience; loyally toward the same / and applied o^
endeavored us; to the vtterest of ou^ Power; to the Fulfillinge of the
R^quiring thereof / if we might be rig^^lie tried therein / by the Voice of the
Country wheare we dwell / and I such as know us / or with whom w^ have had
to deal / and not by ye M^litious / which envy us in our W^dooinge and
Reasonable-dealinge^ So are we therefore; out of speci^^ occasion; moved and
urged [to the ^tter answering and satisfying of all ^aiestrates both spiritual
and tem^^^all / and of such as are resonablie^inded / and that rest-doutfull of
our ^ight Cause (more for that they ^^ue not any just Intelligence of the ^e
Case and State of the same / then (...) that they rest wholly stayed upon ^^ch
frivolous, unseemly, and untrue ^rutes as go-fourth against us) that they
might think thereof ^e^lie; as here insueth; to set-downe (...) extract or
short Note / both of the ^rticles of our christen Belief / as al^ the Ground
of our synceere Re^^gion and sound Profession.

Deus Charitas est.
GEeing then that it is meet and requisite / that every upright ^eleeuer in
Jesus Christ / render an Answer of his Faith / when he is required thereto
(being falsely accused* contrary to his right Belief) / so can we not
therefore omit / to confess and acknowledge our upright and true Faith /
against all those that unjustly accuse us / in our right Belief.

First-of-all / we acknowledge and confess / that we know nor hold^ not of
any other Belief / then tha^ which is required by the Propheates of God / out
of the Law of the Lord / and whereon the holy Apostles and Evangelists of
Jesus Christ, have builded and stood-grounded / and lik^ as the same is also
taught and confessed by the Communialtie of the Saincte^ of Jesus Christ.

For we believe in the living God of Heaven, the Father almighty / and the
true Maker of Heaven and Earth.

And we believe in Jesus Christ* his only Son, our Lord: which was
conceived by the Holie-gost and borne of the Virgin Marie: He suf^^^^d passion
under Pontius Pilate: (...) crucified, dead, and buried / and ^^^^ended into
Hell: and the third ^^y / He rose-againe from ye Death: (...) ascended to the
Heavens / and ^^are He sits at the Right Hand (...) God / his Father
almighty: From ^^ence we believe He is to com / to ^^^ge both the Quick and
the Dead. And we believe in the Holie-gost: ^^e holy Catholike-church / the
Com^^nion of Saints: the Remission Sins: the Resurrection of the ^odye: and
the Life everlasting. ^men.

WE acknowledge likewise / the Father / to be God / vncrea^^d and eternal / a
strong or mighty spirit / a perfect clear Light / and a ^^ue Beeinge or
Substance: and ^^at the same true Beeinge, is his Name / and the Love itself.

Me acknowledge also, ye Sonn^ to be God, out of God / of the very-lik^
Beeinge; or very-same Substance of his Father / the very true and only
begotten Son of God / begotten from Euerlastingnes / and; in the Ful^nes of
the time; borne of a Virgin out of the Seed of David according to the Fleash:
the Son of Man: the Savior of the World: the tru^ Messiah: a Mediator
alone / betwixt God and Man: In whos^ Name only (and in none-other) we^
obtain Salvation / and the Remission of our Sins.

We acknowledge likewise, the holie-gost to be God (as proceeding from God the
Father and his Son Jesus Christ) and the true Spirit of God: the Comforter:
and the Dyle or Annoyntinge, wherwithall God annoynteth his elected People
either Ho^^e-church. For They are, out of (...) Grace of God the Father;
vnde^ed; redeemed, justified, and made-(...) through the Cross / Death /
Pas^^^^ / and Bloud-sheaddinge of Jesus ^rist: Which Holie-gost / does di^ and
lead all his Anointed, in^^ ^ll Truth. For They only / are (...) true
circumcised Israelites out of (...) Faith of Abraham, or the right ^^ristians,
through the Satisfacti^^ of Christ, in the Holy of the true ^abernacle /
wherein they daily take^^ their Cross on them, with Him / ^^d followe-after
Christ, in all God^nes and Truth / to the Purginge (...) their Sins,
til-into his Love: In whom also ye Spirit of Christ, dwel^eth, lives, and
woorketh / and not ^rtenlie; in Any-other.

FArdermore / we believe and acknowledge, concerning this ^^e-onelie living
God (the Father / Son / and Holie-gost / with ye Communialtie of his
Saints) all and every Part that is written and confessed (by the holy
Fathers) in the old and new Testament, of or concerning the same Godhead / to
be a Thing most. true / and very-needfull that every Christian believe,
acknowledge, and confess the same / and also live therein. So do we in
like-maner acknowledge, all the rest of holy Scripture aforesaid / as likewise
all what-euer accords with the Mind of ye same (being set-fourth and
instituted by holy Fathers, out of the true Light) to be an upright, godly,
and healthsom Doctrine / and so ought to be taken and acknowledged of all
Christians: But All whatsoever accords not therewith, that hold we not for
anything necessary unto Salvation / but rather for that which proceeds out
of ye Man's Imagination / and not out of the Spirit of Christ.

Now follovveth the Confession of our Religion.
CONsideringe the great Love of God toward us and Mankind / in that He has
cre^^^^ the Man like-vnto his own I^^ge / as also set him in the Fulness (...)
^ife: and how that He has more (...) (when we were become his Ene^^^s;
through the Transgressing of (...) Word; and Children of Death) ^^e farther
extended his Love tow^^^es us / and sent his only Son ^^^us Christ into this
World / which ^^th; to our Atonement; suffered the ^eath of the Cross, which
we our^^^^es were guilty in: When we ^^w consider all this great Love ex^ded
on us / so are we moved to (...) Him again / standing euenso Re^ati or
bound-againe [and so Religi^^] to love ye same God of Life, with all our Heart
/ Soul / and Might and also our Neighbor as ourselue^ And for-that-cause, to
thend that w^ might vprightlie shewe-fourth the same, both in the Deed and
Truet^ we read the holy Scripture of t^^ Propheates and Apostles of Christ
and all other Books which exhor^ us unto such an upright Life / and Lo^^ of
God and our Neighbor: not ^singe any other Ceremonies / Lawe^ Statutes nor
Sacraments of Ba^tisme and Supper-of-ye-lord / then su^ as are ministered in ye
Church of En^lande. And to that end obey we a^ so our sovereign Lady, the
Quee^ and ye Maiestrates; our Fore-goer^ both spiritual and temporal: (...)
that of God-his behalf / and even (...) our Conscience and the Peaces can (...)
payinge all Tribute unto these-s^^^ Maiestrates: living obedientlie a^^
subiectlie; even as it is meet and rig^ (...) their Laws: and also dealing
(...) all Men vprightlie, faithfully, (...) charitablie (euen-like as we
our^^^^^^ would gladly be dealt-withall (...) ^^eir Hands) keepinge likewise
(...) with Al-men / so far as is pos^^^^^ for us. And this we hold to be
(...) fulfillinge both of the Law and ^^^^heates / as likewise the Doctrine
(...)word christ and his Apostles (as is (...)) contained in the Old and New
^^^tament. And our Conscience bea^ ^s record / that all such Single^dones
ought to be defended by (...) Governors, from all Injustice and Tirannical
oppression.

THissame is; finally; the Contents of our Belief / and the ^nde of our
Religion, briefly de^ / and what we acknowledge (...) ^^onfesse concerning
the same, even (...) the Bottom of our Hearts: and (...) also required of
eueryone; thorough the gracious Word of Lif^ in the Service of the Love of
Ies^^ Christ: and not els-what. And w^ think this our Confessinge;
heerewitnessed; to be sufficient before (...) christian Maiestrates, both
spiritu^ and temporal / and for all Reson^ble-men. Hoping also therefore
(ina^much as we endeavor us to live su^iectlike and peaceably under our
Pr^^ces Laws) that our Cause shall (...) with Justice; considered, to a
R^leassinge of us from this our Subie^tiued-bondage of Straightnes /
P^^turbation / and great Charges, wh^in we now are bewrapped and se^ without
just cause of our part des^^ued. etc.

Let eueryone consider and way our Cause vprightlie.
