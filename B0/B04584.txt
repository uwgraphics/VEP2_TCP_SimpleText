A NEW SONG of Mallinger, OR, The Female Dear-Joy tricked of her Maidenhead.
To a New Irish Tune.
AS I went to Mallinger Fair
with my Barrel of Bear,
I met with young Peggie,
who is Beauty was clear.
Ratting a rue
Ratting a Rue re rue re-rew re-rew,
Rating a Rue re-rew re-rew re-rew,
Fa re-rew re-rew re-reen
Fa re-rew re rue re-reen,
Hay bew Hoi baen,
Ratting a rue.
Her Eyes they were black,
and her Face it was clear;
Her Lips was like Correll,
and white was her hair.
Ratting a rue, etc.
Her Voice sounded sweetly
as she went along,
For she was singing
a delicate Song.
Ratting a rue, etc.
Sweet Peggie said I,
your Beauty's so bright,
And your Voice is so sweet,
makes me wish for delight.
Ratting a rue, etc.
My Dearest said I,
let me kiss your white hand,
And all that I have
shall be at your Command.
Ratting a rue, etc.
Dear Peggie said I,
to the Tavern let us go,
A Bottle of Wine
I will on thee bestow.
Ratting a rue, etc.
I will give thee fine Rigging
and toping to wear,
And a pair of new gloves
at Mallinger Fair.
Ratting a rue, etc.
The more I did Court her,
the more she was shey*
Till at length I resolved
a Trick for to try.
Ratting a rue, etc.
Then I gave her a Kiss,
and well pleased was she,
And for to go with me
she straight did agree;
Ratting a rue, etc.
Alas my Dear Peggie
why are you so unkind,
For we shall be Married
when the D -- goes blind.
Ratting a rue, etc.
The sweetest Delight
that is under the Sun,
Is to lie by the Barrel
and see the Tap run.
Ratting a rue etc.
But when we had Drunken
two Bottles of Wine,
I found my Dear Mistress
both Loving and Kind.
Ratting a rue, etc.
I tipped her a VVenk,
and backward she fell,
And twenty weeks after
her Belly did swell.
Ratting a rue, etc.
And twenty weeks after
she sat down and cried,
It Is this I have gotten
by strydling so wide.
Ratting a Rue.
Ratting a Rue re-rew re-rew re-rew,
Ratting a Rue re-rew re rue re-rew,
Fa re rue re rue re-reen,
Fa re rue re rue re reen,
Hay bew Hoi baen;
Ratting a Rue.
