The downfall of the CHANCERY. OR, The Lawyers Lamentation.
FArewell Lords Commissioners,
Your Hon'r lies a bleeding,
Enjoin the House (if you can)
To stay their proceeding:
The Chancery's voted down,
Well may your good Lordships frown,
And take up this sad tone,
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell Master of the Rolls
You must be outed,
The house of Lenthals is
All-to-be-routed:
Jack and Will. fat Knaves be,
And full of iniquity,
Take 'em Committees to you.
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell the six Clerks too,
Your Pride is falling,
You must go cast about,
For a new Calling:
Humbly complain ye may,
But it is in vain to pray,
For you are sure to have Nay.
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell the Registers,
(A sad Dismission)
You no more bribes must take
For Expedition;
Farewell the Examiners too,
Your which, when, where, and how,
Will get you little now.
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell that Goblin thing
Called a Sub poena,
The hob-nail'd Country Clown,
Knows what I mean-a:
Over Mountain, over Bog,
The poor Bumkins this made jog,
Oh 'twas a dreadful Pugg!
Ohone, Ohone.
Adieu, adieu, to Law,
And Equity too:
Alas poor Gownmen now
What will ye do?
You must even truckle it to
The holy militant Crew,
Marry, and a good shift too,
Ohone, Ohone.
Like old Alm'nacks you will look,
When there is no pleading,
Or like the poor Cancelled Peers,
(Titles are fading:)
When the Clients at your tail,
And the good Angels fail,
You may bid the Squire farewell.
Ohone, Ohone.
To Long-lane with your robes
If you are wise,
And sell the Cooks your Books
To put under Pies:
What need ye Littleton,
Or the thing called a Gown,
Now your Trade's going down?
Ohone, Ohone.
You had best turn Gifted-men,
For you are long winded,
And can cant Gospel too,
If you are so minded:
Unless you preach or fight,
And practice the new light,
Your Worships may go shite.
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell the learned Cook,
And his Reports,
He Will be of small account
When there is no Courts:
Iohn-a-Nokes may well look pale,
He Will lose his Manor of Dale,
The sword will cut of the Intayl,
Ohone, Ohone.
What will grim Bradshaw do,
His hopes are routed?
To little purpose now,
His noddleships mooted,
(His face and name suit well,
Black as the Prince of Hell,)
He may bid the long robe farewell.
Ohone, Ohone.
What will Post Pride -- do now,
That pamperd Saint,
His greedy stomach must
Suffer a long Lent:
Shortly perhaps he will rue,
That he ere Church Lands knew,
(Good Devil take your due.)
Ohone, Ohone.
What will young Keble do,
When his Lord Sire
Is put besides his place?
(Alas poor Squire!)
He Will find the case altered,
His breath will scarce get bread,
To put in his Fools head.
Ohone, Ohone.
What will old Marriot do
When there is no motions?
His Belly'll grumble sure,
And raise commotions:
Every fart he lets fly,
Could it but speak, would cry,
Hang up the Soldiery.
Ohone, Ohone.
What will poor Scribes do now
For want of money?
They must live chaste perforce,
No Coin, no Coney:
The Goose quill goes to wrack,
This will make Bawds to crack,
Their trading will grow slack.
Ohone, Ohone.
Farewell good dish and dash,
No more long Scribles;
Howl and lament ye Whores,
And strain your Trebbles,
To such a doleful height,
That it may move the State,
To pity your sad Estate.
Ohone, Ohone.
FINIS.
