The Courageous Plowman, or, The Citizens Misfortune.
Being an encouragement to all Plow-men, to exercise themselves in their Youth
with a Cudgel, that they may the better know how to handle a sharper weapon, if
need require.

I shall not stand the Subject to repeat,
Because the Verses do it so complete,
To hear how meekly the Citizens came off,
I think it cannot choose but make you laugh;
The Parties here I must forbear to name,
For fear the Author chance to bear the blame.
To the Tune of, Dick and Nan, Or, The Tyrant.




THere was a brave Citizen
walked forth of late,
From London toth' Country
to choose him a mate;
His Eloquent Complements
and his success
To you in these Verses
I Will plainly express.
He then was attired
handsome and neat,
In a Suit and a Cloak
and a Beaver complete;
In his pockets he had
twenty pieees of Gold,
Which he had provided
to make himself bold.
He then took his journey
to Nottingham Town,
And there he alighted
and brank at the Crown;
Whereas a young Damosel
appeared in his sight,
Which caused the Young Man
to tarry all night.
Citizen. With Eloquent speeches
he thus did begin;
Fair Lady could I but
your favor now win:
If you grant me your love
that is the thing I des;ire,
By reason my heart with love
is set on fire.

Maid. It Is strange quoth the Maiden
love should be so hot;
Such love I Am persuaded
will soon be forgot;
But I wish that the heat thereof
might be asswag'd,
For I to another am
deeply in^ag'd.

Citizen. There Is no man on earth that
shall sever us twain;
If thou will but yield for
to love me again.
And I for thy sake now
will venture my life
My reason I purpose
to make thee my wife.

Plowman. Then came in a Plowman
and heard him say so:
It Is well spoken (quoth he)
but I know what I know;
To tell you the truth Sir,
the Girl is mine,
And if thou can win her
then she shall be thine.
Let us take two weapons
and go into the field,
And never give out until.
one of us yield;
It shall not be spoken
upon an Ale-bench,
That a Plowman was fearful
to fight for a Wench.

Citizen. Art thou so audacious
to dare me to fight?
I Will make thee an example
before it be night:
Thou art but a Bumpkin
bred at the Plow-tail,
And never used no weapon
but only thy Flail.


Therefore be thou trudging
and stand not to prate,
Lest I with this Flaggon,
knock thee on the pate;
Except thou art willing
to stand to thy words,
Then our controversy
we'll end with our Swords.

All things then provided
this Combat began,
They both tried their valors
which was the best man;
They fought half an hour
as people do say,
Yet none knew which would
be beaten that day.
The Plowman most bravely
himself did behave,
By tracing the ground, that
himself he did save;
At last he with fury
laid on such a stroke,
With the strength of his arm,
that his weapon it broke.
He then closed within him
and gave him the fall;
Oh now quoth the Plowman,
you shall pay for all:
I Will make you acknowledge
before you depart,
That a Plowman will fight
ere he will lose his Sweetheart.
O hold thy hand Plowman,
pe^cavi I cry,
O let me not here in
a strange Country die;
Take my gold, cloak, and rapier
and all that I have,
The Damosel's thy own
if my life thou will save.
The Plowman obtained
the conquest that day,
And twenty Gold pieces
he carried away:
He furnished his pockets,
his back and his side,
and gained him a Damosel
to make him a Bride.
The Cockney with sorrow
lamented his loss,
And home he returned
but by weeping Cross:
His mother these Verses
at leisure may read,
And give him good counsel
to take beter heed.
Concluding my Ditty
I thus make an end,
I wish some honest Plowman
would now stand my friend,
And give me some liquor
for I am very dry,
If I tell you the truth
then I tell no lie.
Whoop Cockney, where is your twenty Pound?
Finis.
