A MITE from Three MOURNERS: In MEMORIAL of THOMAS GLASS, a Pattern of Faith
and Patience in the Churches, naturally caring for their state, who died in the
Lord, the 30th day of the Seventh Month, 1666. being the same day twelvemonth
that the beloved John Wiggan (his Fellow Laborer, and Witness to the Cause of
Christ) was taken from the evil to come.
AN ACROSTICK.
The Glass that ran so well, is now run out:
Hark slumbring Virgins, hark to know the reason!
O haste to trim your Lamps; look well about:
Many are foolish, and will slip their season.
Amazing Midnights Cry, is sure at hand;
Such as have Oil in Vessels with their Lamps, Mat. 25.
Go meet him as your Bridegrooms chosen Band;
Lift up your Heads: though foolish, filled with damps,
Alas cry out, Pray give us of your store;
Sent are to buy, but find Shops ope' no more:
Sinners have also reason to weep sore.
J pray the Church this instant may improve
Unto the end revealed from above. Jer. 18.7, 8.
AN ANAGRAM.
Thomas Glass: Glass as Moth.
GLass as a Moth's now crushed, returned to dust;
A brittle thing, not to be leaned upon:
The will of God herein is done, and just,
Though for a time he brightly through him shon,
To great refreshment of his Heritage,
Amidst this hot, weak, weary, tyring day;
Making them wish, and ready to presage,
That he amongst them might much longer stay.
So fitted, furnished for Gods work was he,
In which he labored, during heat and cold,
And therein did obtain a good degree,
In bearing up for God a Witness bold.
But ah! how different are our thoughts and ways
From God our Lord's, that are so far above?
That Paths pursuant most unto his Praise,
At first we seldom see, choose, like or love.

An ELEGY.
MY Heart with grief and pain is pressed,
As overcharged in my Breast:
Its struglings of a diverse kind,
Perplex and intricate my Mind:
Confused Entanglement appears,
Of Sense, with Faith; of Hopes, with Fears:
Vicissitudes of Up's and Down's;
Of Smiles, that interfere with Frowns;
As Twins that mutually contend.
