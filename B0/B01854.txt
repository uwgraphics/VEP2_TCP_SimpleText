May the 25. 16^^.
To the Supreme Au^^^^ity (...) ^^^^tion, the Parliam^^^^ (...) The humble
Petition of Edward Bullock Gentle^^^, an Inhabitant of New England.
SHOWS,
THat Tho: Bullock your Petitioners Uncle being seized of two Manors to him
and his heirs males for ever, viz. the Manor of Arbeifeld and the Manor of
Barkham, and diverse other Lands lying in the County of Berk of the yearly value
of 800. l. or thereabout, the timber growing then upon the said lands being
worth 10000. l. and upwards. And the said Tho: Bullock above 70. years since
mortgaged all the said lands to one Master Edmund-Standen for 4000. l. with a
full power of Redemption, (as by the Deed of Mortgage appears.) And your Pet.
further shows, That the said Tho: Bullock shortly after dyed, leaving the
redemption of the said Lands unto his Brother William Bullock your Pet. Father,
who was Heir at Law to the said Thomas. Whereupon Will: Bullock exhibited a
Bill in Chancery against the said Standen, whilst Edgerton was Lo: Keeper: but
the said Standen being powerful with the said Lo: Keeper, upon Bill and Answer
obtained a Decree or Order in ratifioation of the said Mortgage, without paying
any more money for the said Lands, though it was then well known the Lands and
Timber growing thereupon, were worth above 20000. l. more then they were
mortgaged for. And your Pet. farther shows, That the said Will: Bullock his
Father was committed to the Fleet, and there remained a Prisoner by the space
of five years, merely for speaking in his own Cause at the time of Hearing,
which was to the ruin of him, his wife and ten children then living.
Afterward Will: Bullock dyed and left four sons living, viz. Thomas, William,
your Petitioner Edward, and F^eet. Thomas and Will: dyed without issue, so that
your Pet. is now Heir at Law, and has the only equitable interest for
redemption of the said Lands. And your Pet. further shows, that the said
Edmund Standen long since dyed, leaving all the said mortgaged lands to one
William Standen Esquire his only child, who about ten years since dyed without
issue. But so it is, (^^^y it please this Honorable Assembly) that one William
Sp^^d^n laid Citizen and (...) of London, has gotten into the possession of
all the said mortgaged lands, insisting upon the validity of the said D^^^^^ or
Order, resol^ing to hold the lands against your Pet. having the present
advantage of all the rents and profits of the said lands, being now worth 1000.
l. per ann. or thereabouts.

Now forasmuch as your Pet, (an inhabitant of New England) receiving
encouragement by several eminent acts of Justice to others of the like nature
to attend this Honorable Assembly for ^^^^^fe against that corrupt Decree or
Order made by the said Lo: Keeper in behalf of the said Standen.

Your Pet. humbly implores this honorable Assembly, That the whole proceedings
touching the obtaining of the said Decree or Order, together with all the foul
and corrupt practices therein may be referred to the examination of a Committee
of P^rl. That so your Pet. may at length by the justice of this renowned P^^l*
be restored to the due inheritance of his Ancestors of more than 500. years
standing, in possession. And your Pet. shall not only submit to what your
Honors shall think equal and just, but

He and his Fathers house shall pray, etc. Edward Bullock.

suggested) does not on any point or clause instance one tittle of a Morgage of

Morgage; but the said Decree made by the aforesaid Lord Keeper, by, and with
the assistance of Sir John Popham Knight, chief Justice of the Queens Bench,

Redemption] and to tha^ end the said William Bullock suborned, and endeavored
to suborne Evidence, or Witnesses; and for forging, or feining of the Lease
aforesaid, and for other his notorious practices, the said William Bullock was
