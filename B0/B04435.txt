ON the Death of his Grace JOHN DUKE of ROTHES, LORD High CHANCELLOR of
SCOTLAND, etc.
ELEGY.
ISRAEL for Moses forty days did Mourn,
Our Joy to Grief, twice forty days may turn;
Scotlands Conductor, ROTHES, Wise and Brave,
Ah! now Himself Conducted is to Grave:
ROTHES did Rule our Helm in Storms, and Grace
The Halcyon Calmness of our Oceans Peace:
Dread Comet, ah! too dreadful not in vain.
Fatal to Albions Pole, and Charles his Wain;
Judicious DVKE, able to quench all Jarrs,
On which may rise Uncivil, Civil Wars,
Most prudent Statesman, Sage to Reconceal,
Knowing thy Kings Will, was the Kingdoms Well,
In Court, in Camp, in City, Field, or Town;
Worthy to bear a Batton or a Gown.
No Fate could make thy Loyalty relent:
Nor Bondage of thy long Imprisonment;
Give Thou then Grieved, it was that then the while
Thou could not Serve thy Master in Exyle;
Yet there Thy Thoughts, and Corrospondence too,
Acted the most a Prisoner could do;
Yet never Winter made of Summer, more
Joyful to Thee, when Heavens did Him Restore:
And made Thy Self after a long Restraint:
A Vigorous, and most Active Instrument,
For which, Thou did Thy Monarchs Love Inherit,
The due Reward of Thy Desert and Merit;
A Love most Firm, and Great, to be Admired,
But Changed to Sorrow, since Thy Breath expyr'd.
Great DVKE, Lord Chancellor, General, Thesaurer,
His Majesty's most High Commissioner.
What Greatness could Thou Want, Thy King could Give,
Who only in Thy Destiny did Grieve;
He Could not also give Thee long to Live.
Yet, since Heavens Doom, no Flesh from Death reprives;
You Are Mourned by Scotlands Representatives;
Thy Death makes York, our High Commissioner Sad:
He, even more High, then ere our Nation had.
To Pen Thy Praise, exceeds all Poets Skill;
And does require Apollo's Choicest Quill;
Sure then Thy Name great Honor does obtain,
To whom the Highest Praises are but Mean.
Then Blessed are You Celestial Minds that move,
Uncessantly the Spacious Orbs Above;
For if Your Toil prove Irksome, You may Rest,
And Trust Your work to this New Heavenly Guest.
M. M.
