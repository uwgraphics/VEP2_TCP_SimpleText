His Majesty's MOST GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. On Thursday
the Fourth Day of May, 1699.
My Lords and Gentlemen,

You have now Sat so many Months, that the Season of the Year, as well as your
particular Affairs, make it reasonable you should have a Recess; I take it for
granted you have Finished all the Bills which for the present you think
Requisite to be Passed into Laws, and I have given My Assent to all You have
Presented to Me.

If any thing shall be found Wanting for Our Safety, the Support of Public
Credit by making good the Faith of the Kingdom as it stands Engaged by
Parliamentary Securities, and for Discharge of the Debts Occasioned by the War,
or toward the Advancing of Trade, the Suppressing of Vice, and the Employing
of the Poor, which were all the things I Proposed to your Consideration when We
met first, I cannot doubt but effectual Care will be taken of them next Winter;
and I wish no Inconvenience may happen in the mean time.

Then the Lord Chancellor, by His Majesty's, Command, said, My Lords and
Gentlemen, Thursday the First Day of June next; And this Parliament is
Prorogued accordingly, to Thursday the First Day of June next.

Edinburgh, Reprinted by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer
to the Kings most Excellent Majesty. 1699.
