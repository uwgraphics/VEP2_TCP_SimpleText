An easy way to Tame a SHREW.
OR THE Young Plow-man's Frollick.
He that a Shrew would gladly Tame,
Example take here by the same;
As in this Ditty you may find,
Fair words does please a Woman's mind:
And all good Wives where e're you be,
Pray listen well to this Ditty;
To please you all I know not how,
But yet I say, God speed the Plow.
To a Delightful New Tune; Or, The Collier of Croydon had Coals to sell.




BE merry all you that be here,
here present in this place,
And with a Song I will you please,
as God shall give me Grace;
Then give ear a little space.
A Young Man lived in our Country,
which of late did set up Plow,
He wanted strength to Till his ground,
he had but Horses two:
Alack what could he do:
He got up early in the morning,
because he fain would thrive,
He went but fairly with his Draught,
and he hired a Boy to drive;
You shall hear more believe.
Then an aged man came riding by,
of him he did not dream,
He did commend his Plowing well,
with such a slender Team;
For he wanted but a Beam.
I have a Horse, the old man said,
so furious and void of fear,
No work nor beating can him tame,
for he breaks all our Gears,
Attend all you that hear.
I can him tame, the young man said,
if you will sell him me,
The old man replied, the grief is small,
then soon they did agree;
His proof I fain would see.
He tied this Horse up two or three days,
to tame his sturdy fit,
He gave him gentle words enough,
but meat never a bit;
Thus he did try his wit.
And then he brings him forth to work,
and in the midst he goes,
He takes a bottle of his best Hay,
and he hangs it before his Nose;
He drew then you may suppose.
And as he drew he gave him some,
so brought him to good frame,
The aged man within few days,
did come to see the same;
What said he when he came?
Thou sure have done a mighty feat,
for I could never bring
Him to Saddle nor to draw,
thou have conquered like a King;
I but hunger did the thing.
The second part,
to the same Tune.
SHOWING, How the Old Man married his Daughter to this Young Man.

And how the Young Man dealt with his Cross-grained Wife,
Yet after lived a sweet Contented Life.
I have a daughter, the old man said,
my Heir and only child,
But in condition she is a Shrew,
both sturdy, stout, and wild;
Her nature is not mild.
If thou wilt but please to marry her,
her Portion is not small,
Five hundred pound I thee will give,
and when I dye she shall have all;
What ever does befall.
I Will see your daughter, the young man said,
if I can but favor find,
I make no doubt to bring it about,
to win her to my mind;
And i will to her prove kind.
But when he to this Damosel came,
as plainly does appear,
She liked him, and loved him so,
they quickly married were;
What followed you shall hear.
Next morning early he got up,
and for to go to the Plow,
Then with speeches fair, he did prepare,
to tell her what to do;
Then he came his Wife unto.
Then he brought unto her Chamber door
a Wheel, and Flax to Spin,
And said, good Wife, with our own hands
our living we must win,
Oh in time he did begin.
I will not work at all, quoth she,
my portion is so great,
Nay, you must work good wife, he said,
or nothing you must eat;
This was his subtle feat.
No meat at all she had that day,
for out she could not get,
He locked the door and went to Plow,
and left her there to fret;
But she did not dye o'th Pet.
At night when he came home from Plow,
he proffered her a Kiss,
Nay Churl said she, away be gone,
I will tell my Parents this;
Then he thought all was amiss.
Next morning her Wheel she took in hand
and spun up eight good Lease,
And said, kind Husband, by all means,
I will seek your mind to please;
Oh then she found better ease.
But when her Parents they did come,
to see how they did agree,
They found her busy at her work,
and singing merrily;
They wondered that to see.
My Husband loves me well, said she,
I have any thing I crave,
But I must work as well as he,
or nothing I must have;
I must either gain or save.
We be hungry daughter, they said,
will you give us some meat?
Nay you must work before, said she,
or nothing you must eat;
She had learned the subtle feat.
But when her husband he came home,
and found her Parents there,
He made them welcome heartily,
he laughed and made good Cheer;
Oh then they merry were.
thus you have heard the tameing of a shrew
by gentle means, and how
Then all good wives, while you have lives
help to maintain the Plow;
And it will you means allow.
FINIS.
