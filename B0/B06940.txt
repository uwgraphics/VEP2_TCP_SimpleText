A NEW PRESBYTERIAN BALLAD,
To the old Tune of, The clean contrary way.
1.
(...) Whiggs, our Senat's gone,
(...) Our Glory's now a setting:
(...) with Plot's laid at our door,
(...) of our getting:
(...) bloody Cheats, and Shifts and Tricks,
(...) all our Devilish Play
(...) be disclosed and we proved saints
The clean contrary way.
2.
(...) will discovered be,
(...) ^ltry purjur'd stuff,
(...) the Hellish Plotters, that
(...) such Hell-hound-Proof:
(...) the face to guild their Vice,
(...) them like Saints display,
(...) wheedled them to swear the Truth
The clean contrary way.
3.
We made their piteous Nonsense good,
And Contradictions true,
(...) relisht their unlikely Tales,
So blundering like blind Hugh.
What cared we, if they damned themselves?
(...) we obtained the day,
(...) meritorious make our work
The clear contrary way.
4.
(...) did scruple to believe
^^ings, so absurd to Reason;
(...) ^^^^ed Reasons Balance, and
We still cried, Treason, Treason;
When the Informers halted had
Our hubbubs bore the sway,
^^ighting folks into their wits,
The clean contrary way.
5.
(...) we racked for Evidence,
(...) that search in Ditches,
(...) some holes for poisonous Toads,
And hungry sucking Leeches:
We gulled Fitz-harris for more guile,
The guitless to betray:
For which he will reap a sweet reward
The clean contrary way.
6.
(...) the Papists Traitors all,
(...) none the Snare might escape,
(...) all the Royal Protestants
(...) the Tra^:
(...) be (...),
What ever they do or say
(...) wishers to the Pope
The clean contrary way.
7.
The Realms Religion, that is by Law
In its Establishment,
We made as if afraid to lose,
Though from it we dissent;
The Church of England in the dust
That level we would lay
To show our selves true Protestants
The clean contrary way.
8.
The long-black-rebel-Parliament
We stood to vindicate,
We blossomed new in th'good Old Cause
Of Commonweath and State;
Yet Monmouths Duke cried ^y the while
And used him like a Toy
A future Monarch he is designed,
The clean contrary way.
9.
'Twas such, as we, for Charles the first,
With many a Prtoestati^^
His Glory did so much pretend,
His Weal and Preservation;
But drew the sword against his Friends,
And forced them all away,
And him forlorn they did preserve,
The clean contrary way.
10.
It Was such, as we, the second Charles
Did scornfully disown,
Called him the Common Enemy
Debarred him from his Throne:
Who now, but we, cry out of Plots,
And for his safety pray,
And stand up stout in his defense
The clean contrary way.
11.
It Was such, as we, in Scotland late
Twice actually Rebel'd,
And (Maugre all the Mercy here)
Our English venom swelled:
We to Oblivions act so kind
Unkind Oblivion pay
Like cherisht Vipers yielding thanks,
The clean contrary way.
12.
Yet we assumed the confidence
Tho conscious of what is past,
To busy our Petitions bold,
So frequent and so fast:
Instead of Blessed, we Blasted are,
Alack and well aday!
And we henceforth shall trusted be
The clean contrary way.
Printed in the Year, 1681.
