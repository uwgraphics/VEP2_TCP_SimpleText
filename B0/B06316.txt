The two Lymas Lovers, Thomas and Betty.
Set forth in a Dialogue between them at his Departure.
Although they part, yet still his Heart
was true, he loved her dear.
And likewise she in Loyalty,
did perfectly appear,
Tune of, O so so ungrateful a Creature,
This may be Printed.

R. P.







FAirest of Creatures I leave thee,
now for a Twelve month or more,
Yet I will never deceive thee,
but will thy blessings restore;
When I return from the Ocean,
Gold I will bring to my dear,
For my sweet Jewels promotion,
there is no Perils i will fear.
Surely thy words they are ki^ling,
which to my sorrow I hear,
Never was Maid more unwi^ling,
than I to part with my dear,
Why will thou hazard the dangers,
of the Tempestious Seas,
With the abuses of Strangers,
when thou might live at thy ease.
Why should those dangers affright us,
Seamen must never be dismayed
There is nothing can delight us,
more then a prosperous Trade:
Sailing from Nation to Nation,
traveling Seamen behold,
Wonderful Works of Creation,
bring home the Indian Gold.




Why do thou tell me of treasure?
threaten me that thou will roam,
Can I possess greater pleasure,
then to embrace thee at home?
O that I might but enjoy thee,
it is what thy true-lover craves,
Here there is none can annoy thee,
no not the turbulent Waves.
What though a while we are parted?
heaven still will be my guide,
Why should I then be faint hearted?
since there is many beside,
Captain, with valliant stout Seamen,
Bowson with all the whole Crew,
Married Men as well as Freemen,
Fears not what Tempests can do.
Dearest thy language does grieve me,
being surrounded with fears,
Have thou the power to leave me,
drowned with sorrowful tears?
When I consider my Jewel,
whom I so dearly adore,
Meet with those Billows so cruel,
where I shall see him no more.
Love, when most terrible thunder,
causes a Tempest to rise,
Tearing your Rigging asunder,
^ost between Billows and Skies.
Weeping alas! must relieve me,
while thou art Sailing the Sea,
Nothing in nature does grieve me,
more than the parting with thee,
Prithee be patient my Sweeting,
let nothing trouble thy mind,
There will be joy in next meeting,
thou shall asuredly find,
When I return you shall flourish,
Jewels to thee I will give,
And in my Arms I will nourish.
my Love as long as I live.
No one but thee I will Marry,
whom I do dearly adore,
Tho I no longer can carry
with thee my Jewel on Shore:
Let it be still thy endeavor,
truly contented to be,
Tho for a while we must sever,
I will be Loyal to thee.
Seeing we must be divided,
and that thou will have thy will,
May you by Blessings be guided,
thus I shall pray for thee still:
That nothing may e're anoy thee,
while thou come safe to the Shore,
Love I shall long to enjoy thee,
and to behold thee once more.
Printed for I. Deacon, at the Angel in Gilt spur-street.
