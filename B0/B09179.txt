A Ballad on the Giants in the Physic Garden in OXFORD, who have been breeding
feet as long as Garagantua was Teeth.
To the Tune of the Counter Scuffle.
WHat is our Oxford Africa?
It teemeth Monsters every day
About East-bridge which is the way
To Whately.
In Boberts Garden there are two,
Which lately had nor foot nor shoo,
Which now have both in public view
most stately.
That these are Giants you may guess,
Byth' Foot as well as Hercules,
And as by Tallons nothing less
Than the Lion.
They Are Grimme as any dog of Hell,
Though heads so many we cant tell,
For only two (and yet that is well)
We spy on.
Two heads are better far then one
In any Consultation,
But these don't join but fix like stone,
Their Noddles.
They speak by Figures or by signs
Without Communication lines,
Or any Books of deep Divines
New Moddles.
Without th'Library or the place
At the South Port, where Bacons Face
A Friar of our English Race
Did venture.
On that men call, bless us! Black Art,
By which he made the clowns to start,
And drove some of them with a F --
To th'Center.
This Roger (so his Forename shows)
These heads did make, with Copper Nose
And taught them language that out goes
Our knowledge.
But how I wonder came their Feet
So green, so great, so thick, so neat
A hundred come them for to greet
From College.
Nay one from Ricot of late days
Who among the Peers may wear the Bays
These verdant Gallants to their praise
Did visit.
Whereby these Giants credit got
And he that late the Poem wrote,
But it is (...) Ballad, is it not?
Who Will miss it.
Our Giants are familiar
With Simpling Tribe, and minister
The Plant, Tres-humble Serviteur.
And Physic
Of Agrimony, Sage, and Rue
And garden Rhabarb, Dosed true,
If (...)
By (...)
They guard a Book full of such Plants
And fright out snailes, locusts, and Ants
And any vermin foul that haunts
These places.
Apples they do preserve as good,
As in Hesperian Orchard stood,
Which make Lambs-wooll (...)
^
All sorts of Cherries do grow here,
And strawberries frequent appear,
Conceive I pray at time oth' year,
For Winter
As well as Time, will nip sweet Face
And spoil those Colors Ladys Grace
When that Grim fire does set his Mace
Or Print there.
Here Is medc'nall herbs for Galenists,
Not powders for our new Chemists
Who are lame Vulcans fiery Priests
And hammer
Spirits out of the simple leaves
And vigorous dust, which Jesuit gives
Far worse the patient often receives
From's Gammer.
Alders-gate street does not afford
Such heaps of herbs for bed, or board,
Nor piles of Sallats, sawces stored
For belly,
Nor Westminster, nor yet the Strand
Nor any Garden of the Land
Such herbs as come through Jacobs hand
Can sell ye.
Besides the Marvells of Peru,
Of most delicious various hue
No Painter can with pencill do
Such colors.
There Is stemms of Alo's like Whale-bone,
And teeth like Sword-fish every one,
Yet never yet hurt any one
Oth' Scholars:
For Jacob and his Giants will
Not suffer any thing that is ill
(Unless it be for purge or pill)
There growing,
For all the plants are of his pains,
He diggs, he setts, but heaven raines
But alas! he has but little gains
For's Sowing.
There is a youth called little Jack
That shall with working break his back
(Unless his breakfast he do lack)
He Will muck it
Like any plowman in the field
Until the ground her fruit do yield,
So often with water has he filled
His Bucket.
What would you more then Giants high
Forbear ye to approach too nigh,
You Will fright the Lady Dulciny
TO BOSO.
And yet that Lady has a Knight
That will drink w^ ^hen he should li^
(...) his might
To do so.
To all adventures dangerous,
As the Mill nigh can tell to us,
This Knight w^^^ some times ficrcely rush
And's Man stern
There Is no av^^ding of that Knight,
^
^
(...) Lantern.
Not Faux-like on a black design
To mirth he only does incline
and has a Page, if no Moon shine,
Attending
For he will not carry coals nor light
Nor yet his Squire, who goes upright
But yet they are for any wight
Defending
Or injured Lady, or Fleeced sheep
Good lack what Racket they do keep
And never Eat, nor Drink, nor Sleep
Till Giant,
And one-eyd Monsters humbled are
Unto their feet, which smell most rare,
With making constant Fewd, and war
o Fie on it!
What though these Giants harnest be
Completely too, That Is Cap a Pe,
And can with Feet deal lustily
In boxes.
Yet Don Quixot is armed also
With brass helmet of Mambrino
He Will suffer them no harm to do
To's doxes:
So that it is prudence to induce
The Knight and Giants to a Truce,
That we the Garden still may use
In quiet,
And drink what springs from Scurvy gras
(Without making a scurvy face,)
So shall we keep this pleasant place
From Riot
And filthy Routs which spoil soft joys,
The sports of the mad Girls, and Boys,
When they are in their merry Toys
And Ranting
But Bobert is a sober soul
And watches like an Athens Oule
To see of mirth no lawful jowle
Be wanting.
But if the Poet, as is meet,
For these his pains you do not greet
He thus takes penance in a sheet
To please you.
In Print when he does next appear
He hopes to make it plain and clear
That of your Melancholy fear
He Will ease you,
If not he will lay another gin
And try to catch you once therein
To put you on a merry pin
And jolly:
If then he fails his Badger rimes
Shall to the tune of Carfax Chimes.
Sing Naught ^^^l please the present times
But Folly.
FINIS. 1662
