THE Trappand Cuckold-maker. OR, Yea-and-Nay well fitted.
A Baker went with full intent,
a Beauty to adore;
Thus Yea and Nay, did run astray,
But he will do so no more.
Tune is, O Mother Roger, etc.
This may be Printed,

THere was of late a Cuckold-maker,
if you will believe the truth;
Yea and nay, he was a Quaker,
yet he used the tricks of youth.
On a day it chanced so.
He would to his Neighbor go,
When her Husband want within,
This discourse he did begin,
Saying, if thou will me obey,
I Will tender thee by yea and nay.
Love let me have my Hearts desire,
wherefore should thou say me nay;
Beauty sets my Heart on fire,
little Lambs thou know will play:
Since I have my love revealed,
Prithee dearest do but yield,
I will be a constant friend,
When I cannot come I Will send,
Thee many presents, day by day,
And love thee too by yea and nay.
The Woman then with modest blushes,
in a passion she reviled;
But the Quaker often Hushes,
her, to be more kind and mild:
Thus he whisp^rs ^n her Ear,
Tush, said he, thou needst not fear,
Any manner of disgrace,
We may freely here embrace:
Then prithee make no more delay,
I love thee well by yea and nay.
Thus he endeavored to delude her,
but she answered him, and said,
Never was a Man more ruder,
yet I will not be betrayed
To your humors, no not I,
Therefore make no more reply,
Then he caught her in his arms,
Saying, those alluring charms,
My heart and senses does betray,
I love thee well by yea and nay.
She found he would not be contented,
no denial would he take,
Therefore she a Trick invented,
and to him she thus did speak;
If I do commit this Crime,
It must be some other time,
Come to me too morrow night,
Thou shall have thy Hearts delight;
I will be sure, he then did say
To come, my dear, by yea and nay
He thought she had the truth related,
seeing she had told him when;
Therefore home he went and waited,
thinking every hour ten,
To her Husband she did tell,
Every thing that had befell;
Now when she had this declared,
For his coming they prepared.
As you shall hear: then listen pray,
They were too hard for yea and nay.
Now when the hour was expired,
to her Chamber then he came,
To enjoy what he desired,
of this fair and comely Dame,
When he was come in the room,
Presently he did presume
To embrace the Beauty fair,
Thinking no one had been there,
Her Husband rushing in straightway,
Alas! this daunted yea and nay.
The good man vowed he would not take it
she had left him in the lurch,
Yea and nay was almost naked,
when with two stout rods of Birch.
He did lash both Legs and Hips,
Round the room he ^ips and skips,
With his sad and mournful Cries,
Tears they trickle from his Eyes.
O pardon me good Sir, I pray,
I Will come no more by yea and nay.
O why should thou thy Heart so harden:
let some pity now be found,
Giving me thy gracious pardon,
here I Will give thee thirty pound;
Tho I once have done amiss,
Do not tell the World of this:
If I pardon you therefore,
See you tempt my Wife no more.
The ready money he did pay,
He would not trust poor yea and nay.
FINIS.
