The woeful lamentation of Edward Smith, a poor penitent prisoner in the Iayle
of Bedford, which he wrote a short time before his death.
To the tune of, Dainty come thou to me.
I Am a Prisoner poor
Oppressed with misery:
O Lord do thou restore,
that faith which wants in me.
In woe I wail and weep,
In griping grief I cry,
In dungeon dark and deep,
In fetters fast I lie
Sighing I sit and moan
My foul offenses all,
My loathsome life is known,
which makes me live in thrall
Ned ^mith I am, the wight
In prison that remains,
Tormented day and night,
with bands and iron chains.
My joys are turned to naught,
My hopes are worn away,
My wickedness has wrought
my downe-fall and decay.
Those gifts that God gave me,
My wants for to supply,
Abused much I have.
to please my fantasy.
My name I did deny,
In Baptism given me,
That Sacrament whereby
regenerate I should be.
No wit nor strength may serve
The Law to satisfy:
For death I do deserve,
in right and equity.
For I offended have
Nobles of hie degree,
What favor can I crave
for life or liberty.
But hope of life is past,
My acts so heinous be.
And liberty is lost,
till death do set me free.
All men both old and young
Which are at liberty,
And hear my doleful song.
example take by me.
Be true and trust in God,
Fly theft and vice eschew,
Lest Gods most heavy rod,
correct your deeds untrue.
Would I had nere bin borne
To do such wicked deeds,
Which makes me live in scorn
and shame that sore exceeds.
But that which passed is,
I cannot now recall:
My sins and my amiss,
O Lord forgive them all.
Woe worth ill company,
Fie on that filthy crew:
Accursed the day may be
that ever I them knew.
If life and death were set
Before me for to chose,
Though I might pardon get,
my life first would I lose,
Then run that wicked race,
And do as I have done,
Sweet Jesus give me grace,
that life so lewd to shun.
Farewell my loving wife
Who sought to turn my mind,
And make me mend my life,
thy words full true I find.
Farewell my children all,
My tender Babes adue:
Let this your Fathers fall,
be warning good for you.
Dear wife and infants three,
Serve God remember this,
That you true subjects be,
though I have done amiss.
Farewell my music sweet,
And Cittorn silver sound,
Mourning for me is meet
my sins do so abound.
O Lord on bended knees
And hands lift up on hie,
Cast on me gracious eyes
with grace my wants supply
Lay not unto my charge,
The things that I have done,
Though I have run at large,
and played the unthrift son.
Yet now I do repent,
And humbly come to thee
My sins I do lament,
sweet Jesus comfort me.
O Lord I do Lament,
And only joy in thee,
To praise thee day and night,
for thou redeemedst me.
Lord save our royal King
Whose prisoner poor am I,
Prolong his days on earth,
with fame and victory.
Against his Majesty,
I have offended sore,
Committing Felony,
and now I die therefore.
A doleful death God knows,
Which once I did defy:
Thus must I end my woes
which I take patiently,
By thee O Savior sweet,
In heaven I hope to rest,
In joy where I shall meet,
those fowls whom thou have blessed
Where we shall sing thy praise,
O God, with voice high,
When I shall end my days,
and live eternally.
FINIS.
