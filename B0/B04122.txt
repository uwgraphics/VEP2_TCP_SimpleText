A Lamentable ballad of the tragical end of a Gallant Lord, and a Virtuous
Lady, with the untimely end of their two children, wickedly performed by a
Heathenish Blackamoor their servant, the like never heard of before.
To the tune of, The Ladies fa^l.


IN Rome a Noble man did wed
a Virgin of great F^me,
(...) fairer Creature never did
Dame Nature ever frame,
By whom he had two children fair,
whose beauty did excel,
They were their Parents only joy
they loved them has so well,
This Lord he lo^^'d to hunt the Buck
the Tiger and the Bear,
And still for swiftness always took
with him a Blackamoore
Which Blackamoor within the wood
his Lord he did offend,
For which he did him then correct
in hope he would amend.
The day it grew unto an end,
then home ward he did ha^^e
Where with his Lady he did rest
until the night was past,
Than in the morning he did rise,
and did his servants call,
A hunting he provided to go
straight they were ready all,
C^use of the toil his Lady did
entreat him not to go,
Alas good Lady then quoth be;
why art thou grieved so;
Content thy self I will return
with speed to thee again,
Good Father quoth the little Babes,
with us here still remain.
Farewell dear children I will go
a fine thing you to buy.
But they therewith nothing content
aloud began to cry.
The Mother takes them by the hand,
saying, come go with me,
Unto the highest tower where
your Father you shall see
The Blackamoore perceiving now
who then did stay behind,
His Lord to be a hunting gone
began to call to mind;
My Master he did me correct,
my fault not being great;
Now of his wife I Will be revenged
she shall not me entreat.
The place was moted round about,
the Bridge he up did draw:
The Gates he bolted very fast
of none in stood in awe.
He up into the tower went
the Lady being there,
Who when she saw his countenance grim
she straight began to fear.
But now my trembling heart it quakes
to think what I must write;
My senses all begin to fail
My soul it does affright.
Yet must I make an end of th^s
which here I have begun:
Which will make sad the hardest heart
before that I have done.
This wretch unto the Lady went
and her with speed did will,
His lust forthwith to satisfy
his mind for to fulfill.
The Lady she amazed was
to hear the Villain speak,
Alas quoth she what shall I do
with grief my heart will break?
With that he took her in his arms
she straight for help did cry,
Content your self Lady he said
your Husband is not nigh.
The bridge is drawn, the gates are s^ut
therefore come lie with me,
Or else I do protest and vow
thy Butcher I will be.
The Crystal tears ran down her face,
her children cried amain:
And sought to help their Mother dear
but all it was in vain.
For that Egregious filthy Rogu^,
her hands behind her bound,
And then perforce with all his might,
he threw her on the ground.
The second part
to the same tune.
WIth that she shrikt, her children cried
and such a noise did make,
The towns-folks hearing her laments,
did see^ their parts to take.
But all in vain no way they found,
to help the Ladies need.
Who cried to them most pitiously
O help, O help with speed.
Some ran unto the Forest wide,
her Lord home for to call,
And they that stood still did lament
this gallant Ladies fall.
With Speed her Lord came passing home
he could not enter in,
His Ladies cries did pierce his heart,
to call he did begin.
O hold thy hand thou Savage Moor,
to hurt her do forbear,
Or else be sure if I do live
wild horses shall thee tear:
With that the Rogue ran to the wall,
he having had his will.
And brought one child under his arm
his dearest blood to spill.
The child seeing his Father there
to him for help did call,
O Father help my Mother dear
we shall be killed all.
Then fell the Lord upon his knee,
and did the Moor entreat,
To save the life of his poor child,
Whose fear as then was great,
But this vile wretch the little child,
by both the heels did take.
And dash the br^ins against the wall,
Whilst Parents hear^ did ache.
That being done straight way he ran
the other child to fetch.
And plucked it from the Mothers breast,
most like a cruel wretch.
Within one hand a knife he brought
the child within another,
And holding it over the wall,
saying, thus dye shall thy Mother:
With that he cut the throat of it,
then to the Father did call,
To look how he the head had cut
then down the head did fall,
This done, he threw it down the wall,
into the Mote so deep,
Which made his Father wring his hands
and grievously to weep.
Then to the Lady went this Rogue,
who was near dead with fear,
Yet this rise wretch most cruelly
did drag her by the hair.
And drew her to the very wall
which when her Lord did see
Then presently he cried out,
and fe^l upon his knee,
Quoth he if thou will save her life
whom I do love so dear.
I will forgive thee all is past,
though they concern me near,
O save her life I thee b^^eech,
O save her I thee pray!
And I will give thee what thou will
demand of me this day.
Well quoth the Moor I do regard
the moan that thou do ma^e,
It thou will grant me what I ask
I Will save her for thy sake.
O save her life and then demand
of me what thing thou will,
Cut off thy nose and not one drop
of her blood shall be spilt.
With that the Lord presently took
a knife within his hand,
And then his nose be quite cut off
in place where he did stand,
N^w have I bought my La^ies life,
then to the Moor did call.
Then take her quoth this wicked rogue
and down he let her fall.
Which when her gallant Lord did see
his senses all did fail
Yet many sought to save her life
but nothing would prevail.
When as the Moor did see him dead,
then did he laugh amain,
At them who for their gallant Lord
and Lady did complain.
Quoth he I know you will torture me
If that you can me get,
But all your threats I do not fear
nor yet regard one whit.
Wild horses shall my body tear,
I know it to be true,
But I Will prevent you of that pain
and down himself be threw,
Too good a death for such a wretch
a Villain void of fear,
And thus does end as sad a tale
as ever man did hear.
Finis.
