Q. What is the evil in the life to come?

A. Everlasting destruction both of body and soul. Romans 6. 21. 23.

Q. Did this guilt and punishment rest in Adam and went no further?

A. It did not rest in him, but spread it self to all his posterity. Romans 5.
12. 13. 14.

Q. What is the scope of this Scripture?

A. To show that the sin of one man's eating the forbidden fruit is the sin
of all men.

Q. Why should the posterity of Adam be guilty of that sin they never did?

A. Because all mankind was in Adams loins when he sinned, as in Abraham Leui
is said to have paid tithes to Melchisedech.

Q. What follows upon this?

A. That by propagation of our last Parents we are partakers of the
transgression of our first Parents. Hitherto of the fall.

Q. What is the repair of man?

A. A restoring of mankind to a far better estate then ever we had in Adam.
Romans 5. 15.

Q. What is the way to recover this estate?

A. Only by faith in the covenant of grace.

Q. How does that appear that faith is the only way?

A. Because the Scripture shows that the Fathers before and under the Law and
Gospel, were by this way of faith and by no other, justified, and saved. Genesis
15. 6. Heb. 13. 8.

Q. To whom does this restoring belong?

A. Only to mankind, and not to the Angels that are fallen.

Q. Why does it not belong also unto them?

A. 1. Because the promise of restoring was made only to man, and not to them.
Genesis 3. 15.

2. Because the restoring was wrought in the nature of man, and not of Angels.
Hebr. 2. 16.

Q. What are the outward means of this restoring?

A. The word of God preached, and the Sacraments rightly administered.

Q. What are the parts of the word?

A. The Law, called the covenant of works.

The Gospel, called the covenant of grace.

Q. What does the Law require?

A. Perfection in all things, which none can do in any thing.

Q. If the Law cannot justify, what use is there of it?

A. Though it cannot justify, yet there is great use of it.

First, to the unregenerate.

1. To discover their sin.

2. To aggrauate and increase it.

3. To pronounce the sentence of death aainst them, and so is a Schoolemaister
to bring them to Christ. Gal. 3. 24.

Secondly, To the regenerate.

1. It is a light to show and direct them how to live aright after they be come
to Christ. Psalm. 119. 105.

2. It does quicken and stir up to obedience.

3. It keeps down the rebellion of the flesh in the best.

Q. What rules are to be observed for the better understanding of the Law?

A. 1. In every commandment there is a figurative speech, whereby more is
commanded or forbidden then is named.

2. In every commandment there be two parts, affirmative and negative, whereof
the one is expressed, and the other understood.

3. Whatsoever every commandment commands or forbids, it commands all
means and occasions thereunto, and forbids the contrary.

4. The Law is spiritual, and therefore is given to rule and order as well the
inward man as the outward.

Q. Why is every commandment set forth in the second person and singular
number, (thou?)

A. That every particular man may know that God speaks to him.

Q. How is the Law divided?

A. Into two Tables, the first and the second. Exodus 34. 1. Deuteronomy. 4. 13.

Q. What is proper to the first Table?

A. 1. That entreats of God and his worship only.

2. The duties and sins of the first Table are greater then the duties and
sins of the second Table, if the comparison be equal, otherwise not.

3. Every commandment of the first Table have their several reasons annexed
unto the^.

Q. Why are the reasons of the commandment of the first Table set down rather
then the second?

A. To show that there is less light left in us of the worship of God, then of
the duties we owe to our neighbor.

Q. What does the second Table teach us?

A. The duties of love and righteousness to our neighbors, both in our
general and particular callings.

Q. What is to be observed from hence, that God has joined these two Tables
together?

A. That in that obedience which is pleasing to God, the duties of both tables
must be joined together, and never severed. 1. Ioh. 4. 20. 21.

Q. Rehearse the words of the preface.

A. God spoke all these words, saying, etc.

Q. What is contained in these words?

A. The precept it self, and three several reasons set before it.

shows that he has absolute power and just right to command all, and

promise, to give us all good things here, and in the world to come eternal
life; and therefore we are bound to obey him. Heb. 11. 16. Ps. 144. 15.

Q. What is the third reason?

A. It is contained in these words, Which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, etc. In which God puts the Jews in mind what a great deliverance he had
given them, and therefore bound them to obey him.

devil, and therefore we are straightly bound to obey this law.
