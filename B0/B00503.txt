The Lovers Joy and Grief:
OR
A young man's relation
In a pitiful fashion,
Being from his Love hindered
By Locks, Bolts, and Kindred.
To the tune of Yongmen and Maids.


AMong the uine, all Nymphs divine,
that haunt the forked mountain,
If any will bring me a Quil,
dipped in Castalia's fountain
I Will show (in brief) my joy and grief,
and her due praises render,
To whom I would come if I could,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
My joy, in that I had the fate,
to choose so rare a jewel,
My grief in this, that she (my bliss)
is kept by kindred cruel,
Out of my sight, which day and night
does pierce my heart so tender,
It Is she to whom I feign would come,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
She is a Less that does surpass,
her neighbors round about her,
Her worth is such, it grieves me much,
to live so long without her:
With strong desire in Cupids ^ire,
my heart burns to a cinder,
I would possess my happiness
but locks and bolts do hinder.
As Thisbe fair by Parents care
from Pyramus was hidden,
So she to come abroad from home
is earnestly forbidden:
She dares not stir, nor I to her,
so closely they have penned her,
She would come out I make noe doubt,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
As Danae was in the Tower of brass,
enclosed by her Father,
So she (my sweet) lest we should meet,
is kept more closely rather:
Yet as great love got to his Love,
though walls did comprehend her,
So I do hope to have free scope,
though locks and bolts do hinder.
In The interim I must patiently
expect that happy season,
I dare not think that she will shrink,
for intruth I have no reason,
I find that she is true to me,
in that I must commend her,
She would not be so long from me.
but locks and bolts do hinder.
It grieves my heart to think what smart
(poor creature) she endures,
What means her kindred use to win
her heart, which she assures
Is fixed fast, while life does last,
no policy can bend her,
To any course love has such forcs,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
The second part
To the same tune.


She has (it is true to speak what is due)
too great a marriage portion,
This may I vow, for Cupid now,
is bent unto extortion?
I would therefore her friends were poor,
or else in heart more tender,
For poor or rich we would go through stitch,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
Although my self want worldly pelf,
unto their expectation,
Yet if I may the truth display,
without any ostentation,
My birth and parts and due deserts
are not so weak and slender,
But that I might earne my delight,
though locks and bolts do hinder.
Were I a Prince of eminence,
and she a peasants daughter,
Had she no more of learnings store,
then what wise nature taught her,
Her peerless face and inward grace,
shows in my heart such splendour,
She mine should be, the like says she,
but locks and bolts do hinder.
It Is not her pelf but her sweet self,
that I (in heart) do couit
Necessity let wealth supply,
for nothing else I love it,
Her only love is that does move
my heart and makes it tender,
I mourn in grief without relief,
for locks and bolts do hinder.
No ease of mind at all I find,
but only this assurance,
That my dear wench will never flinch,
though she be kept in durance,
She has her share of woe and care
for which I must commend her,
On me she has bestowed her faith,
though locks and bolts do hinder.
Continue still in thy good will.
thou Paragon of beauty,
And I to thee as true will be
(so am I bound in duty)
Though fortune frown, yet the renown
of our affections tender,
Abroad is flowne, we two are one,
though locks and bolts do hinder.
With patience we will expect to feel,
the fruit of all this sorrow,
Though sorrow may endure this day,
I shall have joy to morrow,
In the mean while, I in exile
will be thy true defender,
And spread thy name which is my claim.
though locks and bolts do hinder.
Oh cruel fate, expire the date,
of two dear Lovers trouble,
If once our grief do find relief,
our joys will then be double
And all our tears, our cares and fears,
will to our names add splender
Thy heart is mine, and mine is thine,
though locks and bolts do hinder.
M.P.
