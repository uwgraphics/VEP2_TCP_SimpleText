Stand to it WHETSTON-PARK Ladies: or; The Country Lasses farewell to Sorrow.
Maids, here is Caution how to gain rich Talents,
Do, as I Have done, keep Company with Gallants;
By which I Am raised from mean to high degree,
In being to young Heirs and Gallants free:
I fear no Colors but will stand it out,
The worst can be, is the Covent-Garden-Gout.
To the Tune of, Never a Penny of Money.


I Am a brave Lase, and I Traveled about,
with a fa la la la le le la le to,
And behaved my self bravely upon the Road,
with a fa la la la le le la le to;
And was welcome to every place where I did come,
And many a brave Gallant did look me upon,
But I have fine trick for to play with my own:
with a fa la la le la le to.
I prosper'd so well that to London I came,
with a fa la, etc.
For that is a place to get a good name,

And many brave Gallants do me find:
I Will promise unto them I Will not be unkind:
with a fa la, etc.
Now a crown or an Angel I have in the nick,
with a fa la, etc.
For they find that I bravely can do the trick,
with a fa la, etc.

And many a brave Gallant does call me their Dear,
They see I am so willing to let out my Ware.

When I was in the Country I thought of a thing,
with a fa la, etc.
That it was a great shame to sit there for to Spin:

And Whigg, whey, and Butter milk was but course diet,
For in my mind I could never be quite,
Now I am in London I live for more riot:

I am a found Country Girl, and give no one a Clap,
with a fa la, etc.
Five Crowns at a time I have in my han^.
And all for fine kisses they have at command,
This is gallant profit I do understand,

Though I was but simply born in degree,
with a fa la, etc.
My Father old ^est in getting of me.

That any that comes will hardly pass by,

But come up to London and learn to be rich,
What if now and then she do venture a touch,
with a fa la, etc.
Nothing venture, nothing have,
with a fa la, etc.
I am all for brave Gamsters, I scorn a poor knave,

Who live in the Country as I did before,
with a fa la, etc.
For a Groat a day that is very poor,

When Crowns and Angels are nothing to me,
To pleasure young Gallants that be free,
If I make use of my own, what is that to thee,

So I can hold up my trade, and live free from all sorrow,
with a fa la, etc.
If I have no money o're-night, I Will have some to morrow
with a fa la, etc.
And call for a Coach, and jog it about,
With ranting brave Gallants come in and go out,
If I escape but the Covent Garden Gout.
