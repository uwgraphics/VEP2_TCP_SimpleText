The Wooing Less, and the Way-ward Lad,
Who long had made his Sweetheart sad,
Because to her he would not yield,
Till Cupid him to Love compeld.
To the tune of The Nightingale.




Upon a Holy day,
When the Nimphs had leave to play,
I sat unseene
In a Meddow green,
where I heard a Less in an angry spleen,
Persuading of a Swain
To leave his drudging vain,
and sport with her upon the Plain.
But the silly Clown,
Did sadly sit him down:
And regardlesse of her moan,
He left her all alone.
then she cried,
Come away bony Boy,
Come away;
I cannot come,
I will not come,
I dare not come,
M^ works not done,
and this was all the Clown would say.
Quoth she thou gentle Swain,
Do not my love disdain,
Thou should woe me,
How I woe thee,
let not thy heart so froward be,
But yield to my request,
In ^roth I do not jest,
it is thee alone that I love best.
Yet the simple Ass,
Respected not the Less,
Hard hearted that he was
With her he would not pass,
though she cried
Come away bony Boy, etc.
I prithee Sweet (she said)
Regard a Love-sicke Maid,
It Is thee alone
Must ease my moan,
or else I comfort can get none*
O be not so obdure,
O sit not so demure,
let me thy love (with prayers) procure.
But all in vain
She wood the surly Swain,
For she could not obtain,
His love that she would feign,
though she cried
Come away bony Boy, etc.
Yet still the loving Girl
Besought the clownish Churl,
And wood him still,
For his good will,
but her success was always ill,
For all that painful while,
She could not see him smile,
her troubled thoughts to reconcile.
The homebred Lad,
For skill in loving had,
He gave her answers bad,
Which made her very sad:
yet she cried
Come away bony Boy,
Come away;
I cannot come,
I will not come,
I dare not come,
My worke's not done,
And this was all the Clown would say*
The second part,
To the same tune.






YEt she would not be answered so,
Nor from him would she go,
So soon away,
But she still made stay,
to hear more what the Swain would say.
O courteous Lad she said,
Reflect upon a Maid,
and let me thee to love persuade:
But all this wind
No comfort yet could find
Herein him to her mind,
For still he was unkind,
though she cried,
Come away bony Boy,
Come away;
I cannot come,
I will not come,
I dare not come,
My worke's not done,
and this was all the Clown would say.
Just as the Paphean Queen,
Adonis urged to spleen,
As he was coy,
even so this Boy
could not be won to kiss and toy.
Though humbly there besought,
It no compassion wrought,
for he to love would not be taught.
On him she hung,
From her away he flung,
He bade her hold her tongue,
For he would not go along,
yet she cried,
Come away bony Boy, etc.
As Salmacis (so bright)
Did woo young Aphrodite,
But all in vain,
So she this Swain,
and could not her request obtain,
For he was obstinate,
And bade her leave her prate,
thus for her love she purchaste hate.
Love was so strong,
In this bonny Less so young,
That she could not hold her tongue,
Though he had denied so long:
yet she cried,
Come away bonny Boy, etc.
This Maid was grieved sore,
Great cause she had therefore,
Since 'twas her fate,
To love for hate,
which she could not anticipate.
Such force young Cupid has,
Over them that tread his path,
the Lad regards not what she says.
He does persist,
Still to resist,
To her he will not list,
But bids her to be whist,
though she cried,
Come away bonny Boy, etc.
The Maid was grieved in mind,
That the Lad was so unkind:
Then to Venus she went,
Sore discontent,
who charged her Boy with his Bow ready bent,
To take a nimble Dart,
And pierce him to the heart,
because he did her precept thwart.
Cupid strong,
Gave the Lad such a bang,
That he forced him to gang,
With his bonny Less along,
when she cried,
Come away bonny Boy,
Come thou hither;
I come, I come,
I run, I run,
Now I am won,
All shall be done,
And so they went along together.
By this we well may prove,
The wondrous power of Love.
For this young Boy,
Before so coy,
now calls the Maid his only Joy.
He took her by the waste,
And kindly her embraced,
he pays her love with kisses chaste.
He grieves in mind,
That before was unkind,
He tells her she shall find,
That the best shall come behind,
and indeed,
They with speed were agreed
Each with other:
With joint consent,
And hearts content,
To Church they went,
Incontinent,
and there they married were together.
