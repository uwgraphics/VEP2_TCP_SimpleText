A pleasant new ballad, showing how Sir John Armstrong and Nathaniel Musgrave
fell in Love with the Lady Dacres Daughter of the North; and of the strife that
was between them for her, and how they wrought the Death of one hundred men.
To a new Northern Tune.


AS it fell out one Whitsunday,
the blithe time of the year,
When chery tree was clad with green,
and pretty Birds sing clear;
The Lady Dacres took her way,
Unto the Church that pleasant day,
With her fair daughter fresh and gay,
a bright and bonny Less:
Fa la tree dang de do;
trang trole lo trang de do,
With hey trang trole lo lie,
she was a bonny Lass.
Sir Michael Musgrave in like sort,
to Church repaired then,
And so did sir John Armstrong too,
with all his merry men,
Two greater friends there could not be
Nor braver Knights for Chivalry,
Both Batchelors of high degree,
fit for a bonny Less.
They sat them down upon one seat,
like loving brethren dear,
With hearts and minds devoutly bent
Gods service for to hear:
But rising from their Prayers tho,
Their eyes a ranging straight did go,
Which wrought their utter overthrow
all for one bonny Less.
Quoth. Musgrave unto Armstrong then,
yon sits the sweetest Dame,
That ever for her fair beauty,
within this Country came.
Insooth quoth Armstrong presently,
Your judgment I must verefie,
There never came unto my eye
a braver bonny Less.
I swear said Musgrave by this sword,
which did my Knighthood win,
To steal away so sweet a Dame,
could be no ghostly sin:
That deed quoth. Armstrong would be ill,
Except he had her right good will,
That your desire she would fulfill,
and be thy bonny Less.
By this the service quite was done,
and home the people past,
They wished a blister on his tongue,
that made thereof such have.
At the Church door ye knights did meet,
The Lady Dacres for to greet.
But most of all her daughter sweet,
that beauteous bonny Less.
Said Armstrong to the Lady fair:
we both have made a vow,
At dinner for to be your Guests,
if you will it allow.
With that bespake that Lady free,
Sir Knights right welcome shall you be
The happier men therefore are we,
for Love of this bonny Less.
Thus was ye knights both pricked in love
both in one moment thrall'd,
And both with one fair Lady gay
thus blind in Cupid called.
With humble thanks they went away
Like wounded Hearts chaste all the day:
One would not to the other say,
they loved this bonny Less.
Fair Isabel on the other side,
as far in love was found,
So long brave Armstrong she had eyed,
till love her heart did wound;
Brave Armstrong is my joy, quoth she
Would Chrift he were alone with me;
To talk an hour two or three,
with his fair bonny Less.


But as these knights together rode
and homeward did repair,
Their talk and eke their countenance showed
their hearts were clogged with care,
Fair Isabel the one did say,
Thou have subdued my heart this day;
But she is my joy did Musgrove say,
my bright and bonny Less.
With that these friends incontinent,
became most deadly foes,
For love of beauteous Isabel,
great strife betwixt them rose;
Quoth Armstrong she shall be my wife,
Although for her I lose my life,
And thus began a deadly strife,
and for one bonny Less.
Thus two years long this grudge did grow
these gallant Knights between,
While they a wooing both did go,
unto this beauteous Queen.
And she who did their furies prove,
To neither would bewray her love,
The deadly quarrel to remove,
about this bonny Less.
But neither of her fair entreats,
nor yet her sharp dispute:
Would they appease their raging ire,
nor yet give ore their suit.
The Gentlemen of the North country
At last did make this good decree,
All for a perfert unity,
about this bonny Less.
The love sick knights should both be set
within one hall so wide,
Each of them in a gallant sort,
even at a several tide.
And twixt them both for certainty,
Fair Isabel should placed be,
Of them to take her choice full free,
most like a bonny Less.
And as she like an Angel bright,
betwixt them mildly stood,
She turned unto each several Knight,
with pale and changed blood.
Now am I at Liberty,
To make and take my choice, quoth she
Yea, quoth the Knights we do agree,
then choose thou bonny Less.
O Musgrave thou art all too hot:
to be a Ladies Love,
Quoth she and Armstrong seems a sot,
where Love binds him to prove;
Of courage great is Musgrave still,
And since to choose I have my Will,
Sweet Armstrong shall my joys fulfill
and I his bonny Less.
The Nobles and the Gentiles both,
that were in present place,
Rejoiced at this sweet record,
but Musgrave in disgrace,
Out of the Hall did take his way,
And Armstrong married was next day
With Isabel his Lady gay,
a bright and bonny Less.
But Musgrave on the wedding day,
like to a Scotch-man dight,
In secret sort allured out,
the Bridegroom for to fight,
And he that will not out-brav'd be,
Unto his challenge did agree,
Where he was slain most suddenly,
for his fair bonny Less.
The news hereof was quickly brought,
unto the Lovely Bride;
And many of young Armstrongs kin,
did after Musgrave ride.
They hewed him when they had him got
As small as flesh into the pot,
Lo thus befell a heavy Lot,
about this bonny Less.
The Lady young which did lament
this cruel cursed strife,
For very grief died that day,
a Maiden and a Wife:
An hundred men that hapless day,
Did loose their Lives in that same fray
And 'twixt those names as many say,
is deadly hate still biding.
FINIS.
