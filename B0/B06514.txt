UPON Our Royal Queens Majesty's MOST HAPPY ARRIVAL, THE MOST Illustrious
Donna Catherina Sole-Sister to the High and Mighty KING of PORTUGAL.
THe Princely Muses do my Fancy move,
To consecrate a Verse to that blessed Love,
That Royal Qneen of Grace, and great command
Espoused to Charles Le Bon, and Charles Le Grand.
Prophetickly by him so well designed,
Who was with Heavenly knowledge fo resin'd?
Heaven guard them Both together, and reflect
That influence of Favor, to protect
That Sacred Nymph, whose passage did so please
The Eternal God of Heaven, of Earth, of Seas,
To welcome Her with Complemental Ditties,
Echoes of Joy rebound in Court and Cities:
And lest the lowest place true love should want,
Or we be deemed of Devotion scant;
Lo I presume alone from Country Caves
To come and honor those Neptunian waves
Have brought us home with such propitious gales,
A Princely Mother to a Prince of Wales;
Who may (my Genius thinks) in time outvie,
The richest Gems of Glorious Chivalry:
And equalize in worth, if not exceed
The bravest Hero's of our British breed:
And with Pegasean Frigates lowdly roar
At the proud banks of that Iberian shore:
And with triumphant Valor once again
Set up his Standard in the Realms of Spain:
And with a Crown of Fortune there resume
A Trophee, like the brave Bohemian plume,
And by victorious Virtue still advance
That Princely House of Portugal, Braganze
To Englands high renown, and in despite
Of all such Foes as dare against them fight,
May our Imperial Lion rampant stand,
With the blessed Unicorn at his command,
Who by his secret Virtues may confound
All Poisons in the Springs of English ground:
That being Crowned at home with perfect Peace,
His glories through the world may still increase:
Great Princes shall adore his Royal word,
And Nations tremble at his conquering sword,
Then Foreign parts will fear our force, and then
Our Sovereign shall be styled, The King of Men;
And may his Dearest Consort blessed be,
With all rare fortunes of felicity:
The grace of Heaven, the prime deiights of Earth,
Make Her the Mirror of Content and Mirth,
Celestial Angels guard her free from harms,
Sweetly embraced in our Sovereigns arms;
Heaven guide her grace, and make her truly seen,
Of Beauty, Wit and Majesty the Queen
A fit Consort to please the good desires
Of such a Prince whom all the World admires
And may this Princely payer rest in love,
More firm and constant than the Turtle Dove;
Gods grace their Lives both prosper and protect,
And in the end Their souls to Heaven direct;
And grant them here that Quintessence of glory,
Was never read in my CESARS story;
That after-ages may of them rehearse,
A glorious Wonder to the Universe.
