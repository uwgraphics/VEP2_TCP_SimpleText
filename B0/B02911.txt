MEMENTO MORI depiction of skeletons, crossbones, and other emblems of Death in
border surrounding elegy
ON THE DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM SHARP OF STONNIE-HILL.
TWo Potent Heralds jointly do proclaim
Good Stonnie-hill's deserved Praise, and Fame:
Dame Nature framed Him, Faithful, Wise, and Just,
Fortune afforded Trial of His Trust.
Our Sov'raign's Cash, and Signet testify
Sir William Signal, for Fidelity.
O Stonie-hill! (but certainly the best
Of Parian-Marble, for a Solid Breast;)
Noble, Ignoble Person, Rich, or Poor,
Were at His hand of equal dealing sure.
Religion, Prudence, Truth, and Loyalty,
Perpetuat His Fragrant Memory.
His nearest Heir, and kindly Legators,
Are of just Purchase, justly Possessors:
Heaven has His Soul, the Grave His Corpse; but must
Refound the meanest Atome of His Dust.
R. D.
