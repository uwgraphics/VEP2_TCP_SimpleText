forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors: And ^ead us not into
temptation, but deliver us from evil: for thine is the Kingdom and the power,
and the glory for ever, Amen.

The CREED.
I Believe in God the Father Almighty maker of Heaven and Earth: and in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of
the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified Dead and Buried,
he descended into That is, continued in the state of the Dead, and under the
power of Death till the third day.
Hell, the third day he arose again from the dead, he ascended into Heaven, and
sits on the right ^and of God the Father Almighty, from thence he shall come
to judge the quick and the dead: I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Holy
Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the
Resurrection of the Body, and the life everlasting, Amen.

SO much of every question is repeated in the Answe^ as makes every Answer an
entire Proposition (...) Sentence in it self, to the end the Learner may
furth^^ improve it upon all occasions, for his increase in Knowledge and Piety,
even out of the Course of Catechizing, (...) well as in it.

And albeit the substance of the Doctrine comprised that abridgment, commonly
called, The Apostles Creed, fully set forth in each of the Catechisms, so as
there is (...) necessity of inserting the Creed it self, yet it is here
anne^ed; not as though it were composed by the Apostles, (...) ought to be
esteemed Canonical Scripture, as the Ten Commandments and the Lords Prayer,
much less a Prayer (a^ ignorant people have been apt to make both it and the
D^calogue) but because it is a brief sum of the Christian Faith agreeable to
the Word of God, and anciently rec^^ved in the Church of Christ.
