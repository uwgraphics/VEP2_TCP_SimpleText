THere will be delivered out 800 Tickets, which will be Numbered from One to
8th Hundred, and there will be Three Tickets of one and the same Number, that
is to say, there will be Three of the Number one, and three of number two, and
so to one to 800: The first of which Number is given to the person that puts in
his five shillings, The second of the same number, is put into a box to be
drawn for the person, and the Third of the same Number remains in the Book, to
compare the other two with, after the Adventure is drawn. As suppose in the
Drawing this Adventure, Number 50 should come up with the 30 (...), the Per^
that has that Number. going to the Person from whom he took out his Ticket,
and compairing it with the Number that remains in the Book, will receive it, As
you may perceive by the following cut, which is the Form of the Tickets
delivered out. Numb: 50 Numb: 50 Numb 50

I promise to par to the Bearer 5 shillings St^rlings, if this Adventure is not
Drawn, or a Drowing, on the first day of July, 1700: or ten days after, and
when drawn, to pay the Benefited Lot.

At the time prefixed for the Drawing this Adventure, The second Ticket
remaining in (...) Book, will be cut off, roulled up, and Sewed in the middle,
and so put into a Bagg and shaked till they are will mixed, and then thrown out
of the Bagg into the Box, from whence they are to be dra^^.

Then the prizes, That is to say, The benefit Lot, of 30 pounds and all the
rest, will be rouled up and Sewed in the middle, and so mixed with as many
blanks as will make up the Number of 800 Tickets, which is Answerable to the
number of Tickets delivered out.

The Prizes and Blaoks being first fairly mixed together, will be put into a
Box by themselves, and thence to be drawn by two Boys, as follow.

One Boy taken out a Number out of the Box of Numbers, and the other Boy takes
out One of the Rouled Papers our of the other Box from among the Blanks and
Prizes; And then both the Papers are opened, and given into the Hands of the
Proclaimer who Proclaims what Number ^s Drawn, and whether it be a Blank or a
Prize.

As suppose the Boy that draws out of the Box of Numbers, should draw Number
50, and the Paper the other Boy draws from among the Blanks and prizes, be the
prize of 30 pounds Starling, then be that has the Number 50, is entitled to
it. But if a Blank be drawn with the Number 50. That Number is a blank.

The time for Drawing this Adventure, is designed to be the 1 day of July,
1700. At the E^^^ India Coffee House, but it will be drawn sooner if full, and
it is not doubted but it may sooner full, A great many persons having already
taken out their Tickets.

Cookburn Gold smith, and George Drummond Good Man of the Tolbooth, and Gavin
Plummer Merchant in Edinburgh. T^ckets are to be delivered out by Robert Bruce
