A soluntary SONG, for all stubborn Sinners to amend their Lives and evil Ways.
For uncertain in man's life one day
For many you see are snatched away
We stand in need then every minute and hour.
To pray for Gods Grace to give us power
To repent our lives and mend our ways
We are in great danger in these days.
If Death do come and we be unprepared,
There will be then a bad reward;
Therefore we had need to watch and pray
That our Sins they may be all washed away;
There Is but one way that we can have,
There Is no Repentance in the Grave.
To the Tune of The Sinners Redemption.




GOod People mind what here is penned
and understand what I do say
Repentance by no means prolong
'twill be your own another day,
Happy's that sinner to be sure,
That true Repentance can procure,
For when that I am dead and gone
you find these words for to be true,
Forsake your Sins then every one,
before you bid the world adieu,
Happy's that Sinner,
If you are not prepared for Death,
when he does give the fatal stroke
And comes to stop your mortal Breath,
your Souls undone and Hearts are broke,
Happy's that Sinner,
The Riches of this world have wings
and often you see do fly away
Then mind you that which comfort brings
that never fades nor will decay
Happy's that Sinner,
Do Righteous things to every one
as thou would have them to do to thee
By this a good man be known
by his good works and piety,
Happy's that Sinner.
Cherish the poor that are in need
the Rich do seldom want a friend
But he that gives the poor indeed,
does to the God Almighty lend,
Happy's that Sinner to be sure,
That true Repentance can procure.
The second part
to the same Tune.
The naked man see that you cloth,
the hungry Person see you feed,
These things observe false dealing loath
and thou shall happy be indeed,
Happy's that Sinner.
Frequent the Church where Godly men,
Gods word do preach and cry down sin,
Keep Gods Commandments and then
a blessed condition thou art in,
Happy's that Sinner.
The Widow be thou kind unto
and help the Orphant that is oppressed,
For he that all these things will do
there is no doubt but he is blessed,
Happy's that Sinner.
And he that has mercy loves to show,
shall mercy find himself at last,
But Cruelty will overthrow
and all the other virtues blast,
Happy's that Sinner.
Flee that which loathsome is to man,
and hateful in Gods blessed sight
It Is drunkenness that here I mean,
wherein so many take delight,
Happy's that Sinner.
Take Pleasure in Gods Holy Word,
and therein set your hearts delight,
Such Pleasure 'twill your Hearts afford
that you will find advantage by it,
Happy's that Sinner.
Pride was you know the Devils Fall,
as Holy Scriptures plain do tell;
'Twill also bring man's Soul to thrall
and is a plain pathway to Hell
Happy's that Sinner,
And often the holy Bible read
therein you may great Comfort find,
For wounded Souls there is help indeed
and Comfort for the troubled mind,
Happy's that Sinner.
Mind not the Peoples vain applause
but let your actions speak your praise
Keep Gods Commands and obey his Laws,
and thou shall happy be always,
Happy's that Sinner.
Repent thee of thy wickedness
and do it most unfeignedly,
So in thy life God will thee bless
and save thy Soul when thou shall dye,
Happy's that Sinner.
Do not delay Repentance for
it is without doubt a great offense,
And that which Consience will abhor,
when thy poor Soul is gone from hence
Happy's that Sinner.
Then mortal man since Death is sure
put thou thy confidence in him
Who only can thy help procure
in time of need when Death looks grim
Happy's that Sinner.
Now the God of Heaven be our guide,
that we all may make a happy end,
That we all our Sins may lay aside
to pray our Savior Christ be our friend,
Happy's that Sinner to be sure
That true Repentance can procure.
