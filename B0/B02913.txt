A delicate new Ditty, composed upon the Posie of a Ring, being; I fancy none
but the alone: sent as a New-yeares gift, by a Lover to his Sweetheart.
To the tune of, Dulcina.




THou that art so sweet a creature,
that above all earthly joy,
I thee deem for thy rare feature,
kill me not by seeming coy;
nor be thou mute,
when this my suit
Into thy cares by love is blowing,
but say by me,
as I by thee,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Had thou Cupids mothers beauty,
and Diana's chaste desires,
Think on that which is thy duty,
to fulfill what love requires:
it is Love I ask,
and it is thy task,
To be propitious to my moan,
for still I say,
and will for aye,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Let not self-conceit ore-strain thee,
woman was at first ordained
To serve man, though I obey thee,
being by Loves Law constrained;
my sobs and tears,
true witness bears.
Of my hearts grief and heavy moan,
let not thy frown
then me cast down,
Who fancies none but thee alone,
Think what promise thou did give me,
when I first did thee behold,
There thou vowd'st thou would not leave me,
for a mass of Indian gold,
but now I find

him entertain.
Who fancies none but thee alone,
Let my true affections move thee
to commiserate my pain,
If thou knew'st how dear I love thee,
sure thou would love me again:
I thee affect
and more respect
Thy welfare then I do mine own,
let this move thee,
to pity me,
Who fancies none but thee alone.
Why should Women be obdurate,
and men's proffers thus despise?
Dear be ruled, we have a Curate,
nuptial Rites to solemnize:
thou Marigold,
whose leaves unfold,
When Tytans rays reflect thereon,
on thee I Will shine,
for thou art mine,
I fancy none but thee alone.

Dear I have received thy token,
and with it thy faithful love,
Prithee let no more be spoken,
I to thee will constant prove,
do not despair,
nor live in care,
For her who vows to be thy own,
though I seem strange,
I will not change,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Think not that I will fore-goe thee,
though I Am absent from thy sight,
When I find my self kept from thee,
I Would be with thee day and night,
but well thou know,
how I am crossed,
Else should my Love to thee be shown,
with free accord,
yet take my word,
I fancy none but thee alone.
This Proverb has often bin used,
she that is bound must needs obey,
And thou see how I Am enclosed,
from thy presence night and day,
I dare not show
what love I owe
To thee, for fear it should be knowde,
yet still my mind,
shall be inclined
To fancy none but thee alone.
