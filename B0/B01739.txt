Kind WILLIAM, Or, Constant BETTY.
Let Maids beware, and shun the snare,
I say be ruled by me;
Though you embrace, be perfect Chaste,
from stains of Infamy.
To the Tune of The Doubting Virgin.


COnstant Betty that sweet Creature,
she was William's hearts delight;
In the Shades he chanced to meet her,
when Fair Phoebus shined bright:
In conclusion his delusion
was to bring her to his Bow,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she answered, no, no, no.
Then his Betty he Embraced,
hoping for to win the Field,
She with modesty was graced,
and resolved not to yield:
She denied, he replied,
do not seek my Overthrow,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she answered no, no, no.
Thou have set mine heart on fire,
sweetest Creature be not coy,
Grant me what I do desire,
thou shall be my only joy:
Thus he Wooed her to delude her,
and to bring her to his Bow,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she answered no, no, no.
Love thou art my only treasure,
then he took her by the hand,
Let me now enjoy the pleasure,
I will be at thy command:
Don't abuse me, nor refuse me,
lest it proves my overthrow,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she, etc.
Now admit me, my sweet Betty,
to salute and lay thee down,
None alive I think more prity,
I will thee with pleasure Crown:
Don't deny me, do but try me,
from those charms such pleasures flow,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she, etc.
Thy obliging Eye has won me,
dearest I am not in jest,
Why should thou be coy and shun me,
I am certainly possessed
With thy Beauty for my duty
is to bring thee to my Bow.
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she, etc.
Dearest Betty sit down by me,
let us lovingly agree,
Sweetest Creature don't deny me,
Cupid's Dart has wounded me:
Then come near me, Love and cheer me
for my heart is sinking low,
Let Us not dally, shall I, shall I,
but she, etc.
Betty's Answer to William's Request. WIlliam you are much mistaken,
you shall never me ensnare,
In your Net I Will not be taken,
therefore now your Suit forbear:
I Will deny it, and defy it,
for I vow it shall not be so,
While I marry, I will tarry,
and will answer no, no, no.
I from Love will be excluded,
ever I Will hear an idle Tale,
I will never be deluded,
no, nor shall you ever prevail,
To embrace me, and disgrace me,
thus to sink my heart full low,
While I marry, I will tarry,
and will, etc.

WILLIAM. Now my loving constant Betty,
I will ever thee adore,
For thy Answer has been witty,
I will never tempt thee more:
When I tried thee, thou denied me,
all thy answer still was No,
We'll not tarry, but will Marry,
then it must and shall be so.

FINIS.
