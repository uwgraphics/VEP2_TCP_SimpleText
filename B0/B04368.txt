The Mistaken LOVER; OR, The supposed Ungrateful Creature, appears a True
Pattern of LOYALTY.
Alas I in vain he did Complain,
and counted her his Foe;
Concluding she would Cruel be,
but it was nothing so.
To an Excellent New Tune, Sung at Court.
This may be Printed, R. P.





OH so Ungrateful a Creature,
never could I thought you to be,
(...) to abuse my good Nature,
laugh at my Simplicity:
You above all, had least reason,
first to abuse my poor heart,
But if another had done it,
you ought to have taken my part,
Curse of your cunning proceeding,
curse of your private Amor,
While my poor heart lies a bleeding,
may you be double cursed over:
Was you but kind as you're cruel,
then you may talk of a bliss,
But you preserve me for Fuel,
O what a Tyrant is this!




You that my Torment invented,
proving the cause of my grief,
May you in Dreams be tormented,
never obtaining Relief:
Languishing like one forsaken,
drowned in sorrowful tears,
Evermore when you awaken,
haunted with troops of new fears.
Though in disdain you forsake me,
seeing my joys are increased,
It Is not your Frowns that shall make me
ever repine in the least
It Is not a true Lovers duty,
such a hard heart to adore,
I Will never dote on your Beauty,
since there is many in store.
When he had made this Oration,
then the young Damsel drew near,
Not in a furious Passion,
but like a Lover most dear:
Why do thou count me Disloyal,
this makes my very heart ache,
Might it be put to the trial,
Love, I would dye for thy sake.
How could you Curse me, that never
proved once false to my Love,
Making my constant endeavor,
every thing to remove,
Which might thy Happiness hinder;
this is the truth of my heart,
If I have been an Offender,
then let me suffer the smart.
Love, I cannot be so Fickle,
she in soft Language replys,
While many tears they did trickle,
down from her beautiful eyes:
I that have never offended,
you judge me guilty to stand,
O that my sorrows were ended,
by the most fatalest hand.
Hearing her sorrowful Ditty,
and that her Love it was pure,
Then he was moved with pity,
and could no longer endure.
Then in the purest perfection,
sorrows was turned to Bliss,
Sealing her perfect protection,
with many a tender sweet kiss.
FINIS.
