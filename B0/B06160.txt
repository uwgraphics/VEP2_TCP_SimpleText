Tom Farthing: OR, The Married VVomans Complaint.
To a New Tune, well known by the same Name.




Tom Farthing, Tom Farthing,
Where have thou bin? Tom Farthing?
Twelve a clock e're thou come in,
Four or five e're thou begin,
Lie all night and do nothing,
'Twould make a woman weary, weary,
'Twould make a women weary.
Had thou bin a lively Lad,
And gi'n me part of what thoud'st had,
It would have made my heart full glad:
And made me wondrous merry, merry,
And made, etc.
But thou art a Country clown,
Sometimes up and sometimes down;
Still doing what was never yet done,
'Twould make a woman, sorry, sorry,
'Twould, etc.
Tom Farthing, Tom Farthing,
Thou bungler art, Tom Farthing,
Was ever Woman fumbled so,
With always bobbing too and fro,
Now too high, and now too low,
'Twould make a woman weary, weary,
'Twould etc.
If thou had but held me to it,
With hip and lip, and leg and foot,
Besides the other thing to boot,
'Twould have made me wondrous merry, merry,
'Twould, etc.
But rivel'd up like Chitterlin,
You Are sometimes out and, sometimes in
And all thou dost's not worth a pin,
Which makes me wondrous sorry, sorry,
Which makes me wondrous sorry.
The second Part,
to the same Tune.




TOm Farthing, Tom Farthing,
Thou make me mad, Tom Farthing,
'Twas not for this I did thee wed,
Nor brought thee to my marriage bed,
But 'twas to lose my Maidenhead,
Of which i am wondrous weary, weary,
Of which I am wondrous weary.
Could thou once but do the feat,
And show thy self to be no cheat,
My very heart with joy would beat,
And 'twould make me wondrous merry, merry,
And etc.
But by thy side thou idle droan,
I lie like one that lies alone,
And remedy I can get none,
Which makes me wondrous sorry sorry,
Which makes me wondrous sorry.
Tom Farthing, Tom Farthing,
Farewell, farewell, Tom Farthing,
Since by thee it cannot be done,
I Will now go pick of another bone,
For meat from thee I can get none,
Which makes me wondrous weary, weary
Which etc.
And though a Woman's such, you cry,
That no one can her wants supply,
I Will find out one shall satisfy;
And make me wondrous merry, merry,
And etc.
For since thou never yet have don't
I Will bid no more, a pox upon it,
But venture let what will come on it,
And never more be sorry sorry,
And etc.
Tom Farthing, Tom Farthing,
A warning be Tom Farthing,
Hence forward that no woman take,
A Fumbler for Tom Farthings sake:
Unless she will him Cuckold make,
For he will make her damnable wearry, weary
For he will make, etc.
But if a Husband must be had,
Try him first or else you are mad,
Then should he prove a capering Lad,
He Will make you wondrous merry, merry,
And of him you will never be weary.
FINIS.
