THE CL. PSALMS OF DAVID.
PSALM I.
^THe man is blessed that has not bent, to wicked read his ear: Nor led his
life as sinners do, nor sat in scorners chair.


does set his whole delight:
And in that Law does exercise,
himself both day and night.

fast by the river side:
Which brings forth most pleasant fruit
in her due time and tide.
Whose leaf shall never fade nor fall,
but flourish still and stand:
Even so shall all things prosper well,
that this man takes in hand.

they shall be nothing so:
But as the dust, which from the earth,
the wind drives to and fro.

in judgment stand upright:
Nor yet the sinners with the just,
shall come in place or sight.

unto the Lord is known:
And eke the way of wicked men,
shall quite be ouer-throwne.
PSALM II.
WHy did the Gentiles tumultes raise, what rage was in their brain? Why did
the Jewish people muse, seeing all is but vain?

The Kings and Rulers of the earth,
conspire and are all bent,
against the Lord and Christ his Son,
whom he among us sent.

let all their bonds be broke:
And of their doctrine and their law,
let us reject the yoke.

their doings will deride:
And make them all as mocking stocks,
through-out the world so wide.

to them upon a day:
And in his fury trouble them,
and then the Lord will say:

upon my holy hill:
I will therefore, Lord, preach thy laws
and eke declare thy will.

did say to me, I wot:
Thou art my dear and only Son,
this day I thee begote.

as heirs at thy request:
The ends and coasts of all the earth,
by thee shall be possessed.

as men under foot trod:
And as the potters shearde shall break,
them with an iron rod.

be wise, therefore, and learnde:
By whom the matters of the world,
be judged and discernde.

in trembling and in fear:
See that with reverence ye rejoice,
to him in like manner.

his blessed Son, I say:
Lest in his wrath ye suddenly,
perish in the mid way.
If once his wrath never so small,
shall kindle in his breast:

shall happy be and blessed.
PSALM III.
O Lord, how are my foes increast, which vex me more and more! They kill
mine heart, when as they say, God can him not restore.


when I am hard bestead.
My worship and mine honor both,
and thou holdst up mine head.

I did both call and cry:
And he out of his holy hill,
did hear me by and by.

I slept, and rose again:
For why? I know assuredly,
the Lord will me sustain.

I could not be afraid:
For thou art still my Lord, my God,
my Savior, and mine aid.

for now to thee I call:
For thou have broke the cheeks and teeth,
of these wicked men all.

to thee, O Lord, above:
Thou do bestow upon thy folk,
thy blessing and thy love.
PSALM IV.
Sing this as the 3. Psalm.
O God that art my righteousness, Lord hear me when I call: Thou have set
me at liberty, when I was bound and thrall.


and grant me this request:
For unto thee incessantly,
to cry I will not rest.

my glory thus despise?
Why wander ye in vanity,
and follow after lies?

the Lord does take and choose:
And when to him I make my plaint,
he does me not refuse.

examine well your heart:
And in your chamber quietly,
see ye your selves convert.

of righteousness, I say:
And look that in the living Lord,
you put your trust always.

and riches do embrace:
But, Lord, grant us thy countenance,
thy favor and thy grace:

more joyful and more glad,
Then they that of their corn and wine,
full great increase have had.

taking my rest and sleep:
For thou only wilt me, O Lord,
alone in safety keep.
PSALM V.
Sing this as the 3. Psalm.
INcline thine ears unto my words,
O Lord, my plaint consider:

to thee I make my prayer.

For I will have respect:
My prayer early in the morn,
to thee for to direct.

in thee my God alone:
That art not pleased with wickedness,
and ill with thee dwel'th none.

these furious fools, O Lord:
Vain workers of iniquity,
thou have always abhord.

thou shall destroy them than:
And God will hate the blood-thirstie,
and the deceitful man.

trusting upon thy grace:
And reverently will worship thee,
toward thine holy place.

for to confound my foes:
And eke the way that I shall walk,
before my face disclose.

their heart is foul and vain:
Their throat an open sepulcher,
their tongues do gloss and feign.

that they may come to naught:
Subvert them in their heaps of sin,
which have rebellion wrought.

let them be glad always:
And render thanks for thy defense,
and give thy Name the praise.

the just and righteous still:
And with thy grace as with a shield,
defend him from all ill.
PSALM VI.
^LOrd in thy wrath reprove me not, though I deserve thine ire: Nor yet
correct me in thy rage, O LORD, I thee desire. For I am weak therefore, O
LORD, of mercy me forbear: And heal me, LORD, for why? thou know, my
bones do quake for fear.


and vexed vehemently:
But, Lord, how long will thou delay,
to cure my misery?

my silly soul up take:
Oh, save me, not for my deserts,
but for thy mercies sake.

remembers thee one whit:
Or who shall worship thee, O Lord,
in the infernal pit?

that I wax wondrous faint:
All the night long I wash my bed,
with tears of my complaint.

with anguish of mine heart:
For fear of those that be my foes,
and would my soul subvert.

that work iniquity,
For why? the Lord has heard the voice,
of my complaint and cry.

and prayer of mine heart,
But it received at mine hand,
and took it in good part.

the Lord will soon defame,
And suddenly confound them all,
to their rebuke and shame.
PSALM VII.
^O LORD my GOD, I put my trust, and confidence in thee: Save me from them
that me ^pursue, and eke deliver me:


the thing that is not right:
Or else if I be found in fault,
or guilty in thy sight:

or left him in distress:
Which me pursude most cruelly,
and hated me causeless:

and eke my life down thrust,
Unto the earth, and also lay
mine honor in the dust.

and put my foes to pain:
Perform thy Kingdom promised,
to me which wrong sustain.

and know thee by this thing:
If thou declare for love of them,
thy self as Lord and King.

O Lord, now judge thou me:
According to my righteousness,
and mine integrity.

and be the just man's guide:
By whom the secrets of all hearts,
are searched and discride.

in all my grief and smart:
That does preserve all those that be
of pure and perfect heart.

God judges by his power:
So that he feel'th his mighty hand,
even every day and hour.

for even as he should smite,
He whets his sword, his bow he bendes,
aiming where he may hit.

his arrows kiene and sharp:
For them that do me persecute,
whiles he does mischief warpe.

of his deuilish forecast:
And of his mischief once conceived,
yet brings forth naught at last.

in hope to hurt his brother:
But he shall fall into the pit,
that he dug up for other.

of him in whom it bred:
And all the mischief that he wrought,
shall fall upon his head.

that judges righteouslie:
And with my song will praise the Name
of him that is most hie.
PSALM VIII.
^O God out Lord, how wonderful, are thy works every where! Whose fame
surmountes in dignity, above the heavens clear.


the works of thine own hand:
The Sun, the Moon, and all the stars,
in order as they stand:

that thou do him remember?
Or what is man's posterity,
that thou do it consider?

then Angels in degree:
And thou have crowned him also,
with glory and dignity.

of all thy works of wonder:
And at his feet have set all things,
that he should keep them under,

that in the fields do feed:

and all that therein breed.

O God, that art our Lord,
How famous and how wonderful,
are thy works through the world!
PSALM IX.
^WIth heart and mouth unto the Lord, will I sing laud and praise: And speak
of all thy wondrous works, and them declare always.


and turned unto flight:
They fall down flat, and are destroyde,
by thy great force and might.

my grief, and all my grudge:
Thou do with justice hear my cause,
most like a righteous Judge.

and wicked so confound:
That afterward the memory,
of them cannot be found.

and all our towns destroide:
Thou have their fame with them defaced,
through all the world so wide.

for evermore shall reign:
And in the seat of equity,
true judgment will maintain.

the world and every wight:
And so will yield with equity,
to every man his right.

what time they be oppressed:
He is in all adversity,
their refuge and their rest.

therefore shall trust in thee:
For thou forsakest not their suit,
in their necessity.

that dwelles in Sion hill:
Publish among all Nations,
his noble acts and will.

of those that be oppressed:
Forgetting not the afflicted heart,
that seeks to him for rest.

whose enemies still remain:
Which from the gates of death are wont,
to raise me up again:

thy praise with heart and voice:
And that in thy salvation, Lord,
my soul might still rejoice.

that they themselves preparde:
And in the net, that they did set,
their own feet fast are snarde.

for every man to mark:
When as ye see the wicked man,
lie trapt in his own warke.

go down to hell for ever:
And all the people of the world,
that will not God remember.

the poor man's grief and pain:
The patient people never look,
for help of God in vain.

that be of worldly might:
And let the heathen folk receive,
their judgment in thy sight.

into the hearts of them:
That they may know assuredly,
they be but mortal men.
PSALM X.
Sing this as the 2. Psalm.
WHat is the cause that thou, O Lord,
art now so far from thine?
And keep close thy countenance,
from us this troublous time.

and wicked men's desire:
Let them be taken in the craft,
that they themselves conspire.

th'vngodly does delight:
So does the wicked praise himself,
and does the Lord despite.

he serteth all apart:
Nay, nay, there is no God, says he:
for thus he thinks in heart.

he does thy Laws neglect:
And with a blast does puff against,
such as would him correct.

lest mine estate should change;
And why? for all adversity,
to him is very strange.

of fraud, deceit and guile:
Under his tongue does mischief sit,
and travel all the while.

to slay the innocent:
Against the poor that pass him by,
his cruel eyes are bent.

ly -- th lurking in his den,
(If he may snare them in his net)
to spoil poor simple men.

he croucheth down, I say,
So are great heaps of poor men made,
by his strong power his prey.

therefore may I be bold,
His countenance is cast aside,
he does it not behold.

the poor man's hope does rest,
Lift up thine hand, forget not, Lord,
the poor that be oppressed.

Lord, do thou not abhor it?
To hear the wicked in their hearts,
say, tush, thou cares not for it?

and well do understand,
That friendlesse and poor fatherless,
are left into thine hand.

then break the power for ever,
That they with their iniquity,
may perish altogether.

as King and God alone,
And he will chase the heathen folk,
out of his land eachone.

their prayers and request,
Their hearts thou will confirm, until
thine ears to hear be pressed.

and help them to their right,
That they may be no more oppressed,
with men of wordly might.
PSALM XI.
Sing this as the 2. Psalm.
I Trust in GOD, how dare ye then,
say thus my soul until,
Fly hence as sast as any foul,
and hide you in your hill?

and make their arrows pressed,
To shoot in secret, and to hurt,
the sound and harmless breast.

and clearly brought to naught,
Alas, the just and righteous man,
what evil has he wrought?

most holy and most hie,
And in the heaven has set his seat,
of Royal Majesty,
The poor and simple man's estate,
considers in his mind,
And searches out full narrowly,
the manners of mankind.

the righteous man will use,
But in his heart he does abhor,
all such as mischief muse.

as thick as any rain,
Fire and brimstone, and whirle-windes thick
appointed for their pain.

does rigteousnesse embrace,
And to the just and upright man,
shew'th forth his pleasant face.
PSALM XII.
Sing this as the 7. Psalm.
Help, Lord, for good and godly men,
do perish and decay,
And faith and truth from worldly men
is parted clean away.

his talk is all but vain,
For every man bethinketh how,
to flatter, lie and feign.

and tongues that be so stout,
To speak proud words, and make great brags,
the Lord soon cut them out.

our tongues shall us extol,
Our tongues are ours, we ought to speak,
what Lord shall us control?

of poor and men oppressed,
Arise will I now, says the Lord,
and them restore to rest.

that from the earth is tried,
And has no less then seven times,
in fire been purified.

Lord keep thy promise then,
And save us now, and evermore,
from this ill kind of men.

of mischiefs manyfolde.
When vanity with mortal men,
so highly is extolde.
PSALM XIII.
Sing this as the 6. Psalm.
HOw long will thou forget me, Lord,
shall I never be remembered?
How long will thou thy visage hide,
as though thou were offended?

with care tormented be?
How long eke shall my deadly foe,
thus triumph over me?

and hear me, sore oppressed,
Lighten mine eyes, lest that I sleep,
as one by death possessed,

behold, I do prevail,
Lest they also that hate my soul,
rejoice to see me quail.

mine hope shall never start,
In thy relief and saving health,
right glad shall be mine heart.
I will give thanks unto the Lord,
and praises to him sing,
Because he has heard my request,
and granted my wishing.
PSALM XIV.
^THere is no God, as foolish men, affirm in their mad mood: Their driftes
are all corrupt and vain, not one of them does good.


and truly there was none,
That in the world did any good:
I say, there was not one.

that all work mischief still:
Eating my people even as bread,
not one to seek GODS will?

great fear on them shall fall:
For God does love the righteous men,
and will maintain them all:

to their reproach and shame,
Because they put their trust in GOD,
and call upon his Name.

and when will thou fulfill,
Thy promise made to Israel,
from out of Sion hill?

such as were captives led:
Then Iaakob shall therein rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.
PSALM XV.
^O LORD, within thy Tabernacle, who shall inhabit still? Or whom will thou
receive to dwell, in thy most holy hill?


in body, goods, or name,
Nor willingly does hear false tales,
which might empaire the same.

malicious wicked men,
But those that love and fear the Lord,
he makes much of them.

that keeps faithfully,
Although he make his covenant so,
that he does loss thereby.

his money and his coin,
Nor for to hurt the innocent,
does bryde or else purloyne.

that here is to be done,
Shall never perish in this world,
nor in the world to come.
PSALM XVI.
^LORD keep me, for I trust in thee, and do confess indeed, Thou art my
GOD, and of my good, O LORD, thou have no need.


which run as they were mad,
To offer to the idol gods,
alas, it is to badde.

and offringes of that sort,
I will not touch, nor yet thereof,
my lips shall make report.

of mine inheritance,
And thou art he that does maintain,
my rent, my lot, my chance.

in beawtie does excel.
Mine heritage assignde to me,
does please me wondrous well.

to understand the right.
For by his means my secret thoughts,
do teach me every night.

and trust him over all,
For he does stand on my right hand,
therefore I shall not fall.

do both rejoice together,
My flesh and body rest in hope,
when I this thing consider.

(for, Lord, thou Iouest me)
Nor yet wilt give thine holy one,
corruption for to see.

for all treasure and store.
Of perfect joy, are in thy face,
and power for evermore.
PSALM XVII.
Sing this as the 16. Psalm.
O Lord, give ear to my just cause,
attend when I complain,
And hear the prayer that I put forth,
with lips that do not feign.

proceed always from thee,
And let mine eyes behold, and clear
this my simplicity.

and yet could nothing find,
That I have spoken with my tongue,
that was not in my mind.

and paths perverse and ill,
For love of thy most holy word,
I have refrained still.

stay me, Lord, and preserve,
That from the way, wherein I walk,
my steps may never swerue.

thou will me surely aid,
Then hear my prayer, and weigh right well,
the words that I have said.

that puts their trust in thee,
Declare thy strength, on them that spurn.
against thy Majesty.

the apple of thine eye:
And under covert of thy wings,
defend me secretly.

and daily me annoy:
And from my foes that go about,
my soul for to destroy.

so full and eke so fat:
That in their pride they do not spare,
to speak they care not what.

with craft me to confound:
And musing mischief in their minds,
to cast me to the ground.

that would his prey embrace:
Or lurking like a lions whelpe,
within some secret place.

and cast him at my feet:
Save thou my soul from the ill man,
and with thy sword him smite.

out of these tyrants hands:
Which now so long time reigned have,
and kept us in their bands.
I mean from worldly men, to whom
all worldly goods are rife:
That have no hope nor part of joy,
but in this present life.
Thou of thy store their bellies filst,
with pleasures to their mind:
Their children have enough, and leave
to theirs the rest behind.

behold thy gracious face:
So when I wake, I shall be full,
with thine image and grace.
PSALM XVIII.
^O GOD my strength and fortitude, of force I must love thee: Thou art my
Castle and defense in my necessity,


most worthy to be served:
Then from my foes I am right sure,
that I shall be preserved.

and bound me every where:
The flowing waves of wickedness,
did put me in great fear.

were round about me set:
And for my death there was preparde,
a deadly trapping net.

did pray to God for grace:
And he forthwith did hear my plaint,
out of his holy place.

he made the earth to quake:
Yea, the foundation of the Mount,
of Basan for to shake.

when kindled was his ire:
And from his mouth came kindled coals,
of hot consuming fire.

and bowde the heavens hie:
And underneath his feet he cast,
the darkness of the sky.

full royally he rode:
And on the wings of all the winds,
came flying all abroad.

his hid and secret place:
With waters black, and airie clouds,
environed he was.

in brightness shall appear:
Then clouds consume, and in their stead,
come hail and coals of fire.

disperse them here and there:
And with his often lighteninges,
he puts them in great fear.

and at thy chiding cheer,
The springes and the foundations,
of all the world appear.

to teach me from below:
And plucked me out of waters great,
that would me ouer-flow.

that would have made me thrall:
Yea, from such foes as were too strong
for me to deal withal.

in time of my great grief:
But yet the Lord was my defense,
my succor and relief.

whereas I might be free:
And kept me safe, because he had
a favor unto me.

so did he me regard:
And to the cleanenesse of my hands,
he gave me my reward.

and in his paths have trod:
And have not wauered wickedly
against my Lord my God.

to his Law and Decree,
His statutes and commandementes,
I cast not out from me.

appearde before his face:
And did refrain from wickedness
and sin in any case.

as I have done aright:
And to the cleanenesse of my hands,
appearing in his sight.

be holy (LORD) also:
And with the good and virtuous men,
right virtuously wilt do.

thy love thou will reserve:
And thou will use the wicked men,
as wicked men deserve.

in trouble when they lie:
And do bring down the countenance,
of them that look full hie.

that it shall shine full bright:
The Lord my God will make also
my darkness to be light.

discomfite, Lord, I shall:
By thee I scale and ouer-leape
the strength of any wall.

his word is surely tried:
He is a sure defense to such
as in his faith abide.

for other there is none:
Or else who is omnipotent,
saving our God alone?

is he that I did mean:
That all the ways wherein I walk,
did evermore keep clean.

in swiftness of my pace:
And for my surety brought me forth,
into an open place.

to battle and to fight:
To break insunder bars of brass,
he gave mine arms the might.

thy right hand is my tower:
Thy love and familiarity,
does still increase my power.

the way where I should walk:
So that my feet shall never slip,
nor stumble at a balke.

my foes, that me annoyde:
And from the field do not return,
till they be all destroyde.

that they can rise no more:
For at my feet they fall down flat,
I strike them all so sore.

to war in such a wise,
That they be scattered all abroad,
that up against me rise.

my mortal enemies yoke:
And all my foes thou did divide,
in sunder with thy stroke.

not yet give them relief:
Yea to the Lord they calde for help,
yet heard he not their grief.

I drive them under feet:
And tread them down like filthy clay,
that lies in the street.

that still in strife be led:
And thou do of the heathen folk,
appoint me to be head.

and yet they shall me serve:
And at the first obey my words,
whereas mine own will swerue.

they will not see my light:
But wander wide out of the way,
and hide them out of fight.

most worthy of all praise:
That is my rock and saving health,
praised be he always.

revenged for to be:
And with his only word subdude
the people unto me.

and set me up from those,
That cruel and ungodly were,
and up against me rose.

to thee give thanks I shall:
And sing out praises to thy Name,
among the Gentiles all.

unto the king, I say:
To David thine anointed king,
and to his seed for ay.
PSALM XIX.
^THe heavens and the firmament, do wondrously declare, The glory of GOD
omnipotent, his works, and what they are.


where their sound is not heard:

their knowledge is conferd.
In them the Lord made for the sun,
a place of great renown.

does from his chamber come.
And as a valiant champion,
who for to get a price,
With joy does haste to take in hand,
some noble enterprise.

he compasses about:
Nothing can hide it from his heat,
but he will find it out.

how is his covenant sure:
Converting souls, and making wise,
the simple and obscure:

and glad both heart and mind:
His precepts pure and gives light,
to eyes that he full blind.

and does endure for ever:
The judgementes of the Lord are true,
and righteous altogether.

then fined gold I say:
The honey and the honey comb,
are not so sweet as they.

to have God in regard:
And in performance of the same,
there shall be great reward.

the errors of his life?
Then cleanse my soul from secret sins.
which are in me most rife.

prevail not over me:
And then I shall be innocent,
and great offenses fly.

my words and thoughts eachone:
For my redeemer and my strength,
O Lord, thou art alone.
PSALM XX.
^IN trouble and adversity, the LORD GOD hear thee still, The Majesty of
Iaakobs GOD, defend thee from all ill. ^helpe at every need: And so in Sion
stablish thee, and make thee strong indeed.


that now to him is done:
And so receive right thankefully,
thy burnt offringes each one.

the Lord grant unto thee:
And all thy counsel and devise,
full well perform may he.

our baners shall display,
Unto the Lord, which thy requests,
fullfilled has always.

I know well by his grace,
And send him health by his right hand,
out of his holy place.

and some in horses trust:
But we remember God our Lord,
that keeps promise just.

and stand up steadfastly:
Now save and help us Lord and King,
on thee when we do cry.
PSALM XXI.
^O LORD, how joyful is the King, in thy strength, and thy power: How
vehemently does he rejoice, in thee his Savior?


and blessings manyfolde:
And thou have set upon his head,
a crown of perfect gold.

thereof thou made him sure:
To have long life: yea, such a life,
as ever should endure.

thy benefit and aid:
Great worship, and great honor both,
thou have upon him laid.

that never shall decay:
And with thy cheerful countenance,
wilt comfort him always.

in God for to prevail:
Therefore his goodness and his grace,
will not that he shall quail.

and those that thee withstand:
Find out thy foes, and let them feel,
the power of thy right hand.

in fiery flame and fume:
Thine anger shall destroy them all,
and fire shall them consume.

their fruit that should increase:
And from the number of thy folk,
their seed shall end and cease.

against thine holy Name:
Yet did they fail, and had no power,
for to perform the same.

in a most open place:
And charge thy bow-stringes readily,
against thine enemies face.

in thy strength every hour:
So shall we sing right solemnly,
praising thy might and power.
PSALM XXII.
Sing this as the 21. Psalm.
O God my God, wherefore do thou
forsake me utterly?
And helpest not when I do make
my great complaint and cry.

I do both cry and call:
I cease not all the night, and yet
thou hear not at all.

and holy place do dwell:
Thou art the comfort and the joy,
and glory of Israel.

had all their hope for ever:
And when they put their trust in thee,
thou did them aye deliver.

they called on thy Name:
And for the faith they had in thee,
they were not put to shame.

more like then any man:
An outcast, whom the people scorn,
with all the spite they can.

me walking on the way:
They grinne, they mow, they nod their heads,
and in this wise they say,

his favor, and his love,
Let him redeem and help him now,
his power for to prove.

to take me thou wast pressed,
Thou did preserve me still in hope,
while I did suck her breast.

with thee to have abode:
Since I was in my mothers womb,
thou have been aye my God.

in this my present grief:
Since I have none to be my help,
my succor and relief.

that be full strong of head:
Yea, bulls so fat, as though they had,
in Basan field been fed.

as though they would me slay:
Much like a lion roaring out,
and ramping for his prey.

my joyntes in sunder break,
My heart does in my body melt,
like wax against the heat.

my tongue it cleaves fast,
Unto my jaws, and I am brought,
to dust of death at last.

and wicked counsel eke,
Conspire against me cursedly,
they picrce my hands and feet.

might all my bones have told:
Yet still upon me they do look,
and still they me behold.

in parts among them all:
And for my coat they did cast lots,
to whom it might befall.

from me in my great need:
But rather since thou art my strength,
to help me, Lord, make speed.

by thy might, and thy power.
And keep my soul, thy darling dear,
from dogs that would devour.

me all in sunder shiuer:
And from the horns of Unicorns,
Lord, safely me deliver.

thy Majesty record:
And in thy Church shall praise the Name,
of thee the living LORD.

exalt him Iaakobs seed:
And thou, O house of Israel,
look thou him fear and dread.

he turns not away,
His countenance when they do call,
but grants to their cry.

I will therefore proclaim,
They praise, and keep my promise made,
for setting forth thy Name.

and those that endeavor,
To know the Lord, their heart shall live,
and praise him evermore.

and turn to him for grace:
The heathen folk shall worship him,
before his blessed face.

the Lord shall have therefore:
And he shall be their governor,
and King for evermore.

shall seek and taste also:
And in his presence worship him,
and bow their knees full low.

of life by him must taste:
My seed shall serve and praise his Name,
whilst any world shall last.

that shall be borne hereafter,
His justice and his righteousness,
and all his works of wonder.
PSALM XXIII.
^THe LORD is only my support, and he that does me feed. How can I then
lack any thing, whereof I stand in need?


the tender grass fast by,
And after drives me to the streams,
which run most pleasantly.

then does he me home take,
Conducting me in his right paths,
even for his own Names sake.

yet would I fear none ill:
For by thy rod and sheepe-heardes crook,
I am comforted still.

in despite of my foe:
Thou have my head with balm refresht,
my cup does ouer-flowe.

thy grace shall me defend,
And in the house of God will I,
my life for ever spend.
PSALM XXIV.
Sing this as the 15. Psalm.
TO GOD the earth does appeartaine,
with all things great and small:
The world also is his demaine,
with the indwellers all.

above the salt sea strande:
And stablisht it to abide and last,
and on the flooddes to stand.

into Gods holy hill?
And in his holy place also,
who shall continue still?

whose heart is pure and neat:
Whose mind for vanity not sought,
nor sworn has with deceit.

his blessings him upon,
And righteousness unto him lend,
shall God, who saues alone.

of those that search for thee,
Of them, O Lord, that thy face seek,
who true Israelites be.

ye doors that last for aye,
Be lift, so the King of glory,
shall through you make his way.

the strong and mighty Lord,
Even he that is victorious,
in battle tried by sword.

ye doors that last for aye,
Be lift, so the King of glory,
shall through you make his way.

the Lord of hosts most hie,
Even he is King and shall be aye,
of everlasting glory.
PSALM XXV.
^I Lift mine heart to thee, my GOD and guide most just, Now suffer me to
take no shame, for in thee do I trust.


which harm them wrongfully,
Therefore thy paths, and thy right ways,
unto me, Lord, descrie.

Thou art my God and Savior,
on thee I wait always.

I pray thee, Lord, remember:
And eke thy pity plentiful,
for they have been for ever.

Remember not how ignorant,
I have been of thy truth.
Nor after my deserts,
let me thy mercy find:
But of thine own benignity,
Lord, have me in thy mind.

Therefore the Lord will sinners teach,
and such as go aside.

He will direct in all his ways,

To them that keep his Testament,

O Lord, I thee entreat,
To grant me pardon for my sin,
for it is wondrous great.

To lead his life in such a way,

And unto them he does declare,

For I am poor and desolate,
and comfortless alone.

Bring me out of this misery,
necessity, and need.

mine anguish, and my pain:
Remit my sin, and mine offense,

how they do still increase:
Pursuing me with deadly hate,
that feign would live in peace,

and eke deliver me,
And let me not be ouer-throwne,
because I trust in thee.

me from mine enemies shend,
Because I look as one of thine,

(I mean thy chosen Israel)
from all their pain and grief.
PSALM XXVI.
^LORD be my judge, for lo, my way is upright, just and plain: In GOD my
trust has been for ay, who shall me still sustain,


with men whose works are vain:
The company I did refuse,
of the deceitful train.

their deeds did I refuse:
To them would I not once resort,
which hurtful things devise.

in works that are upright:
Then to thine Altar I make speed,
to offer there in sight:

that does belong to thee:
And so declare how wondrous ways,
thou have been good to me.

to me it does excel:
I have delight, and would be near,
whereas thy grace does dwell.

to sin that bend their will:
Nor yet my life among those men,
that thirst much blood to spill:

of fraud, deceit, and guile:
And their right hand for bribes does pull,
and pluck with wrench and wile.

my time and days to serve:
Have mercy, Lord, and me defend,
so that I do not swerue.

it stands well and right:
Therefore, O GOD, thee will I praise,
in all thy peoples sight.
PSALM XXVII.
^THe LORD my light and health will be, For what then should I be dismayed? My
strength and life also is he, Of whom then should I be afraid?


My heart from fear yet far it is:
Though wars be raised with great boast,
Yet will I surely trust in this:

That I may in his house still dwell,
To see his beauty, passing thought,
His Temple eke which does excel.

His tabernacle shall he hide:
His secret tents shall be my seat,
And on a rock I shall abide.

About my foes, which work such fraud,
With sacrifice, and offringes free,
Within his tents I will him laud.

With mercy hear me when I cry:

With full consent, Lo, hear, quoth I.

Nor in thy wrath thy servant spill:
Thou have me helped, then leave not so,
O God of health, help thou me still.

The Lord yet will me raise and stay:
My foes set snares, me in to take,
But, Lord, lead me in thy right way.

Lord, give me not in any wise:
For witness false, with words unjust,
They seek against me to devise.

But that I did believe to see,
Gods goodness in that land displaide,
Whereas his faithful servants be.

He comfort will thine heart indeed:
Trust in the Lord, and think not long,
For he will surely come with speed.
PSALM XXVIII.
^THou art, O Lord, my strength and stay, the succor which I crave: Neglect

That speak right fair unto their friends,
and think full ill in heart.

And after their inventions,
let them receive their meede.

Therefore will he them and their seed,

how great a cause have I?
My voice, my prayer, and my complaint,
that heard so willingly.

My hope, my help, my hearts relief,
my song shall him confess.

our enemies to resist:
The health and the salvation,
of his elect by Christ.

LORD, bless, guide, and preserve:
Increase them, LORD and rule their hearts,
that they may never swerue.
PSALM XXIX.
^GIue to the Lord ye Potentates, ye Rulers of the world: Give ye all paise,
honor, and strength, unto the living LORD.


even as himself does please:
He does prepare the thunder clappes,
and governs all the seas.

and wondrous excellent:
It is most mighty in effect,
and much magnificent.

the Cedar trees so long:
The Cedar trees of Libanus,
which are most high and strong,

Or else the Unicorn:
Not only trees, but mountains great,
whereon the trees are borne.

that called is Kades.

and makes the covert plain:
Then in his Temple every man,
his glory does proclaim:

ruling the raging sea:
So shall he reign as Lord and King,

The Lord will bless his chosen flock,
with everlasting peace.
PSALM XXX.
^ALl laud and praise, with heart and voice, O Lord, I give to thee, which
did not make my foes rejoice, but have exalted me.

Thou did revive when strength did lack,
and keep'st me from the grave.

the goodness of the Lord:
In memory of his Majesty,
rejoice with one accord.

But in his favor and his grace,
always does life remain.
Though gripes of grief and panges full sore,
shall lodge with me all night:
The Lord to joy shall us restore,
before the day be light.

thus would I boast and say:
Tush, I am sure to feel none ill,
this wealth shall not decay:

had sent me strength and aid:
But when thou turnd'st away thy face,
may mind was sore dismaide.

to thee, O Lord of might:
My God with plaintes I did apply,
and pray'de both day and night.

if death destroy my days?
Does dust declare thy Majesty,
or yet thy truth does praise?

O Lord, I thee defire,
Do not this simple soul forsake,
of help I thee require.

unto a cheerful voice,
The mourning weed thou took'st me fro,
and made me to rejoice.

shall sing unto thee praise:
My Lord, my God, to thee will I,
give laud and thanks always.
PSALM XXXI.
Sing this as the 18. Psalm.
O Lord. I put my trust in thee,
let nothing work me shame:
As thou art just deliver me,
and set me quite from blame.

to help me make good speed:
Be thou my rock and house of stone,
my fence in time of need.

thou art my fort and tower:
For thy Names sake be thou my guide,
and lead me in thy power.

which they for me have laid:
Thou art my strength, and all my care,
is in thy might and aid.

my spirit which is thy due,
For why? thou have redeemed it,
O Lord my God most true.

from things to be abhord,
When they on trifles set their heart,
my trust is in the Lord.

I see it does excel,
Thou see when ought would me annoy,
and know my soul full well.

that would me ouer-charge,
But thou have set me out of band,
to walk abroad at large.

some pity on me take,
Mine eyes wax dim, my might does fail,
my womb for woe does ache.

my years are gone and past,
My strength is gone, and through disdain,
my bones corrupt and waste.

my friends are all dismaide.
My neighbors and my kinsmen borne,
to see me are afraid.

so am I now forgot,
As small effect in me they find,
as in a broken pot.

their threats my mind did fray,
How they conspird and went about,
to take my life away.

not to be ouer-trod,
For I confess and still have said,
thou art my Lord and God.

o Lord, is in thy had:
Defend me from the wrathful rage,
of them that me with-stand.

and show thy joyful face:
And save me Lord, for thy goodness,
thy mercy, and thy grace.

for that on thee I call:
But let the wicked bear their shame,
and in the grave to fall.

which are addict to lies:
And cruelly with pride and spite,
against the just devise.

laid up, and done for them,
That fear and trust in thee, before
the sons of mortal men!

from all proud bragges and wrongs:
Within thy place thou do them hide,
from all the strife of tongues.

on me his grace so far:
Me to defend with watch and ward,
as in a town of war.

lo, see, I am reject:
Yet, Lord, on thee when I did cry,
my plaint thou did accept.

the faithful he does guide:
And to the proud he will repay,
according to their pride.

be bold ye that are just,
For sure the Lord will take your part,
since ye on him do trust.
PSALM XXXII.
Sing this as the 39. Psalm.
THe man is blessed, whose wickedness,
the Lord has clean remitted:
And he, whose sin and wretchedness,
is hid and also covered.

imputes not his sin:
Which in his heart has hid no guile,
nor fraud is found therein.

by silence and constraint:
My bones did wear and waste away,
with daily moan and plaint.

so grievous was and smert:
That all my blood and humors moist,
to dryness did convert.

and all my sins discover:
Then thou, o Lord, did me forgive,
and all my sins pass over.

and seek thee in due time:
So that the floods of waters great,
shall have no power on him.

do compass me about,
Thou art my refuge, and my joy,
and thou do rid me out.

how thou shall Walk aright,
And will thee guide, as I my self,
have learnde by proof and sight.

as is the horse and mule:
Whose mouth without a rain or bit,
from harm thou can not rule.

sorrows and grief sustain,
But unto him that trustes in God,
his goodness shall remain.

ye just lift up your voice,
And ye of pure and perfect heart,
be glad, and eke rejoice.
PSALM XXXIII.
^YEe righteous in the Lord rejoice, it is a seemly sight, That upright men
with thankful voice, should praise the God of might.


with courage give him praise,

his works and all his ways.

he has a great good will,
And with his gifts he does delight,
the earth throughout to fill.

the heavens all were wrought,
Their hoastes and powers euerechone,
his breath to pass has brought.

on heaps within the shore:
And hide them in the depth to be,
as in a house of store.

fear God, and keep his law:
Ye that inhabit in each coaste,
dread him and stand in aw.

at once with present speed:
What he does will, is brought to pass,
with full effect indeed.

the Lord does drive to naught:
He does defeat the multitude,
of their devise and thought.

thy never slack nor swage:
The motions of his mind and will,
take place in every age.

as God and guide is known:
Wnom he does choose of mere accord,
to take them as his own.

on men mortal by birth:

the dwellers on the earth.

For he alone does know the thought,
and working of the same.

shall not prevail at length:
The man that of his might does boast,
shall fall for all his strength.

their sturdy steedes shall sterue:
The strength of horse shall not prevail,
the rider to preserve.

and watch to aid the just:
With such as fear him to offend,
and on his goodness trust.

may set their souls from dread:
And if that dearth the land oppress,
in hunger them to feed.

on God our strength and stay:
He is the shield us to defend,
and drive all darts away.

rejoicing in his might,
For why? in his most holy Name,
we hope and much delight.

still present with us be,
As we always with one accord,
do only trust in thee.
PSALM XXXIV.
^I will give laud: and honor both, unto the LORD always: And eke my mouth
for evermore, shall speak unto his praise.


with me the living LORD:
And let us now exalt his Name,
together with one accord.

he answered me again:
And me relieved incontinent,
from all my fear and pain.

shall see his light most clear:
Their countenance shall not be dashed,
they need it not to fear.

unto the Lord did call:
Who did him hear without delay,
and rid him out of thrall.

his tents in every place:
To save all such as fear the Lord,
that nothing them deface.

that God is good and just:
O happy man, that makes him,
his only stay and trust.

above all earthly thing:
For they that fear the living Lord,
are sure to lack nothing.

and pinde with famine much:
But as for them that fear the Lord,
no lack shall be to such.

and to my word give ear:
I shall you teach the perfect way,
how ye the Lord should fear.

and lead a blessed life:

from all deceit and strife.

and do the godly deed:
Inquire for peace and quietness,
and follow it with speed.

upon the just are bent:
His ears likewise do hear the plaint,
of the poor innocent.

upon the wicked train:
And cuts away the memory,
that should of them remain.

the Lord does hear them so,
That out of pain and misery,
forthwith he lets them go.

to such as be contrite:
He saues also the sorrowful,
the meek and pure in sprite,

that righteous men do suffer:
But out of all adversities,
the Lord does him deliver.

his very bones always:
that not so much as one of them,
does perish or decay.

which he himself has wrought:
And such as hate the righteous man,
shall soon be brought to naught.

the Lord does save them sound:
And whom that put their trust in him,
nothing shall them confound.
PSALM XXXV.
^LOrd plead my cause against my foes, confound their force and might: Fight on
my part against all those, that seek with me to fight.


mine enemies to with-stand:
Then, Lord, unto my soul thus say,
I am thy help at hand.

that seek my soul to spill:
Let them turn back, and fly with shame,
that think to work me ill.

as chafe let them be tossed:
And by the Angel of our God,
dispersed, destroyde, and lost.

and slippery like to fall:
And send thine Angel with thy might,
to persecute them all.

in secret set their grin:
And for no cause have digde a cave,
to take my soul therein.

O Lord, destroy them all:
Let them be trapt in their own snare,
and in their mischief fall.

in God have joy and wealth:
That in the Lord I may rejoice,
and in his saving health.

my parts shall all agree:
O Lord, though they do seem full gay,
what man is like to thee?

that are both stout and strong:
And rid the poor from wicked men,
that spoil and do them wrong.

to witness things untrue:
And to accuse me did devise,
of that I never knew.

they quite me with disdain,
For their intent was how to spill,
and bring my soul in pain.

and clad my self in sack,
With fasting I my self low brought,
to pray I was not slack.

I did my self behave,
And as one making woeful cheer,
about his mothers grave.

and gather on a rout:
Yea abject slaves at me did toy,
with mockes and checkes full stout.

at feasts did me deride:
They gnasht their teeth with great disdain,
and wryde their mouth aside.

why do thou stay and pause?
Oh, rid my soul repleat with fear,
out of these Lions claws.

before thy Church always:
And where in preasse the people be,
there will I show thy praise.

which hate me for no fault:
Nor yet to wink or turn their eye,
that causelese me assault.

their talk is all untrue:
They still consult, and would betray,
all those that peace ensue.

they gape, they laugh, they fliere:
Well, well, say they, our eye does see,
the thing that we desire.

cease not this gear to mend:
Be not far off, nor me forsake,
as men that fail their friend.

defend me in my right:
Revenge my cause, my Lord my God,
and aid me with thy might.

my Lord God set me free:
And let not them their pride express,
nor triumph over me.

there, there, this gear goes trim:
Nor give them cause to say on hie,
we have our will on him.

that joy when I do mourn:
And pay them home with spite and blame,
that brag at me with scorn.

which love mine upright way:
And they all times with heart and voice,
shall praise the Lord and say.

for why? he does delight:
To see his servants prosper well,
that is his pleasant sight.

thy righteousness to praise:
Unto the Lord my God will I,
sing laud and thanks always.
PSALM XXXVI.
^THe wicked deeds of the ill man, unto mine heart do witness plain, That
fear of God in him is none:


With ignorance he is repleat,
And to do good he has no will:

full bent to seek the way most ill.

Thy faithfulness the clouds do preach,

Thy judgments deep no tongue can teach,
To man and beast thou art refuge.

The sons of men do trust in thee:

And thou will give them drink full free,
Of pleasant rivers largely spread.

Thy brightness does give us our light,

As knowledge thee with heart upright,
Thy righteousness to such men lend.

Nor vain men's power make me to quail,
But lo, they fail in their devise:
They mischief work with tooth and nail,
And fall, but can by no means rise.
PSALM XXXVII.
^GRudge not to see the wicked men, in wealth to flourish still: Nor yet envy
^such as to ill, have bent and set their will.


to do well give thy mind:
So shall thou have the land as thine,
and there sure food shall find.

and look what thou would have,
Or else can wish in all the world,
thou needst it not to crave.

on God with perfect trust:
And thou shall see with patience,
the effect both sure and just.

he will clear as the light:
So that the Sun, even at noone day,
shall not shine half so bright.

on God see thou wait then:
Not shrinking for the prosperous state,
of lewd and wicked men.

at least in any wise:
Their wicked steps avoid and flee,
and follow not their guise.

destory, both more and less:
But such as trust in him, are sure
the land for to possess.

no more the wickeds train:
No, not so much as house or place,
where once he did remain.

enjoy shall sea and land:
In rest and peace they shall rejoice,
for naught shall them with-stand.

against the just conspire:
They gnash their teeth at him as men,
which do his bane desire.

the Lord laugh'th them to scorn:
For why? he sees their term approach,
when they shall sigh and mourn.

their bow eke have they bent:
To ouer-throw and kill the poor,
as they the right way went.

which was to kill the just:
Likewise the bow shall break to shiuers,
wherein they put their trust.

is better a great deal more,
Then all these lewd and wordly men's
rich pomp and heaped store.

God will it ouer-throw:
Where contrary he does preserve,
the humble men and low.

the good men's trade and way:
And will give them inheritance,
which never shall decay.

when some are hard bested,
When other shall be hunger-bit,
they shall be clad and fed.

and enemies to the Lord:
Shall quail, yea melt, even as lambs grease,
or smoke that flies abroad.

and never pays again,
Whereas the just, by liberal gifts,
makes many glad and feign.

the land for heritage,
And they whom he does curse likewise,
shall perish in his rage.

and gives him good success:
To every thing he takes in hand,
he sends good address.

not utterly to quail:
Because the Lord stretch'th out his hand,
at need, and does not fail.

yet did I never see,
The just man left, or else his seed,
to beg for misery.

and lends whereas is need:
His children and posterity,
receive of God their meed.

and virtue do embrace:
So God shall grant thee long to have,
in earth a dwelling place:

and shows to his such grace:
That he preserves them always,
but stroyeth the wicked race.

inherit shall the land,
Having as lords all things therein,
in their own power and hand.

of matters wise and hie:
His tongue does talk to edify,
with truth and equity.

his Lord does still abide:
So that where ever he goes or walk'th,
his foot can never slide.

the just man does beset:
By all means seeking him to kill,
if he fall in his net.

yet God would succor send:
Though men against him sentence give,
God would him yet defend.

he shall preserve thee then:
The earth to rule, and thou shall see,
destroy de these wicked men.

and placed in high degree:
Flourishing in all wealth and store,
as does the Laurel tree:

and lo, he was quite gone:
Then I him sought, but could scarce find,
the place where dwelt such one.

how God does him increase:
For the just man shall have at length,
great joy with rest and peace.

destroyde they shall all be:
God will cut off their budding race,
and rich posterity.

does come from God above:
Who in their trouble send'th them aid,
of his mere grace and love.

from lewd men and unjust,
And still will save them, whiles that they
in him do put their trust.
PSALM XXXVIII.
Sing this as the 6. Psalm.
PVt me not to rebuke, O LORD,
when kindled is thine ire:
Nor in thy fury me correct,
O Lord, I thee desire.

thine arrows sharp and kiene,
And on my back thine heavy hand,
to lie may well be seen.

no health my flesh is in:
Nor in my bones, rest, less or more,
by reason of my sin.

above my head are gone,
A greater lode then I can bear,
they lie me sore upon.

as loathsome is to see,
Which all through mine own foolishness,
betideth unto me.

through this my great distress:
That I pass over all the day,
with plaintes and heaviness,

my loins are whole repleat,
And in my flesh no part at all,
is sound, or yet complete.

and broken eke so sore,
That even for very grief of heart,
I am compeld to roar.

are open in thy sight,

mine eyes have lost their light.

flee this my plague and grief,
My kinsfolk they aloof do stand,
and show me no relief.

and they that sought the way,
To do me hurt, spoke lies, and thought,
on treason all the day.

that could not hear at all,
And as one dumb, that opens not,
his mouth to speak withal.

that answers not again,
When he reproved is, such like,
am I become certain.

I wait, and do attend:
Thou will me hear, my Lord my God,
and succor to me send.

my foes should me despise:
Rejoicing when they see me slip,
who then against me rise.

to halte most shamefully,
And ever present me before,
is my great misery.

in humble wise confess,
And while I for my sinful deeds,
my sorrow do express.

and mighty are also:
And they that hate me wrongfully,
in number hugely grow.

that ill for good repayes,
Because I follow with mine heart,
and ensue goodness ay.

be not far off away,
With speed make haste unto my help,
O God my health and stay.
PSALM XXXIX.
Sing this as the 29. Psalm.
I Said; I will look to my ways,
for fear I should go wrong:
I will take heed all times, that I
offend not with my tongue.
As with a bit I will keep fast,
my mouth with force and might:
Not once to whisper all the while,
the wicked are in sight.

but kept me close and still:
Yea, from good talk I did refrain,
but sore against my will.

with musing, thought, and doubt,
Which did increase and stir the fire,
at last these words brast out.

which yet I have not past:
So that I may be certified,
how long my life shall last.

in length much like a span:
Mine age is nothing unto thee,
so vain is every man.

in vain himself annoy,
In getting goods, and can not tell,
who shall the same enjoy.

what help do I desire?
Of truth my hope does hang on thee,
I nothing else require.

Lord, quite me out of hand:
And make me not a scorn to fools,
that nothing understand.

complain, my lips not move,
Because I knew it was thy work,
my patience for to prove.

I can them not with-stand,
For I consume and pine with fear,
of thy most heavy hand.

he waxes woe and wanne,
As does a cloth that mothes have fret,
so vain a thing is man.

regard my tears that fall,
I soiourne like a stranger here,
as did my fathers all.

my strength for to restore.
Before I go away from hence,
and shall be seen no more.
PSALM XL.
Sing this as the 35. Psalm.
I Waited long, and sought the Lord,
and patiently did bear,
At length to me he did accord,
my voice and cry to hear.

out of the mire and clay,
and on a rock he set my feet,
and he did guide my way.

which I must show abroad,
And sing new songs and thanks always,
unto the Lord our God.

as people much afraid,
Then they unto the Lord will flee,
and trust upon his aid.
O blessed is he, whose hope and heart,
does in the Lord remain,
That with the proud does take no part
nor such as lie and feign.

in greatness far do pass,
Thy favor toward us exceeds,
all things that ever was.
When I intend and do devise,
thy works abroad to show,
To such a reckoning they do rise,
thereof none end I know.

(mine ears well understand)
Nor sacrifice for sin with fire,
thou did at all demand.

I come, O Lord, to thee,
For in the volume of thy book,
thus is it writ of me.

thy will to do like well,
For in my heart thy Law I find,
fast placed there to dwell.

in great resortes I tell:
Behold, my tongue no time does cease,
O Lord, thou know full well.

thy goodness as by stealth:
But I declare, and have expressed,

The trust that in thy truth I find,

But let thy love and verity,

My sins such hold have taken me on,

Yea, they in number far exceed,

So that mine heart does faint for dread,
that I almost am dead.

O Lord, I thee require,
Make haste with aid to succor me,
O Lord, at my desire.

Drive back my foes, and them defame,
that wish and would me ill.

Which at me thus do rail and cry,

That such as love thy saving health,
may say, to God be praise.

Yet thou, O Lord, wilt me restore,

For why? thou art my hope and trust,

Wherefore, my God, as thou art just,
with me no time delay.
PSALM XLI.

And thou, O Lord, wilt turn to health,

And heal my soul, which is full woe,
that I offended thee.

and thus of me did say,
When shall he die, that all his name,

they ask if I do well,
But in their hearts mischief they hatch,
and to their mates it tell.

And cast their fetches, how to trap
me with some mortal harm.

He is so low, that without doubt,

When that mine enemies have no cause,

When wicked men cry out so fast,
where is now God thy guide?

Therefore my soul as at pits brinke,

When I did march in good array,
well furnished with my train,
Unto the Temple was our way,

Likewise by night I did not cease,

O Lord, thou art my guide and stay,
my rock, and my defense.
Why do I then in pensiveness,
hanging the head, thus walk,
While that mine enemies me oppress,
and vex me with their talk?

with panges to be abhord:
When they cry out with stubborn hearts,
where is thy God, thy Lord?

my soul with pains oppressed?
With thoughts why do thy self assail,

Trust in the Lord thy God always,
and thou the time shall see:
To give him thanks with laud and praise,
for health restorde to thee.
PSALM XLIII.

Amongst the Heathen every where,

and as a thing of naught:
For profit none thou had thereby,
no gain at all was sought.

And those that round about us dwell,
at us do grinne and mock.

They mock, they scorn, and nod their heads,

Yea, I so blush, that all my face,
with red is covered then.

That death it is to see their wrongs,
their threatninges and their cries.

nor yet thy paths forsake.

where dens of dragons be:
And covered us with shade of death,
and great adversity.

and help of idols sought:

for he does know our thought.

always are we slain thus:
As sheep unto the shambles sent,
right so they deal with us.

and leave us not for all:

and do forget our thrall?

Our belly like as it were glude,
unto the ground cleaues fast.

We thee beseech for thy goodness,
to rescue us with speed.

To judge his folk,

All beasts are mine,

For all is mine,

Why do thou preach,

Seeing thou have,

Thou runnest with him,
and so your prey do seek,
And art all one,

And how thy tongue
deceives, it is a wonder.

And how to put,
thy mothers son to shame.

Thou did me judge,

Like to thy self:

Once shall thou feel,

And fears not when,

Lest without help,

PSALM LI.
^O LORD, consider my distress, And now with speed some pity take: My
^sinnes deface, my faults redress, Good Lord for thy great mercies sake.


Me to acknowledge mine excess:
My sin, alas, does still remain,
Before my face without release:

Committing evil in thy sight:
And if I were therefore condemned,
Yet were thy judgementes just and right.

That first I was conceiu'de in sin:
Yea, of my mother so borne was,
And yet vile wretch remains therein.

The inward truth of a pure heart,
Therefore thy wisdom from above,
Thou have reuealde me to convert.

I shall be cleaner then the glass,
And if thou wash away my spot,
The snow in whiteness shall I pass.

That inwardly I may find grace:
And that my strength may now amend,
Which thou have swagde for my trespass.

(For I have felt enough thy hand)
And purge my sins I thee desire,
Which do in number pass the sand.

And frame it to thy holy will:
Thy constant Sprite in me let rest,
Which may these raging enemies kill.

But speedily my torments end:
Take not from me thy Sprite and grace,
Which may from danger me defend.

Which I was wont in thee to find:
And let me thy free Sprite retain,
Which unto thee may stir my mind.

I shall instruct others therein:
And men that are likewise brought low,
By mine example shall flee sin.

Forgive me this my bloody vice:
My heart and tongue shall then accord,
To sing thy mercies and justice.

O Lord, which art the only kay:
And then my mouth shall testify,
Thy wondrous works and praise always.

I would have offered many one,
But thou esteemest them of no price,
And therein pleasure take none.

O Lord, thou never do reject:
And to speak truth it is the best,
And of all sacrifice the effect.

Power out thy mercies on thine hill:
And on Jerusalem thy grace,
Build up the walls, and love it still.

Of peace and righteousness, I say:
Yea, calves, and all that thou do crave,
Upon thine altar shall we lay.
PSALM LII.
^WHy do thou tyrant boast abroad, thy wicked works to praise? Do thou
not know there is a GOD, whose mercies last always? Why does thy mind yet
still devise, such wicked wyles to warpe?


and wilt not walk upright?
Thou have more lust false tales to find,
then bring the truth to light.

in mischief, blood, and wrong:
Thy lips have learnde the flattring style,
O false deceitful tongue!

and pluck thee from thy place:
Thy seed root out from off the ground,
and so shall thee deface.

with fear shall praise the Lord:
And in reproach of thee withal,
cry out with one accord:

the Lord for his defense:
But of his goods his god did make,
and trust his corrupt sense.

shall spring and spread abroad:
For why? my trust all times has been,
upon the living GOD.

to thee with heart and voice:
I will set forth thy Name always,
wherein thy Saints rejoice.
PSALM LIII.
Sing this as the 14. Psalm.
THere is no God, as foolish men,
affirm in their mad mood:
Their driftes are all corrupt and vain,
not one of them does good.

And saw not one that sought indeed,
th living GOD to find.

and truly there was none:
That in the world did any good,
I say there was not one.

My people, as they feed on bread?
the Lord they call not on.

with trembling all dismaide:
Whereas there was no cause at all,
why they should be afraid.
For God his bones that thee besiegde,
has scattered all abroad:
Thou have confounded them, for they
rejected are of God.

and thou, O Lord, fulfill,
Thy promise made to Israel,
from out of Sion hill.
When God his people shall restore,
that erst was captive led,
Then Iaakob shall therein rejoice,
and Israel shall be glad.
PSALM LIVE.
Sing this as the 27. Psalm.
Save me, O God, for thy Name sake,
And by thy grace my cause defend:
Oh, hear my prayers, which I make,
And let my words to thee ascend.

And tyrants seek my soul to spill:
They set not God before their eyes,
But bent to please their wicked will.

And is with such as do me aid:

Oh, cut them off, as thou have said.

Present full freely in thy sight:
And will thy Name still magnify,
Because it is both good and right.

And kept me from their raging ire:
Yea, on my foes, which did me threat,
Mine eyes have seen mine hearts desire.
PSALM LV.
Sing this as the 35. Psalm.
O GOD, give care, and do apply,
to hear me when I pray:
And when to thee I call and cry,
hide not thy self away.

and answer me again:
With plaintes I pray, full sore oppressed,
great grief does me constrain.

oppress me through despite:
And so the wicked sort likewise,
to vex me have delight.
For they in counsel do conspire,
to charge me with some ill:
And in their hasty wrath and ire,
they do pursue me still.

The terrors and the dread of death,
do work me much unrest.

Such horror whelmeth me withal,
that I no shift can make.

Of some fair dove? then would I flee,
and rest me from those things.

to flee I would not cease:
And I would hide my self, and stay
in some great wilderness.

and not abide behind:
That I were quite and ouer-past,

For I have spyed their city full,
of rapine, strife, and wrong.

In mids of her is mischief stout,
and sorrow eke withal.

her deeds are much too vile:
And in her streets there does remain,
all crafty fraud and guile.

I might it well abide:
From open enemies check and blame,
some where I could me hide.

which friendship did pretend:
And did my secret counfell hear,
as my familiar friend.

in secret and abroad:
And we together often did walk,
within the house of God.

For mischief reigns in their hall,
and parlour where they dwell.

The Lord will hear me by and by,
and he will succor me.

unto the Lord I pray:
When I so instantly have cryde,
he does not say me nay.

Although the number be full great,
that would against me stand.

For since no change is of their state,
they fear not God therefore.

which were in covenant knit:
Of friendship to neglect the bands,
he passes not a whit.

like butter were his words:
Although hia words were smooth as oil.
they cut as sharp as swords.

and he shall nourish thee:
For he will not for aye accord,

He will no guilefull man permit,
to live out half his days.
Though such be quite destroyde and gone,

I shall depend thy grace upon,

PSALM LVI.
Sing this as the 27. Psalm.
O God, to me thy mercy show,
Whom men would swallow and devour,
Each day they strive to bring me low,
Vexing me sore from hour to hour.

For many do against me fight:
O thou most high, yet in this strait,


Because his words are true and just:
And fear no whit what flesh do may,
To me, since I in God do trust.

Are turned to my smart and grief:
Their thoughts echone tend them to wreak,
On me causeless, to my mischief.

Keeping them secret in their strait:
They to my steps take heed always,
For why? to trap my soul they wait.

Because by wrong they much annoy:
But thou, O God, in wrath down cast,
These wicked folk, and them destroy.

And in thy bottell put my tears,
Are they not written great and small,
As thy register witness bears?

Mine enemies then abacke shall flee:
This know I most assuredly,
For God the Lord he is with me.

Because his promises are sure:
To him will I lift up my voice,
Whose word for ever does endure.

I will man's power not fear at all:

To thee I praises render shall.

And keep my feet from slip or fall:
That I may walk before the LORD,
With such as light have over all.
PSALM LVII.
^BEe merciful to me, O GOD, be merciful to me: For why? my soul in all
assaults, shall ever trust in thee. And till these wicked storms be past,
which rise on every side, Under the shadow of thy wings, my hope shall
always bide.

To GOD, who will his work in me,

to save me, and restore,
From the rebukes of wicked men
that feign would me devour.
God will his mercy surely send,
and constant truth also:
To comfort me, and to defend,
against my cruel foe.

amongst these Lions kiene:
That rage and fume like flames of fire,
the sons of men I mean.
Whose teeth are like the grynded spear,
like arrows are their words:
And eke their tongues in forging lies,
are sharp as any swords.

And over all the earth declare,
thy glory, and thy might.

a snare they did lay out:
My soul was pressed down for fear,
which compast me about.
Before me they did dig and cast,
a deep and ugly pit:
Yet now they fallen are at last,
themselves in mids of it.

my heart is ready bent:
I will sing songs and Psalms of praise,
to thee I will present.

my viole and mine harp:
I will get up by break of day,
and of my God will carpe.

And eke amid the Nations great,
of thee shall be my song.

The clouds and elements above,
thy faithfulness do preach.

And over all the earth declare,
thy glory, and thy might.
PSALM LVIII.
^BVt is it true, O froward folk, do ye now justly talk? O sons of men,
in judging thus, do ye uprightly walk? time is spent.


and from the womb they stray:
Yea, from their birth they lewdly err,
and none so lie as they.

by stopping of her ear.

as do the truth devour:
The jaws of these young Lions, Lord,
break down and swage their power.

away so let them pass:
When that thou do thine arrows shoot,
then let them break as glass.

whose nature is to melt:
Or like untimely fruit, whose eyes
no Sun has seen or felt.

till change be made by fire:
So let them, Lord, fade hence, as with
a whirle-winde in thine ire.

And bathe his feet in such men's blood,
with pure effect shall he.

By seeing God to judge the earth,
and yet his flock to save.
PSALM LIX.
^DEliuer me, my GOD of might, From danger of mine enemy: And me defend in
this my right, From them that do against me rise.


Strong men against me do conueene,
Not for the fault that I did make,
That they, O Lord, in me have seen.

Prepare themselves with brags and boastes:
Arise therefore, in my defense,
And them behold, Lord God of hoastes.

That thou all Nations so may try,
To punish them no pity take,
That thus transgress maliciously.

As hungry hounds they houle and cry,
And all the city clean throughout,
From place to place they seek and spy.

Cast out, as they should seem to bear,
Within their mouths sharp edged swords,
For what regard they who does hear.

And at the same shall laugh apace,
The Heathen folk thou shall deride,
Yea, mock and scorn them to their face.

I will refer, O Lord, to thee:
For though for me he be too strong,
Yet God will my defender be.

Whose mercies I have found of old:
God will my foes echone deface,
So that mine eyes shall it behold.

My people should forget, and light:
Disperse them, Lord, our shield and slay,
And bring them low by thy great might.

The sins of their own mouth, even that
Whereto their lips were ay applide,
Perjured lies then let them prate.

That they henceforth no more be kend,
That men may know how great empire,
Has Iaakobs God to the worlds end.

Like barking dogs, which houle and cry,
When they run here and there for lack,
The town about their prey to spy.

To seek their food, with need oppressed:
Before they filled be with meat,
Although the night drive them to rest.

And early will thy mercies praise:
For thou have aye been my strong tower,
And refuge in my troublous days.

Therefore, sing Psalms incessantly,
For God is my defense, and still
A God most merciful to me.
PSALM LX.
Sing this as the 49. Psalm.
O Lord, thou did us clean forsake,
and scatteredst us abroad:
Such great displeasure thou did take,
return to us, O GOD.

that it in sunder brake:
The hurt, therefore, O Lord, restore,
for it does bow and quake.

the people that are thine:
And thou have given unto us,
a drink of giddie wine.

a banner thou did show:
That they may triumph in the same,
because thy word is true.

thy folk that favor thee:
That they thy help at hand may have,
O Lord, grant this to me.

within his holy place,
That I shall Sichem land divide,
and Succothes vale by pace.

Manasses mine beside:

And Palestina see thou seek,
for favor me unto.

Or who to Edom will me guide,
so that I go not wrong?

Our wars in hand that would not take,
nor walk among our hoastes.

from them that us disdain:
The help that hoastes of men can give,
it is but all vain.

to take great things in hand:
He will tread down, and put to flight,
all those that us with-stand.
PSALM LXI.
^REgard, O LORD, for I complain, and make my suit to thee: Let not my words
return in vain, but give an ear to me.

Upon the rock of thy great power,
my woeful mind repose:

my fence against my foes.

for ever to endure:
Under thy wings I know right well,
I shall be safe and sure.

and grantedst eke the same:
And with an heritage have blessed,
all such as fear thy Name.

a life full long to see:
To many ages shall his days,
and years prolonged be.

before the LORD for aye:
O let thy mercy, truth, and grace,
defend him from decay.

with praise unto thy NAME:
That all my vows I may fulfill,
and daily pay the same.
PSALM LXII.
^ALthough my soul, has sharply been assaulted, Yet toward GOD, in
silence have I walked: In whom alone, all health and hope I see:


of mischief thus be musing?
Thereby not mine,
but your own deaths procuring:
For ye shall be,
like to a rotten wall.

consult for to displace him,
And by their lies,
from dignity to chase him:
With mouth they bless,
their hearts repleat with gall.

in silence wait GODS leisure:

my strength, and only treasure:
Therefore my foes,
I need nothing to fear.
In GOD the LORD,
my saving health is certain,
My glory does,
to him also appertain:
He is my rock,
I trust he will me hear.

ye people sore oppressed,
Show him your grief,
he will it see redressed:
For he alone,
our hope must be, and stay.

men's sons are mere vanity,
Such liars are,
as pretend most gravity,
Yea, vanity,
in weight them down will wey.

in wicked oppression,
And be not vain,
nor yet want discretion:
If riches grow,
set not your hearts thereon.

spoke thus within my hearing:
That power to him,
alone was appertaining,
And that all should,
depend well thereupon,

to thine thy mercy show:
And as men be,
so thou their works rewardest.
PSALM LXIII.
Sing this as the 44. Psalm.
O GOD, my GOD, I watch betime,
to come to thee in haste:
For why? my soul and body both,
do thirst of thee to taste.
And in this barren wilderness,
where waters there are none:
My flesh is parcht for thought of thee,
for thee I wish alone,

thy glory, strength, and might:
As I was wont it to behold,
within thy Temple bright.

this life and wretched days:
My lips, therefore, shall give to thee
due honor, laud, and praise.

to worship thee always:
And in thy NAME I shall lift up,
my hands, when I do pray.

that is both fat and sweet:
My mouth, therefore, shall sing such songs
as are for thee most meet.

and eke all the night tide:

thou art my joyful guide.

thy right hand is my power,

them death shall soon dououre.

their carcases shall feed:
The hungry foxes, which do run,
their prey to seek at need.

that do profess Gods word,
For liars mouths shall then be stopped,
which have the truth disturbde.
PSALM LXIV.
Sing this as the 18. Psalm.
O LORD, unto my voice give ear,
with plaint when I do pray:
And rid my life and soul from fear,
of foes that threat to slay.

which in deceits do lurk:
And from the frowning face of them,
that all ill feats do work:

men whet and sharp their swords:
They shoot abroad their arrows keen,
I mean most bitter words.

the up -- right man to hit:
The just unware to strike by craft,
they care and fear no whit.

in counsel thus they cry,
To use deceit, let us not dread,
what? who can it espy?

all times within their heart:
They all consult, what feats to use,
each does invent his part.

when they think least upon,
God with his dart shall them assail,
and wound them every one:

shall work themselves such blame,
That they shall flee which see their fall,
and wonder at the same.

that God the thing has wrought:
And praise his witty works, and tell
what he to pass has brought.

still trusting in his might:
So shall they joy with mind and voice,
whose heart is pure and right.
PSALM LXV.
Sing this as the 30. Psalm.
THy praise alone, O Lord, does reign,
in Sion thine own hill:
Their vows to thee they do maintain,
and their behestes fulfill.

and do thereto agree:
Thy people all, both far and near,
with trust shall come to thee.

they power have over me:
But thou shall mercy us accord,
although we sinful be.

within thy court to dwell:
Thy house and Temple he shall use,
with pleasures that excel.

our health of thee does rise:
The hope of all the earth abroad,
and the sea coasts likewise.

and compast with his power:
He makes the mountains strong and stout,
to stand in every stoure.

and makes their streams full still:
He does restrain the peoples rage,
and rules them at his will.

shall dread thy signs to see:
Thou shall the Morn and Even with mirth,
make pass with praise to thee.

and thirsts more and more:
Then with thy drops thou do apply,
and much increase her store.
The flood of God does ouer-flow,
and so does cause to spring,
The seed and corn which men do sow,
for he does guide that thing:

whereby her cloddes do fall:
Thy drops to her thou do distill,
and bless her fruit withal.

with fair and pleasant crop:
Thy clouds distill their dew apace,
great plenty they do drop.

with fatness they abound:
The hills also for joy shall hop,
so fertile is their ground.

and cover all the earth:
The vales with corn shall so exceed,
that men shall sing for mirth.
PSALM LXVI.
^YEe men on earth, in GOD rejoice, with praise set forth his NAME. Extol his
might with heart and voice, give glory to the same.


shall praise the Name of God:
The laud thereof the world about,
they shall show forth abroad.

what things the Lord has wrought:
Mark well the wondrous works, that he
for man to pass has brought.

the^ein a way they had:
On foot to pass, both fair and dry,
whereof our hearts were glad.

his eyes all things behold:
All such as would him disobey,
by him shall be controld.

due laud and thanks always:
With joyful voice declare abroad,
and sing unto his praise:

and it preserve withal:
He stays our feet, so that no strife,
can make us slip or fall.

if that they will abide:
As worke-men do, when they desire,
to have their silver tried.

where we have been full long:
Our loins likewise they compast are
with chains and fetters strong.

on us to ride and reign:
We went through fire and water then,
and every painful thing.
Yet sure thou do of thy good grace,
dispose it to the best:
And bring us out into a place,
to live in wealth and rest.

to offer, and to pray:
And there I will my self apply,
my vows to thee to pay.

in all my grief and smart:
The vows (I say) that I did make,
in dolor of mine heart.

of incense and fat rams:
Yea, this my sacrifice shall be,
of bullockes, goats, and lambs.

all ye that fear the Lord:
What he for my poor soul has done,
to you I will record.

this mouth to him did cry:
My tongue likewise did speed apace,
to praise him by and by.

in wicked works rejoice:
Or if I have delight to sin,
God will not hear my voice.

and what I did require:
My prayer he did well regard,
and granted my desire.

nor cast me out of mind:
Nor yet his mercy from me shut,
which I do ever find.
PSALM LXVII.
^OVr GOD, that is LORD, and author of grace, Turn to us, poor souls, his
merciful face: His blessings increase, defend us with might, And show ^vs his
love, and countenance bright.


we wander and walk,
Thy ways may be known,
in thought, deed, and talk.
And how thy great love,
to mankind is bent,
Since thy saving health,
to all folk is sent.

O God, let them praise
Thy wonderful works,
and merciful ways:
Yea, let all the world,
both far, wide, and near,
Praise thee their Lord God,
with reverence and fear.

be glad and rejoice:
And praise thee their God,
with heart and with voice,
For thou shall judge all,
with judgment most right:
And likewise on earth,
shall rule by thy might.

whose works pass all same,
Let all people praise,
thy glorious NAME;
All people, I say,
in every place,
Let them give thee praise,
and extol thy grace.

the earth fruit to bear,
Most plentyfully,
and every where:
And GOD, even GOD,
on whom we do call,
His blessing shall give,
and prosper us all.

Gods blessings each one:
And so of his grace,
there shall complain none.
Then all the worlds ends,
and countries throughout,
His marvelous power,
shall fear and redoubt.
PSALM LXVIII.
^LEt GOD arise, and then his foes, will turn themselves to flight: His
enemies then will run abroad, and seatter out of sight.


shall heartily rejoice:
They shall be glad and merry all,
and cheerful in their voice.

who rides on the Sky:
Extol this Name of IAH our GOD,
and him do magnify.

within his holy place:
That Father is of fatherless,
and Judge of widows case.

unto the comfortless:
He brings bondmen out of thrall,
and rebels to distress.

The Egyptians from among,
And broughtst them through the wilderness,
which was both wide and long:

heard were great claps of thunder:
The mount Sinai shook in such sort,
as it would cleave asunder.

abundantly was wesht;
And if so be it barren waxt,
by thee it was refresht.

thou have prepar'de that place:
And for the poor thou did provide,
of thine especial grace.

to magnify his Name:
When as his people triumphs ^^ake,
and purchase brute and fame.

And women which remain at home,
shall help to part the spoil.

your hew should pass the dove:
Whose wings and feathers seem to have,
silver and gold above.

over Kings, both high and low,
Then shall it be like Salmon hill,
as white as any snow.

and in height others pass:
Yet Sion, Gods most holy hill,
does far excel in grace.

and leap for pride together?
This hill of Sion God does love,
and there will dwell for ever.

of warriors good and strong:
The LORD also in Sinai,
is present them among.

and captive led them all:
Who in times past thy chosen flock,
in prison kept and thrall.
Thou made them tribute for to pay,
and such as did repine:
Thou did subdue, that they might dwell,
within thine house divine.

he powers on us such grace:
From day to day he is the God,
of our health and solace.

salvation comes plain:
He is the God by whom we escape,
all dangers, death, and pain.

and break the hairie scalpe:
Of those that in their wickedness,
continually do walk.

my people and my sheep:
And all mine own, as I have done,
from danger of the deep.

of those that hate my NAME.
And dogs shall have their tongues embrude,
with licking of the same.

thine enemies do deface:
And how thou go, as God and King,
into thine holy place.

the minstrels follow after:
And in the mids the damefels play,
with timbrell, and with taber.

O Israel, praise the Lord:
And Iaakobs whole posterity,
give thanks with one accord.

but Judah made their host:
With Zabulon and Nephthalim,
which dwelt about their coast.

so, Lord, make firm and sure:
The Things that thou have wrought in us,
for ever to endure.

give unto thee, O Lord,
For thine unto Jerusalem,
sure promise made by word.
Yea, and strange Kings to us subdude,
shall do like in those days:
I mean to thee they shall present,
their gifts of laud and praise.

these Calves and Bulls of might:
And cause them tribute pay, and daunt,
all such as love to fight.

and presents with them bring:
The Mores most black shall stretch their hands
unto their Lord and King.

give praise unto the Lord:
Sing Psalms to God with one consent,
thereto let all accord:

above the Heavens bright:
Yet by the fearful thunder claps,
men may well know his might.

ascribe to God on hie:
Whose might and power does far extend,
above the cloudie Sky.

is dread for evermore:
The God of Israel giu'th us strength,
praised be GOD therefore.
PSALM LXIX.
^SAue me, O GOD, and that with speed, the waters flow full fast: So nie my
soul do they proceed, that ^I am sore aghast.


my throat is hoarse and dry:
With looking up my sight does fail,
for help to God on hie.

my soul, with hate are led:
In number sure they are no less,
then hairs are on mine head.
Though for no cause they vex me sore,
they prosper, and are glad:
They do compel me to restore,
the things I never had.

thou, Lord, all times can tell:
And all the sin that I commit,
to thee is known full well.

all those that trust in thee:
Let no man doubt, nor shrink away,
for ought that chances me.

that I do bear this blame,
In spite of thee they would me make,
to hide my face for shame.

forsake me on a row:
And as a stranger they me call,
my face they will not know.

that it does pine me much:
Their checkes and tauntes at thee to hear,
my very heart does grutch.

yea, if I weep and moan:
Yet in my teeth this gear is cast,
they pass not thereupon.

in sacke-cloth use to walk:
Then they anon will it pervert,
thereof they jest and talk.

that sat within the gate:
The drunkardes likewise in their song,
of me did talk and prate.

that when it pleases thee:
For thy great truth thou will always,
send down thine aid to me.

from sincking do me keep,
From such as me pursue with ire,
and from the waters deep:

and depth my soul devour:
And that the pit should me confound,
and shut me in her power.

as thou art good and kind:
And as thy mercy is most dear,
Lord have me in thy mind.

nor turn thy face away:
I am oppressed on every side,
in haste give ear, I say.

the same with aid repose:
Because of their great tyranny,
acquit me from my foes.

thou know, and thou can tell:
For those that seek and work the same,
thou see them all full well.

I seek for help anon:
But find no friends to ease my smart,
to comfort me not one.

too cruel for to think:
And gave me in my thirst withal,
strong vinegar to drink.

to take themselves therein:
And when they think full well to fare,
then trap them in the gin.

that they may nothing see:
Bow down their backs, and do them bind,
in thraldom for to be.

that it on them may fall:
Let thy displeasure in thine ire,
take hold upon them all.

their offspring eke expel:
That none thereof possess their place,
nor in their tents do dwell.

on him they lay full sore:
And if that thou do wound the same,
they seek to hurt him more.

since they are all pervert,
That of thy favor and good will,
they never have no part.

of life, of hope, of trust:
That for their names they never look,
in number of the just.

have been full sore oppressed:
Thy help shall give me such relief,
that all shall be redrest.

and show it with a song:
I will extol the same always,
with hearty thanks among:

(such mind thy grace has borne)
Then either ox or calfe can be,
that has both hoof and horn.

it shall rejoice them sure:
All ye that seek the Lord, be bold,
your life for aye shall dure.

the poor when they complain:
His prisoners are to him full dear,
he does them not disdain.

the sea with flood and stream,
His praise they shall declare and show,
with all that live in them.

and Iudahs cities build.
Much folk possession there shall have,
her streets shall all be filled.

all ages out of mind,
And there all they that love his NAME,
a dwelling place shall find.
PSALM LXX.
^MAke haste, O GOD, to set me free, For why? my foes are fiercely bent, For
help with speed I call to thee, O LORD, make haste, my foes prevent.


And turned back with shame indeed,
Which cry, Aha, aha, in scorn,
As though thou could not help at need.

Let those be glad and joy in thee,
And such as thy Salvation love,
Say thus, O GOD, thou praised be.

In needynesse and great distress,
Make haste, therefore, me to sustain,
Delay not, LORD, but send redress.
PSALM LXXI.
^MY trust, O LORD, in thee, I have put evermore: Oh! let me never take the
foil, nor shrink for shame therefore,


that aye I may be bold:
Thou have given charge to save me sound,
and art my tower and hold.

from wicked hands me shield:
And from all cruel enemies rage,
which seek to make me yield.

on whom I do depend:
O Lord my God, thou art my trust,
since I did childhood end.

thou wast my stay and guide:
Thou took'st me thence, therefore will I,
thee praise both time and tide.

full many fled me fro:
Yet thou wast my strong hope and trust,
so that I dread no foe.

so shall my mouth burst out:
Thy praises and magnificence,
for ever the world about.

when age creep'th me upon:
Nor yet forsake me in this plonge,
when strength and force is gone.

which seek mine utter shame:
And they which would bereave my life,
devised have the same.

God has him cast away:
Pursue him hard, and hold him fast,
for none him succor may.

and be not far from me,
My God, make haste to help me now,
as mine hope is in thee.

kill them which would me kill,
Let shame and flander bury them,
which would me harm and ill.

I will attend and wait,
Extolling ever more and more,
thy praises high and great.

in number pass my reach,
I daily will thy righteousness,
and thy salvation teach.

in thy great strength and might,
I will record thy bounty great,
and bring it forth to light.

even from my youth thy sawes,
And hitherto I have set forth,
thy divine works and laws.

when head and hair is gray,
Thine arm till I have taught this age,
and ages all for aye.

it is indeed most hie,
For thou have done great things, O GOD,
and who is like to thee?

full great troubles and grief,
But when thou turndst, comfort I felt,
by life thou sendst relief.

thou have increased so,
That by thy loving face, I feel
my self comforted tho.

on viols praise my LORD,
O holy One of Israel,
mine harp shall eke accord.

when I shall tune thy praise,
Likewise my soul by thee redeemde,
the same shall do always.

thy mercies ever and aye,
For such as did procure mine hurt,
shame has brought to decay.
PSALM LXXII.
^LORD, give thy judgementes to the King, therein instruct him well. And with
his son, that princely thing, LORD, let thy justice dwell,


unto their folk give peace,
And eke let little hills apply,
thy justice to increase:

with aid, and make them strong,
And eke destroy for evermore,
all those that do them wrong.

regard and fear thy might,
So long as Sun does shine by day,
or else the Moon by night.

like rain to fields new mowne,
And like to drops that lay the dust,
and fresh the land unsown.

and all shall be at peace,
Until the moon shall leave to prime,
waste, change, and to increase.

from shore to shore throughout,
And from the floods within the land,
through all the earth about.

shall kneel to him full thick,
And all his enemies that rebel,
the earth and dust shall lick.

great gifts to him shall bring,
The kings of Sabe and Arabie,
give many costly thing.

in his good grace to stand,
And all the people of the world,
shall serve him at his hand.

that unto him do call,
And eke the simple folk, that have
no help of man at all.

that are with need oppressed,
He shall preserve them evermore,
and bring their souls to rest.

from fraud, from wrong, from might,
And eke their blood shall be indeed,
most precious in his sight.

to him of Sabaes gold,
He shall be honored as a king,
and daily be extold.

of corn shall bear such throng,
That it like Cedar trees shall stand,
in Libanus full long.
Their cities eke full well shall speed,
the fruits thereof shall pass,
In plenty it shall far exceed,
and spring as green as grass.

while that the sun is light,
And think them happy through the same,
all folk shall bless his might.

to Isreal's GOD each one,
For he does every wondrous thing,
yea, he himself alone.

all times eternally,
That all the earth may praise the same,
Amen, Amen, say I.
PSALM LXXIII.
^HOw ever it be, yet GOD is good, and kind to Israel, And to all such as
safely keep, their conscience pure and well.


I grudgde, and did disdain,
That wicked men all things should have,
without turmoile or pain.

as if death should them smite,
Their bodies are both stout and strong,
and ever in good plight.

when other men be shent,
And with the rest they take no part,
of plague or punishment.

their necks, as does a chain,
And are even wrapped, as in a robe,
with rapine and disdain.

their eyes often times out start,
And as for worldly goods, they have
more then can wish their heart.

boasting much of the wrong,
Which they have done to simple men,
and ever pride among.

they spare not to blaspheme,
And prate they do on worldly things,
no wight they do esteem.

to see their prosperous state,
And almost drink the self same cup,
and follow the same rate.

should know and understand,
These worldly things, since wicked men,
be lords of sea and land?

in riches still increase,
Rewarded well with worldly goods,
and live in rest and peace.

my fantasy refrain?
And wash mine hands with innocents,
and cleanse mine heart in vain?

as subject to all blame?
And every morning from my youth,
sustain rebuke and shame?

mislyking mine estate,
But that I should thy children judge,
as folk unfortunate.

this matter understand,
But yet the labor was too great,
for me to take in hand.

thine holy place, and then
I understood right perfectly,
the end of all these men.

upon a slipperie place,
And at thy pleasure and thy will,
thou do them all deface.

to see how suddenly,
They are destroyde, dispatched, comsumde,
and dead so horribly:

so shall their wealth decay,
Their famous names in all men's fight,
shall ebb and pass away.

my mind was much oppressed,

and in this point a beast.

thou holdst me always fast,

to glory at the last.

but thee in heaven above?
And in the earth there is no thing,
like thee, that I can love.

but God does fail me never:
For of my health God is the strength,
my portion eke for ever.

thou shall destroy each one:
And those that trust in any thing,
saving in thee alone.

and ever with him dwell:
In God alone I put my trust,
thy wonders will I tell.
PSALM LXXIV.
Sing this as the 72. Psalm.
WHy art thou, Lord, so long from us
in all this danger deep?
Why does thine anger kindle thus
at thine own pasture sheep?

which have been thine so long:
The which thou have redeemde and bought,
from bondage sore and strong.
Have mind, therefore and think upon,
remember it full well:
Thy pleasant place, thy mount Sion,
where thou wast wont to dwell.

and all thy foes deface:
Which now at pleasure rob and waste,
within thine holy place.

thine enemies roar, O God:
They set (as signs on every wall)
their banners splayde abroad.

that on the hills do grow,
So shine the bills and swords of these,
within thy Temple now.

the goodly graven stones,
With axes, hammers, bills, and swords,
they beat them down at once.

to ground they have down cast:
The house appointed to thy NAME,
defiled is and waste.

dispatch them out of hand:
Then burnt they up in every part,
God houses through the land.

our Prophets are all gone:
To tell how this our plague shall end,
among us there is none.

and quail thine enemies strong:
Shall they always blaspheme thy NAME,
and rail on thee so long?

and hide it in thy lap?
Oh, pluck it out, and be not slack,
to give thy foes a rap.

and evermore have been:
Yea, thy good grace throughout the world,
for our good help has seen.

thy might did make them dry,
And thou did break the serpents head,
that he therein did die.

of whales that are so fell:
And gave them to those folk to eat,
that in the desert dwell.

from rocks, both hard and hie:
And eke thine hand has made likewise,
deep rivers to be dry.

by thee they were begun:
Thou setst to serve us with their shine,
the light and eke the sun.

of all the earth about:
Both summer heates, and winter frostes,
thy hand has found them out.

thy foes that thee defame:
And how the foolish folk are set,
to rail upon thy NAME.

the turtle, that is true:
Forget not always in thy power,
the poor that much do rue.

thy foes possess the land:
All sad and dark, forworne and old,
our realm as now does stand.

nor yet return with shame:
But let the poor and needy aye,
give praise unto the same.

the cause that is thine own:
Remember how that thou blasphemde
art, by the foolish one.

for the presumption hie,
Is more and more increast of those,
that hate thee spitefully.
PSALM LXXV.
Sing this as the 67. Psalm.
O GOD, laud and praise,
we will give to thee:
Of us at all times,
thou shall thanked be:
Since thy NAME is near,
they will without doubt,
Thy works of great fame,
declare and show out.

a meet time shall see,
I will rightly judge:
for though the earth be,

dissolved and waste,
Her pillars shall I,
make stable and fast.

learn now to be wise:
And to the perverse,
let not your horn rise.

your horns thus on hie:
Nor yet with stiff neck,
speak presumptuously.

proceeds in no part,
From East, nor from West,
nor yet from desert,

who only has power,
To throw and cast down,
or raise up each hour.

a cup now has GOD,
Of strong wine, full mixed,
which he powers abroad.
The wicked each one,
the dregs of that cup,
Shall doubtless wring out,
and drink them all up.

and show forth always,
And to Iaakobs GOD,
will sing laud and praise.

in twain break will I,
But the just men's shall,
be lifted on hie.
PSALM LXXVI.
^IN Jury land GOD is well known, In Israel great is his NAME: ^of great
fame, Therein to raise, and mount Sion, To make his habitation, And residence
within the same.


Their fiery darts so swift of flight:
Their shields, their swords, and al their crafts,
Of war, when they were bown to fight.

Art thou, therefore, then mountains hie,
Of ravenous wolves, void of all right.

A sudden sleep did them confound:
And all the strong men in that fray,
Their feeble hands they have not found.

Horses with chariots ouer-trod,
As with dead sleep were cast to ground.

Yea, thou alone, and who is he,
That in thy presence may abide,
If once thine anger kindled be?

Thy judgementes just: the earth for fear,
Stilled with silence then we see.

Sentence to give, as Judge of all:
And in the earth do enterprise,
to rid the humble out of thrall.

Shall be thy praise: the remnant then,
Of their fury thou bindst withal.

Unto the Lord your God, all ye,
That round about him dwell, adore
This fearful One, with offringes free:

The breath of princes in their rage,
To earthly kings fearful is he.
PSALM LXXVII.
^I With my voice to GOD do cry, with heart and hearty cheer: My voice to
GOD I lift on hie, and he my suit does hear.


my trouble then is more:
I spoke, but could not make an end,
my breath was stopped so sore,

that I always did wake:
With fear I was so sore oppressed,
my speech did me forsake.

and often did think upon,
The times and ages that are past,
full many years agone.

once made thy praise to show:
And with my heart much talk I find,
my spirit does search to know.

cast off his people thus?
So that henceforth no time he shall,
be friendly unto us?

for ever and a day?
Or is his promise now delayde,
and does his truth decay?

Or shall his wrath increase so hot,

GODS mighty hand can help all this,
and change it when he list.

the working of the LORD:
Of all his wonders past and gone,
I gladly will record.

and what he did devise:
To tell his factes I will not spare,
and eke his counsel wise.

and holy all abroad:
What one has strength to match the might,
of thee, O LORD our GOD?

thy wonders every hour:
And so do make the people know,
thy virtue and thy power.

with strength and stretched arm:
The sons of Iaakob, that descend,
and Joseph's seed from harm.

the waters saw thee well:
And they for fear aside did flee,
the depthes on trembling fell.

The thunder in the air did crack,
thy shaftes abroad did fly.

With flashes great made them afeard,
the earth did quake and move.

Yet none can there thy steps epsy,
nor know thy paths to keep.

By Moses and by Aarons hand,
thou did them safely guide.
PSALM LXXVIII.
^ATtend my people, to my Law, and to my words incline:


from them that should come after,
Who should Gods power to their race praise
and all his works of wonder.

Willing our fathers should the same,

Nor yet would walk, or lead their lives,

In Egypt land within the field,

that they might pass at ones:
And made the water stand as still,
as does an heap of stones.

And all the night, when dark it was,
with fire he gave them light.

and gave the people drink:
Als' plentiful, as when the deepes,
do flow up to the brinke.

Of such abundance, that no floods,
to them might be comparde.

their sin they did increase:
And stirred him that is most high,
to wrath in wilderness.

like people of mistrust:
Requiring such a kind of meat,
as served to their lust.

in their unthankfulness:
What? can our GOD prepare for us,
a feast in wilderness?

and floods foorth-with did flow:
But can he now give to his folk,

So did his indignation,

Could always help and succor them,

and brought in the South-west:

and foul as thick as sand:

where all their tents did stand.

and all men had their filles:
Yet more and more they did desire,
to serve their lusts and wills.

his wrath upon them fell:

and choice of Israel.

and still they did him grieve:
For all the wonders that he wrought,
they would him not believe.

and made their honor vain:
Their years did waste and pass away,
with terror, and with pain.

they sought him by and by:

their help and GOD most hie.

and flatter with the LORD:
And with their tongues, and in their hearts,
dissembled every word.

Nor yet to keep, or to perform,
the covenant that was made.

when they deseru'de to die,
That he forgave them their misdeedes,
and would not them destroy.
Yea, many a time he turnde his wrath,
and did himself auise:
And would not suffer all his whole
displeasure to arise.

and even as a wind,
That passes away, and cannot well,

How did they move and stir their LORD,
to plague them with his stroke?

Prescribing to the holy LORD,

Delivered them out of the bonds,

And filde their country full of frogs,
which should their land destroy.

And all the labor of their hands,
he gave to the grasse-hopper.

And not so much as wild figge-trees,

And all their flocks and heardes likewise,
with thunder-boltes full hot.

and in his fury strong,
Displeasure wrath, and evil spirits,

But gave unto the Pestilence,

And all the chief of men and beasts,

And carried them through wilderness,

Whereas their foes with rage of seas,

Even to the mount, which he had got,
by his strong arm and hand.

and did their land divide:
And in their tents he set the Tribes,
of Israel to abide.

And would not keep his Testament,
nor yet obey his will.

even so they went astray:
Much like a bow, that would not bend,
but slipped and start away.

And with their idols vehemently,

The naughtiness of Israel.

To feed his people of Israel,
and his inheritance.

And prudently with all his power,
did govern them indeed.
PSALM LXXIX.
^O LORD, the Gentiles do invade, thine heritage to spoil: Jerusalem an heap

like water spilt they have:
So that there is not one of them,

And show thy wrath as hot as fire,

And aid us, LORD, in all assaults,

In thy reproach rejoice and say.

before our eyes in sight,
Of all these folk thy servants blood,

Of such as are in prison cast,

Which unto death are destinate,

Into their lappes with seven fold,

And teach all ages for to keep,

PSALM LXXXI.
^TO GOD our strength most comfortable, With merry hearts sing and rejoice, To
Iaakobs GOD most amiable, Make melody with cheerful voice.


Let blow the trumpet merrily,
The first day of the month appointed,
Thus to be kept solemnedly:

Israel observed,
This statute of old:
And this is the ordour,
Which their GOD to honor,
Iaakobs seed did hold.

Of Joseph, parting from the land
Of Egypt, where I heard a language
Uncouth and strange to understand.

From the burdens bearing,
His shoulders I took:
And eke the Taske-maister,
The pots and the plaster,
His hands then forsook.

And I did rid thee from distress:
Within the secret of my thunder,
I heard thy grudginges more and less,
I did also prove thee,
My goodness above thee,
When thou did mistrust:
At Meribah chyding,
For waters providing,
To serve thee at lust.

O Israel (if thou would hear)

Nor other gods worship or fear:

Thy great GOD supernall,
Which from Egyptes thrall,
Have brought thee so safely,
Thy mouth open largely,
And fill it I shall.

My voice they would not hear, I say:
And Israel proudely refused,
On me, their loving LORD, to stay.

Even as their hearts gave them,
To serve their ingine,
After lewd intisinges,
Of their own deuisinges,
So did they decline.

To hearken unto me those days.
Oh, if that Israel had taken,
Delight to walk in my true ways.

In a little season,
Their foes to subdue:
And mine hand have turned,
Upon such as spurned,
My Saints to pursue.

But flatter him, by force constrainde,
And a most prosperous time for ever,
Should to my people have remainde.

With most finest wheat bread,
Even at th^ne own will:
And with the sweet honey,
Of the rocks so stony,
I would thee fulfill.
PSALM LXXXII.
^A Mid the preasse, with men of might, the LORD himself did stand, To plead
the cause of truth and right, with judges of the land. 2. How long, said he,

And when the poor man does contend,

And rid the needy from the claws,

They will not see, or ought discern,
but still in darkness walk.
For lo, even now the time is come,
that all things fall to naught:
And likewise Laws, both all and some,

And children to the most of might,

For why? all nations are thine own,

^GOD, for thy grace, thou keep no more silence: Cease not, O GOD, nor hold

With subtle slight,

For such as on,

And of the Name,

Thou did remit, and haste forgot
Such was thy tender love.

Release thine ire, and now at length,

And that from age to age?

But quite cut off, as men most vain.

Where, in the dark, full deep I lie:

That, overcome with grief, I cry.

Whose love is turned to great hate:
I am shut up, all help I lack,
for to redress my dreadful state.

To thee I cry, LORD, day by day,
Mine hands to thee I stretched with care,
But yet can have no rest, nor stay.

Shall dead men rise to praise thy NAME?

With faithfulness may death well frame?

Shall they in darkness deep be known?
Or shall thy righteousness so great,
In a forgetful land be shown?

And early shall I come to pray:

And turn thy face from me away?

Always in dread of life I doubt,

Thy fear almost has worn me out.

Because I should not from them slide,

And mine acquaintance did them hide.
PSALM LXXXIX.
^TO sing the mercies of the LORD, my tongue shall never spare: And with my

And with mine holy oil anoint,

So that his throne shall still remain,
while that the heavens do last.

And of my judgementes have none awe,
nor will not them observe:

my statutes to them made,
And set all my Commandementes light,

And so with scourging for their sin,
when that they do offend.

I will not take him from
Nor handle him with craftiness,
and so my truth forgo.

with all that I have spoke:
No word, the which my lips have told,
shall alter, or be broke.

With David I will keep promise,

As does the Sun, it shall remain,

A faithful witnnesse from on hie,
So shall thy kingdom last.

Yea, thou art wroth with thine Elect,
thine own Anointed dear.

Lord, thou have quite undone:
And down upon the ground also,
have cast his royal crown.

His Bull-warkes thou have beat down right,
and brought them to the ground.

And so is made a mock and scorn,

And all his foes which him devour,

Before his foes, as he was wont,
nor have the upper hand.

By thee is ouer-throwne and cast,
full low upon the earth.

his youth and lusty days,
And raisde of him an ill report,
with shame and great dispraise.

for ever will thou turn?
And shall thine anger still always,
as fire consume and burn?

my time consumes fast,
Why have thou made the sons of men,
as things in vain to waste?

and death shall never see?
Or from the hand of hell his soul,
shall he deliver free?

so often declarde beforne?
Which by thy truth and uprightness,
to David thou have sworn?

that on thy servant lie:
The raylinges of the people all,
bear in my breast do I.

In that their steps, whom thou have chose
and ointed, they defame.

Through Sky and earth in all the costs,
Amen, Amen, I say.
PSALM XC.
Sing this as the 89. Psalm.
O LORD, thou have been our refuge,
and kept us safe and sound,
From age to age, as witness can,

ere thou the earth did frame,
Thou was our great Eternal GOD,
and still shall be the same.

Again thou say, Ye Adams sons,

to count them in thy sight?
But as a day which last is past,
and as a watch by night.

even like a sleep or shade:
Or like the grass, which as we know,
betimes away does fade.

it grows up full green:
By night cut down, it withers, as
no beauty can be seen.

in this thy wrath so hot?
We fear thy fury be so fierce,
that death shall be our lot.

that they are in thy mind:
Our secret sins are in thy sight,
as though none grace should find.

our days consume foorth-with:
Then end our years, as thoughts most vain,
which have in them no pith.

of years ten and threescore:
And if that some by nature strong,
attain to live ten more.
Yet is their strength, brag what they list,
but labor, grief, and care:
And passes hence, to haste their end,
ere they themselves beware.

of this thy wrath so great?
All such truly as do thee know,
thy plagues when thou do threat.

To learn thy wisdom, and thy truth,
for that should be our end.

Be merciful unto thy flock,
and grant them thy good will.

So we rejoice shall all our days,
and eke be glad and sing.

And for the years of our distress,
sustaining such great plagues.

And let thy glory to their seed,

So that thou need'st not fear his net,
Nor yet for plagues no whit to care.

And there thee keep full well shall he,
Thee to defend on either side,
His truth shall still thy buckler be.

For any fear to come by night:
Nor of the arrow be afraid,
That forth is shot when it is light.

Which in the dark does much annoy,
Nor of the plague at noonday clear,
Which does full often great heaps destroy.

And at thy right hand thousands ten:
But unto thee none hurt at all,
Shall once so much as touch thee then,

what recompense the wicked have,

Thou have him made thy soul to save.

Nor yet thy Tabernacle touch:

And gives them charge to keep all such,

That harm thou shall be sure of none:
Nor yet so much as once offend,
Or dash thy foot against a stone.

The Dragon, and the Aspe also,
They shall of thee be still in dread,
Thou shall upon them walk and go:
For so the Lord himself has sworn,

I surely will exalt his horn,
And such confound as seek his shame.

And I will hear him out of doubt:
His troubles end will I with speed,
And will him glorify throughout.

That he the same full well may spend,
My saving health and love entire,
To do him good shall have none end.
PSALM XCII.
Sing this as the 89. Psalm.
A Thing both good and meet truly,
it is to laud the Lord:
And to thy Name, O Lord, most hie,
to sing in one accord.

And eke declare his truth abroad,
when it does draw to night.

on lute and harp so sweet:
With all the mirth ye can invent,
of instruments most meet.

in things so wrought by thee:
And I have joy in heart and voice,
thy handie works to see.

are all thy works so stout!
So deeply are thy counsels set,
that none can try them out.

how this is brought to pass:
Nor yet the idiote fool also,
does understand this case.

as grass do spring full fast:
They, when they flourish in their ill,
for aye shall be made waste.

yea, thou do reign therefore,
In every time eternally,
both now and evermore.

behold thy foes, I say:
How all that work iniquity,
shall perish and decay.

shall lift mine horn on hie:
With fresh and new prepared oil,
thine ointed king am I.

shall see the fall and shame:
Of all that up against me rise,
mine ears shall hear the same.

as Date-trees budde and blow:
And as the Cedars multiply,
in Libanus that grow.

and dwelling of our God:
Within the Courts they spring apace,
and flourish all abroad:

And pleasantly both budde and spring,
with boughs and branches green.

He is my Rock, my hope, and trust,
in him there is none ill.
PSALM XCIII.
Sing this as the 70. Psalm:
THe Lord as King aloft does reign,
in glory goodly dight
And he to show his strength and maine,
has girde himself with might.

No might can make it move or fade,
at stay it does endure.

Beyond allt i am that can be thought,

The floods, I say, did enterprise,

The Lord is strong and more of might,

For just and true they shall it take,

PSALM XCIV.
Sing this as the 41. Psalm.
O Lord, since vengeance does to thee,
and to none else belong:
Now show thy self, O Lord our God,
with speed revenge our wrong.

That as the proud deserve and do,
thou will them so reward.

Yea, Lord, how long? for they triumph,
as though who now but they.

their great disdain we see?
Whose boasting pride does seem to threat,
no speech but theirs to be.

not sparing young nor old:
Thine heritage they so torment,
as strange is to behold.

they murder cruelly,
The fatherless they put to death,
and cause they know not why.

will not behold this deed,
Nor yet will Iaakobs God regard,
the things by us decreede.

among the folk that dwell:
Ye fools, I say, when will ye weigh,
or understand this well?

shall he be slow to hear?
Or he that made the eye to see,
shall he not see most clear?

and knowledge teaches men,
To nurture such as went astray,
shall he not punish then?

his very thoughts does know:
And that they are both vile and vain,
to him is known also.

whom thou do bring in awe:
And teach him by this thy rod,
to love and fear thy Law.

in time of troubles great:
When that the pit is dug up,

Nor yet forsake his heritage,
which he does still approve.

And such as be upright in heart,
thereof full glad shall be.

against this wicked band?
Or who against these workers ill,
on my part stout will stand?

doubtless it had been done:
To wit, my soul in silence brought,
and so my foes had won.

yet when I did it tell,
Thy mercies, Lord, so held me up,
that I therewith not fell.

that did mine heart oppress:
Thy mercies were no me so great,
they did my soul refresh.

with that most wicked chair,
Which forgeth mischief as a law,
without remorse or fear?

they all with speed convent:
And so condemn the guiltless blood,
of the poor innocent.

And God the Rock is of mine hope,
who does me always keep.

and in his wrath them kill:
Yea, them destroy shall GOD our LORD,
for he both can and will.
PSALM XCV.

A King above all gods throughout,

The tops of hills, that are so steep,

The earth and all that therein is,

And kneel to him with one accord,

With one consent my death have sworn,

And blent my cup with tears also.

For thou in high estate me plaste,
And down to dust again have cast.

For lo, the time, the time, I say,
Of mercy, Lord, is come this day:

And pity take upon her dust,

And earthly kings thy glorious fame.

Despising not their suit t'attende.

Yea, people yet uncreated,
The Lords renown abroad shall spread.

From heaven the earth behold did he,

And set the damned free from care,

This holy Name of God always,
And in Jerusalem his praise.

And shorter cut my life and days.

In midst my life let me not die,
Thy years eternally endure,
From age to age abiding sure.

To save and consume things,

To turn his wrath, lest he on them,

And in the midst of all thy mortal foes.

To come and sing to him therefore:
That his great love and tender kindness,
Remains still for evermore.

I then upon the LORD did call:
Who heard my voice, and me vp-raised,
And set at large free from all thrall.

He is with me, my part to take:
No fear, therefore, shall cause me to faint,
Nor ought that man may against me make.

With such as do me help and aid:
So that I shall see my just desire,
Upon my foes, which me vp-braide.

Then to vain man to trust and stand:

Then princes, lords, of sea and land.

With one consent: yet in GODS NAME,
By me they shall be soon destroyed,
And put to flight, rebuke, and shame.

Yea, and shut up with one accord:
Yet they by me shall be destroyed,
Even in ye NAME of GOD the LORD.

But were as fire of thorns put out:
For in GODS NAME, the Everliving,
I shall confound them all, no doubt.

Thrust sore at me, with maine and might:
To cause me fall: but lo, contrary,
For GOD has helped me in my right.

Yea, he my song is of pleasance:
For he has been in all adversity,
Mine helper and deliverance.

Within the just man's dwelling place:
Saying, Behold, right valiantly,
The Lords right hand has brought to pas.

Exalted is now presently,
Of God the Lord the right hand sturdie,
Has done (say they) triumphantly.

For yet deaths cup I shall not prove:
But shall still live, that I may expone,
And show abroad GODS works above.

And that right sore, I must confess:
But, of his goodness, not delivered
Me unto death, in that distress.

Which are the gates of righteousness,
That through the same I may have repair,
And praise the LORD his holiness.

Whereat the righteous enter shall:

And my deliverance been withal.

And of the builders cast away:
The same laid is now, and placed,
As of the corner chief head and stay.

Of GOD the LORD most glorious,
And as a wonder is appearing,
Unto our sight most marvelous.

Which GOD has made of his goodness:
Let us therein be blythe and merry,
And sing to GOD with great gladness.

Save thou the king, and him maintain:
Give him good luck, and prosperous to be,
O LORD, I yet require again.

Does come, he blessed be always:
We wish also ye may be happy,
Who in Gods house are night and day.

And has us given light at last:
Unto the horns of The Altar holy,
Your sacrifice now bind full fast.

To thee will I give praise therefore:
Even thou my God art, therefore will I,
Laud and exalt thee evermore.

For gracious is he and kind:
Yea, more, his mercy and great favor,
Does ay endure world without end.

for truth is quite decayed.
Thy law likewise they have transgrest,
and none against them said.

thy Laws better then gold:
Or jewels fine, which are esteemde,
most costly to be sold.

and so them laid in store:
All crafty and malicious ways,
I do abhor therefore.

and full of things profound:
My soul therefore does keep them sure,
when they are tried and found.

they find a light most clear:
And very idiotes understand,
when they it read or hear.

to know thy Commandment:
That I might guide my life thereby,
I sought what thing it meant.

behold me from above:
As thou art wont to behold such,
as thy Name fear and love.

that I thy will may know:
And never let iniquity,
thy servant ouer-throw.

preserve and keep me sure:
Thy precepts then will I observe,
and put them eke in ure.

Let shine on me, and by thy Law,
teach me what to eschew.

When I behold how wicked men,
thy Law keep never a deal.

the wicked though they grudge,
And when thou do sentence pronounce,
thou art a righteous judge.

are two chief points, and hie:
And such as thou have in thy Law,
commanded us straitely.

and even pyned away:
To see my foes thy words forget,
for ought that I do may.

as any heart can deem:
And I thy servant nothing more,
do love or yet esteem.

as one of base degree:
Yet do I not thine Hestes forget,
nor shrink away from thee.

for ever to endure:
Also thy Law is truth it self,
most constant and most pure.

and brought me wondrous low:
Yet do I still of thy Precepts,
delight to hear and know.

do last for evermore:
Then teach them me, for even in them,
my life lies up in store.
KOPH.

now answer me, O LORD:
That thy Commandementes to observe,
I may fully accord.

with most humble request:
Save me, therefore, and I will keep,
thy Precepts and thine Hest.

before the day wax light:
Because that I have in thy word,
my confidence whole plight.

and ere the day I wake:
That by devising of thy word,
I might some comfort take.

and pity on me take:
As thou wast wont, so judge me, Lord,
lest life me should forsake.

my death maliciously:
Which from thy Law are far gone back,
and straide from it lewdly.

for need does so require:
And all thy Precepts true they are,
then help, I thee desire.

not now, but long ago:
That they remain for evermore,
thou have them grounded so.
RESH.

consider and behold:
Deliver me, for of thy Law,
I ever take fast hold.

with speed me succor send,
From death, as thou have promised,
Lord, keep me and defend.

from having health and grace,
Whereby they might thy statutes know,
they enter not the trace.

what tongue can them attain?
And as thou have me judgde ere now,
so let me life obtain.

and persecute most sore,
Yet from thy Laws I never shrunk,
nor went awry therefore.

when I these traitors see,
Because they keep no whit thy word,
nor yet seek to know thee.

with heart most glad and feign,
As thou art good and gracious, Lord,
restore my life again.

and so it has been ever,
Thy righteous judgementes are also,
most true, and decay never.
SCHIN.

causeless to make me crouch:
But all in vain, for of thy word,
the fear did mine heart touch.

I was more merry and glad,
Then he that of rich spoils and preyes,
great store and plenty had.

I hate most and detest,
For why? thine holy Law do I,
above all things love best.

singing with heart and voice,
Thy righteous acts and wonderful,
so cause me to rejoice.

who do thy statutes love,
No danger shall their quiet state,
impair, or once remove.

I look for, at thine hand:
And therefore have I done these things,
which thou did me command.

which my soul most desirde:
So much my love to them was bent,
that naught else I requirde.

I kept, thou know, aright:
For all the things that I have done,
are present in thy sight.
TAV.

before thy face appear:
And as thou have me promised,
so teach me thee to fear.

to thee let find access:
And grant me, Lord, deliverance,
for so is thy promise.

after most ample sort:
When thou thy statutes have me taught,
wherein stands my comfort.

and on this wise say shall:
GODS famous acts and noble Laws,
are just and perfect all.

and speedily me save:
For thy Commandementes to observe,
chosen, O LORD, I have.

for other know I none:
And in thy Law, and nothing else,
I do delight alone.

thy NAME to magnify:
And of thy judgementes merciful,
let me thy favor try.

much like a wandering sheep:
Oh, seek me, for I have not failde,
thy Commandementes to keep.
PSALM CXX.
^IN trouble and in thrall, Unto the LORD I call, And he does me comfort:


Gets thou, thus for to sting,
Thou false and flattering liar?

No less then arrows keen,
Of hot consuming fire.

Within these tents so black,
Which Kedars are by name:
By whom the folk elect,
And all of Isaaks sect,
Are put to open shame.

I came a peace to make,
And set a quiet life:

Causeless I was controlde,
By them that would have strife.
PSALM CXXI.
^I Lift mine eyes to Sion hill, From whence I do attend, That succor GOD me
send:


And will thee safely keep:
For he will never sleep.

No sleep at all can him catch,
But his eyes shall ever watch.

The LORD eke does thee cover,
As at thy right hand ever.

Nor the Moon, nor half so bright,
Shall with cold thee hurt by night.

And will thy life sure save:
And thou shall also have,

Where ever thou go in or out,
GOD will thy things bring about.
PSALM CXXII.
^I Did in heart rejoice, To hear the peoples voice, In offering so willingly:
For let us up, say they, And in the LORDS house pray: Thus spoke the folk full
lovingly.


The Tribes of GOD the LORD,
Are thither bent their way to take,
So GOD before did tell,
That there his Israel,
Their prayers should together make:

And that for this respect,
To set forth justice orderly:
Which thrones right to maintain,
To David's house pertain,
His folk to judge accordingly.

For Ierusalems peace,
Thy friends GOD prosper mightily,

And prosper thee throughout,
Thy Palaces continually.

For my poor brethrens sake:
That comfort have by means of thee,

Thy wealth for to procure,
So much always as lies in me.
PSALM CXXIII.
^O LORD, that heaven do possess, I lift mine eyes to thee, Even as the
servant lifts his, his masters hands to see.


and mercy in thy fight,
For we be filde and overcome,
with hatred and despite.

the rich and worldly wise,
Do make of us their mocking stock,
the proud do us despise.
PSALM CXXIV.
^NOw Israel may say, and that truly, If that the LORD had not our cause
maintainde:


they had deuourde us all,
And swallowde quick,
for ought that we could deem:
Such was their rage,
as we might well esteem,

with mighty force do fall,
So had they now,
our life even brought to thrall.

Had long ago,
ouer-whelmde us in the deep,

which does us safely keep,
From bloody teeth,
and their most cruel voice,
Which as a prey,

Escapes away,
right so it far'th with us,
Broke are their nets,
and we have escaped thus,

and earth, is our help then,
His NAME has sau'de
us from those wicked men.
PSALM CXXV.
^SVch as in GOD the LORD do trust, As Mount-Sion shall firmly stand, And be
removed at no hand, The LORD will count them right and just, ^So that they
shall be sure: For ever to endure.


Jerusalem about do close,
So will the LORD be unto those,
Who on his Godly will do wait:
Such are to him so dear,
They never need to fear.

By making wicked men his rod:
Lest they, through grief forsake their God,
It shall not as their lot still be.

Whose hearts are true and right.

By crooked ways, which they out-sought,
The LORD will surely bring to naught,
With workers vile they shall abide,
But peace with Israel,
For evermore shall dwell.
PSALM CXXVI.
^WHen that the LORD, again his Sion had foorth-brought, From bondage great,
and also servitude extreme, His work was such as did surmount man's heart and
thought, So that we were much like to them that use to dream: Our mouths
were with laughter filled then, And eke our tongues did show us joyful men.


were forced then this to confess,
How that the LORD,
for them also great things had done,

and therefore can confess no less,
Wherefore to joy,
we have good cause, as we begun.

thou can our bondage end:
As to deserts,
thy flowing rivers send.

that they which sow with tears indeed,
A time will come,
when they shall reap with mirth and joy.

in bearing of their precious seed,
For that their foes,
full often times did them annoy,
But their return,
with joy they shall sure see,
Their sheaues home bring,
and not impeded be.
PSALM CXXVII.
^EXcept the LORD the house do make, And thereunto do set his hand: What men
do build, it cannot stand. Likewise in vain men undertake, Cities and
holds to watch and ward, Except the LORD be their safe-gard.


And so at night go late to bed,
Feeding full hardly with brown bread,
Yet were your labor lost and worn,
But they whom God does love and keep,
Receive all things with quiet sleep.

That men have heirs t'enioy their land,
It is the gift of GODS own hand,
For GOD himself does multiply,
Of his great liberality,
The blessing of posterity.

They grow in strength and actiuenesse,
In person and in comeliness,
So that a shaft shot with courage,
Of one that has a most strong arm,
Flies not so swift, nor does like harm.

Furnished with such artilerie:
For when in peril be shall be,
Such one shall never shake nor shiuer,
When that he pleades before the Judge,
Against his foes, which bear him grudge.
PSALM CXXVIII.
^BLessed art thou, that fear GOD, and walk in his way:


and he shall let thee see:
The promised Jerusalem,
and his felicity.

to thy great joys, increase:
And likewise grace on Israel,
prosperity and peace.
PSALM CXXIX.
^OF Israel this may now be the song,


the mark in bone and skin,
That one would think,
the plow-men with their plowes,
Upon my back,
have made their balkes far in,
For like plowde ground,
even so have I long furrows.

Has cut the ropes,
and so staide the wickeds rage.

Which hate Sion,
or wish it any damage.

Upon the walls,
or tops of houses most hie,
Which suddenly,
ere one beware, withreth,
So that no fruit,
on such herbs can gathred be.

Such grass as that,
or thereof his hand did fill:
Much less that he,
who glainth of that is sowde,
Under his arm,

that passes by that way,
Says to the reapers,
GOD save you, or GOD speed,
No man does,

Or pray, that GOD,

PSALM CXXX.
^LORD, to thee I make my moan, When dangers me oppress, I call, I sigh,
plain, and groan, ^Trusting to find release.


Our sins, and them peruse:
Who shall then escape, and say,
I can my self excuse?

And turnst to us thy grace:
That we with hearts most careful,
Should fear before thy face.

My soul waits on his will:
For his promise is most just,
And I hope therein still.

Wishing for him always:
More then they that watch and ward,
To see the dawning day.

In the LORD put his trust:
He is that GOD of mercy,
That his deliver must.

And all such as surely have,
Their confidence in him.

I have no scornful eye:
I do not exercise my self,
in things that are too hie.

So have I, LORD, behau'de my self,
in silence and in rest.

let him be all thy stay:
From this time forth, and evermore,
from age to age, I say.
PSALM CXXXII.
Sing this as the 36. Psalm.
OF David, LORD, in mind record,
And eke of his afflictions all:

And made a solemn vow withal,
Saying to Iaakobs mighty GOD:

Mine house not enter in will I:

Nor once give sleep unto mine eye,
Or yet mine eyelids close from wake:

And find some place his own to be,
Where Iaakobs mighty GOD may bide,
And plant his house eternally,
There to remain from time to tide.

In Ephrata that fruitful ground:
Which is right pleasant unto thee,
And have thy dwelling place out found,
Within the Forest fields to be.

To worship thee, we will be pressed:
Before thy footstool there in fight.

Thou, and the Arc of thy great might.

A precious garment it them make:
Give to thine holy One solace,

Refuse not thine Anointeds face.

And sure he will perform that thing:
Saying, Doubtless I will vpreare,
The fruit that from thy loins shall spring,
Upon thy throne the rule to bear.

And from my Laws abacke not flit,
Which I them learn, this grace again,
Will I them show, their sons shall sit,
Upon thy seat, ay to remain.

Where to abide he likes well:

For evermore I here will dwell,
My whole delight is set thereon.

Her poor with bread eke satisfy,

Yea, all her good men cause will I,
To shout and cry for joyfullnesse.

In her will I make budde and spring:
For I ordained have a light,
To mine Anointed CHRIST and King,
There to remain in all men's sight.

With vile reproach, rebuke, and shame:
Whereas his Crown imperial,
Unto his honor and great fame,
Upon his head still flourish shall.
PSALM CXXXIII.
^O How happy a thing it is, and joyful for to see, Brethren together fast to

And finally it did run down,

sing, To GOD of gods, I say: For certainly, His mercies dure, Both firm and
sure, Eternally.


Whose mercies ay do dure:

Does work by his great power:
For certainly,
His mercies dure,
Both firm and sure,
Eternally.

By his great wisdom hie,
The heavenly firmament,
Did frame, as we may see:
For certainly,
His mercies dure,
Both firm and sure,
Eternally.

And on the waters large,
The same he did out-reach:
For certainly,
His mercies, etc.

For why? his love is ay:

To rule the lightsome day:
For certainly,
His mercies, etc.

Which shines in our sight,
And stars that do appear,
To guide the darkesome night:
For certainly,
His mercies, etc.

All Egypt smote he then:
Their firstborn less and more,
He slew of beast and man:
For certainly,
His mercies, etc.

His Israel forth brought:

And stretched arm has wrought:

Which stood up like a wall,

Now let us hear your Hebrew songs,

Then let my fingers quite forget,

They cryde, On sack, and raze their walls,

has most advanced, Which does excel, and ought to be inhanced.

And strengthened have,
my soul so sore oppressed.

shall thee, LORD, praise with fear,
For they have heard,
thy word by mouth expressed.

and praise thy ways so holy,
For great thou art,
and great, LORD, is thy glory.

As for the proud,
far off he him observes.

And with the same,
thou art my sure defender.

Will it perform,

Forsake not, LORD,
thy work, which thou have framed:
But let me be,
by thee always reclaimed.
PSALM CXXXIX.
Sing this as the 137. Psalm.
O LORD, thou have me tried and known,
my sitting do thou know:

thou vnderstandst also.

thou compassest always,
And by familiar custom art,
acquainted with my ways.

but known it is to thee:

and layest thine hand on me.

LORD is thy cunning skill:
It is so hie, that I the same,
cannot attain until.

LORD, whither shall I go?
Or whither shall I flee away,
thy presence to escape fro?

lo, thou art present there:
In hell if I lie down below,
even there thou do appear.

and let me go and hide,
Even there where are the farthest parts,
where flowing sea does slide:

thy reaching-hand me guide:
And thy right hand shall hold me fast,
and make me to abide.

yet shroude me from thy sight.
Lo, even also the darkest night,
about me shall be light.

but night does shine as day:
To thee the darkness and the night,
are both alike always.

and thou have covered me,
When I within my mothers womb,
enclosed was by thee.

and wondrous made I am:
Thy works are marvelous, and well
my soul does know the same.

I have been made, and in the earth,

Were written all, naught was before

And of them all, how passing great,

And whenever I awake,
yet still am I with thee.

oh, that thou would slay,
Even those, O GOD, to whom I cry,
depart from me away.

These that are lifted up in vain,

PSALM CXL.

cruell-mans despite, preserved let me be:

Free from the cruel man, that would

PSALM CXLII.
^VNto the LORD I cry did and call: Yea, with my voice I him besought:


Yet thou my path did know always:
The self same trade wherein I then went,
My foes so much to malice were bent,
They privily their snares did lay,
to take me as their prey.

And so beheld on either side,
Not one found I, which cold me well brook,
But seeming strange they there me forsook,
All refuge was from me full wide,
my soul the self same tried.

And also said thus in effect:
Thou art mine hope, and so still shall be,
Yea, my whole part, which thou gave me,
Within that land so seemly dect,
where dwell do thine elect.

For I am brought full low and base,
Save me from such, as put me in fear,
Which tyrants would asunder me tear:
For why? their force might soon take place,
me thoroughly to deface.

That I may praise thine holy NAME:
The righteous then will still stand me by:
And with much joy, thy praises forth cry:
For showing, LORD, to me the same,
they will set forth thy fame.
PSALM CXLIII.
^OH, hear my prayer, LORD, And unto my request: To bow thine care accord: And
as thou think best, According to thy truth, And for thy justice sake, O
LORD, on me have rueth, And answer to me make.


With me, thy servant poor:
For why? this well I wot,
No man in sight may dure.
Of thee the living GOD,
If thou his deeds would try,
He dare make none abode,
Himself to justify.

Pursued has with spite,
My soul it to destroy:
Yea, he my life, down right
Unto the earth had smote,
And laid me full low,
In darkness, as forgot,
Or men dead long ago.

Was troubled with unrest:
Mine heart amazed was,
And vexed in my breast.

Time past, and do record,
Thy works: yea, think on all
Thine handie-workes, O LORD.

Mine hands I stretch abroad:
To thee, mine help alone.
For lo, my soul, O GOD,
Most ardently desires,
And longs after thee,
As thirsty ground requires,
With rain refresht to be.

To hear me make good speed:
For lo, my spirit does fail,
Hide not thy face in need,
From me, poor wretch, alas,
For doubtless else I shall,
Be like to them that pass,
And in the grave do fall.

Thy clemency benign,
To hear grant unto me,
When break of day does spring.
The way to me descrie,
That I should walk and go:
For I my soul on hie,
To thee have lifted tho.

And set me free, I pray:
For, LORD, with thee I have,
Still hid my self always.

Me, LORD, my GOD of might,
Let thy good Spirit conduct
Me to the land of right.

For thy NAMES sake also,
And for thy justice, LORD,
Bring out my soul from woe.

My foes, and put to shame
My souls oppressors aye,
For I thy servant am.

thy heavens, and descend.

And scatter them: thine arrows shoot,

O LORD, deliver me,
Take me from waters great, from hand
of strangers make me free:

And their right hand is a right hand,

On viole and on instrument,

And their right hand is a right hand,
of guile and subtlety.

whom growing youth does rear:
Our daughters carved corner stones,
like to a palace fair.

with sundry sorts be found:
Our sheep bring thousands in our streets,
ten thousands may abound.

that none do us invade,
There be no going out, nor cry

such blessings are so storde,
Yea, blessed all the people are,
whose GOD is GOD the LORD
PSALM CXLV.
^O LORD, that art my GOD ^and King, Undoubtedly I will thee praise, I will
extol and blessings sing, Unto thine holy NAME always:


And so declare thy power, O LORD,

And wondrous works will I record.

Of all thy fearful acts declare,
And I to publish all abroad,
Thy greatness at no time will spare.

And specify thy great goodness,
And with loud voice their songs each one,
Shall frame to show thy righteousness.

Yea, merciful is he also,
In mercy he is plenteous,
But unto wrath and anger slow.

Whose mercies all his works exceed,

And eke thy Saints thee bless indeed.

Do show, and of thy power do tell,

And Kingdom great, that does excel.

Thy Lordship ever does remain:

And does the feeble folk sustain.

And on thee wait, that here do live,
And thou in season due do send,
Sufficient food them to relieve.

And every thing do satisfy,
That live, and on this earth abide,
Of thy great liberality.

And holy in his works each one,

In truth that call to him alone.

Of such as do him fear and dread,
And he also their cry hear will,
And save them in the time of need.

That bear to him a loving heart,
But workers all of wickedness,
Destroy will he and clean subvert.

To speak the praises of the Lord,
All flesh to bless his holy NAME,
For evermore eke shall accord.
PSALM CXLVI.
^MY soul praise thou the LORD always, my GOD I will confess,


to earth anon they fall.
And then the counsels of their heart,
decay and perish all.

whom Iaakobs God does aid,
And he whose hope does not decay,
but on the Lord is staide:

the heavens hie withal,
Who does his word and promise keep,
in truth, and ever shall.

for such as suffer wrong,
The poor and hungry he does feed,
and loose the fetters strong.

the lame to limbs restore,
The Lord, I say, does love the right,
and just man evermore.

the strangers sad in heart,
And quite the widow from distress, and ill men's ways subvert.

O Sion, still shall reign,
In time of all posterity,
for ever to remain.
PSALM CXLVII.
^PRaise ye the LORD, for it is good, unto our GOD to sing: For it is
pleasant, and to praise, it is a comely thing.


their sore up does he bind:

and nam'th them in their kind.

his wisdom infinite:

to ground the wicked wight.

unto the Lord rejoice:
And to our God upon the harp,
advance your singing voice.

the earth prepares rain,
And on the mountains he does make,
the grass to grow again.

young ravens when they cry:

no pleasure takes he.

the Lord has his delight:
And such as do attend upon,
his mercies shining light.

thy GOD, O Sion, praise:

wherewith thy gates he stays.

and in thy borders he
Does settle peace, and with the flower
of wheat he fills thee.

the earth he sends out,
And eke his word with speedy course,
does swiftly run about.

like ashes does he spread:

the cold who can abide?

and melts them again:
His wind he makes blow, and then
the waters flow amain.

to Iaakob does he show:
His statutes and his judgementes he
gives Israel to know.

so dealt nor have they known,
His secret judgementes, now therefore,
praise ye the LORD alone.
PSALM CXLVIII.
Sing this as the 136. Psalm.
Give laud unto the LORD,
From heaven, that is so hie:
Praise him in deed and word,
Above the starrie Sky.

His Angels all,
Armies royal,
Praise him with glee.

Which are so clear and bright:
The same of you be done,
Ye glistring stars of light.

Ye heavens fair,
And clouds of the air,
His laud express.

All formed, as we see:
At his voice did appear,
All things in their degree:

To them he made,
A law and trade,
for aye to last.

In earth ye Dragons fell,
All depthes do ye the sa^e,
For it becomes you well.

Fire, hail, ye, snow,
And storms that blow,
At his decree.

And trees that fruitful are,
The Cedars great and tall,
His worthy praise declare.

Yea, birds flying,
And worms creeping,
That on earth dwell.

With all their pompous train,
Princes and all judges,
That in the world remain.

Young men and maids,
Old men and babes,
Do ye the same.

To be most excellent,
Whose praise is far above,
The earth and firmament:
For sure he shall,
Exalt with bliss,
The horn of his,
And help them all.
His Saints all shall forth tell,
His praise and worthiness,
The children of Israel,
Each one, both more and less.
And also they,
That with good will,
His words fulfill.
And him obey.
PSALM CXLIX.
^SIng unto the LORD, with hearty accord, A new joyful song, His praises
resound, In every ground, His Saints all among.


And praise eke with voice,
His maker loving,
The sons of Sion,
Let them every one,
Be glad in their King.

His NAME in the dance,
Both now and always,
With harp and ^abret,
Even so likewise let
Them utter his praise.

In them that are his,
Not willing to start:
But all means do seek,
To succor the meek,
And humble in heart.

His praise shall express,
As is good and right:
Rejoicing, I say,
Both now and for aye,
In their beds at night.

In every rout,
In praise of their Lord,
And as men most bold,
In hand shall they hold
A two edged sword:

In every degree,
The hearthen upon,
And for to reprove,
As them does behoue,
The people each one.

In chains that will last,
Their nobles also,
In hard iron bands,
As Well feet as hands,
To their grief and woe.

Give sentence with speed,
On them to their pain.
Which is writ always,
such honor and praise,
His Saints shall obtain.
PSALM CL.
^YEeld unto GOD, the mighty LORD, praise in his Sanctuary: And praise him in
the firmament, that shew'th his power on hie.


of sounding trumpets blow:
Praise him upon the viole, and
upon the harp also.

organes, and virginalles:

praise him with loud cymballes.

of breathing, praise the LORD:
To praise the NAME of GOD the LORD,
agree with one accord.
