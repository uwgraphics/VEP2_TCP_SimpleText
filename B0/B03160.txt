AN ELEGY ON That Illustrious and Highborn PRINCE RUPERT, Who Dyed on
Wednesday November the 29th.
1. Dec. 1682
FArewell, thou Bravest of the Great, Farewell,
When Fame shall thy Unbiast Virtues tell;
Thy Match no History shall ever find,
Thou Universal Favorite of Mankind;
Whilst Factions Boil, whilst Bandying Parties clash,
And meeting Tides their angry Billows dash,
Whilst Heat meets Heat, and thwarting Ferments Reign,
Rupert alone, firm to Truths Golden mean
Held his, even Souls miraculous Balance right,
The Countries Darling, yet the Courts delight;
Honor in Thee, united all Her Charms,
In glories Race, in Battle and in Arms;
No fiercer Fires e're filled a Heroes Breast,
In Peace thy mind a perfect Halcyon Nest,
Where Manly Virtue kept Her Princely Throne,
Yet so retired as if Her State were gone:
A mind so firm, all irregular Heat,
The restless Burning Feavour of the Great;
A mind where all Perfections mixed so well,
The equal Glory of a Camp or Cell.
When future Ages shall with Honor tell
Things Dismal, that black Master-peice of Hell,
The Royal Martyrs Wound, a Blow so great,
Posterity shall start but to repeat:
In the sad Tale, Great Ruperts Deeds shall come,
And blossom on his Sacred Masters Tomb.
No hand more Active, and no sharper Sword,
The Throats of Englands Rebel Hydra gored;
And if in that lost day, when Fates dire Blow,
Had destined Truth and Loyalties overthrow;
Inth' Universal wrack, Great Rupert sunk,
Whilst starting Fortune from his Bannors shrunk;
His Courage only swelled his Sails too High,
Till his great Soul onset his Victory:
Our English Hannibal, like him, alone
By his unmannaged Conquests overthrown.
Whilst that mad Chandteer, with fury hurled,
Ambition drives the Jehues of the World;
Whilst Ensigns fly, Drums beat, and Trumpets sound,
Or Conquering Heroes are with Lawrells Crowned,
Fames deathless Book shall keep in Leaves of Brass,
Proud Ruperts Name enroul'd till Times last Glass:
Nor is thy Memory here only Crowned,
But lives in Arts, as well as Arms renowned;
Thou Prideless Thunderer, that stooped so low,
To force the very Bolts thy Arm should throw,
Whilst the same Eyes Great Rupert did admire
Shining in Fields, and sooty at the Fire:
Perceiving thee advanced in Fields and Arms so far
At once the Mars and Vulcan of the War,
Till Dancing Cyclops shall thy praise repeat,
And on their Anvils thy tuned Glorys Beat.
Written by a Person of Quallity.
