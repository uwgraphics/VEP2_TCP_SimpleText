Fie on the WARS that hurried WILLIE from me.
An excellent New Song, Much in request.
FIE on the Wars that hurried Willie from me,
Who to love me just had Sworn,
They made him Captive sure to undo me;
Wo's me he will never return.
A Thousand Lowns abroad will fight him;
He from Thousands never will run:
Day and Night I did entreat him
To stay safe from Sword and Gun,
I used alluring Graces
With meikle fond Embraces
Now Sighing: then Crying. Tears droping fall,
But had he my soft Arms.
Preferred to Wars Alarms:
My Soul grows Mad,
Its sore oppressed and sad,
I fear in my Fir, I had granted all.
I washed and painted, to make me look provoking
Snares that told me would catch the Man:
And on my Head high Commodes had cocking,
Which made me look as tall again
For a new gown I paid much Money,
Which with Gold Flowers abroad did shine:
My love well might think me Gay and Bonny,
No Scots Lass was ever so fine:
My Petticoat was spotted,
Earings too, with Froinges knotted,
Laced Shoes, silk Hoes garten'd over the Knee
But oh the fatal thought,
To Willie these were naught,
But I Will ride to the Town
And riffle with dragoon
And the silly Lows might have plundered me:
FINIS.
