The Unfortunate Lover: OR, Merry ANDREW's sad and woeful Lamentation for the
Loss of his Sweetheart JOAN.
To the Tune of, I marry and thank ye too.
Licensed according to Order.





ALas I am come to Town,
and here make pitiful moan,
For having rambled up and down
cannot find out my true Love Joan.
I came to Bartholomew Fair,
and searched that Place alone,
Expecting to have found her there,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
I am in a pitiful Case,
and shall be overthrown,
I have made many a sour Face,
for want of my true Love Joan.
In Bed I can take no rest,
but rumble and toss alone,
A thousand Torments in my Breast
for want of my Sweetheart Joan.


To Love I am so inclined
and daily do make sad moan,
And quite distracted in my mind,
for want of my true Love Joan.
She Is as sweet as a sucking Pig,
for her I do make my moan;
I long to Dance the VVedding-Iig
along with my Sweetheart Joan.
I wander the silent Grove,
and make most piteous moan,
I am over head and ears in Love,
and all for my Sweetheart Joan.
For she was as sweet a hit,
as ever by me was known,
Her precious Smiles I cannot forget,
Oh, where is my Sweetheart Joan.
Her Lips they were Cherry red,
she had but one fault alone,
A little Child ever she was Wed,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
I like her never the worse,
the Child's a Champion grown,
By being well brought up at Nurse,
But where is my Sweetheart Joan.
To speak of her Beauty bright,
there hardly is such a One,
Her pleasant Charms does dim my sight,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
At once she looks North and South,
her Beauty I needs must own,
She has a pretty Sparrows Mouth,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
Her pretty sweet Bettle-brow,
but Teeth she has not one,
She is as slender as a Cow,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
Her Hair's as black as a Cole,
for her I do make sad moan,
I fear some Lord or Earl has store,
my delicate Sweetheart Joan.
