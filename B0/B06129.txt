To the KINGS most Sacred Majesty:
The most Faithful and Unfeigned Thanks and Resolves of the Mayor, Sheriffs,
Aldermen, Citizens, and Commonality of the City of Norwich, in Common Council
Assembled, at their General Quarter Assembly, held the 3d. of May, in the 33d.
year of Your Majesty's Reign, and Sealed with their Common Seal.
FIrst, we Restore Your Majesty, our Hearty Thanks for Your Majesty's steady
Resolution of maintaining the Rights of the Crown, and Succession in their due
Course, and our Religion, by Law Established, the Right of Your Subjects, their
Liberties and Properties, against the Arbitrary proceedings of the House of
commons, in their two last Parliaments, and their Unlimited, and Illegal
Imprisonments; and their Messengers exorbitant, exacting pretended Fees form
Your Loyal Subjects, contrary to Magna Carta, and Your Majesty's Declaration,
dated the eight day of April, 1681.

We also Unanimously thank Your Sacred Majesty, for giving Your last
Parliaments such timely Dissolutions, and for Your Gracious and kind
Declaration sent after them, and not passing limitations, or nullifications of
such wholesome Acts, as were designed for a preservation of the Reformed
Religion, especially the 35th. of Queen Elizabeth, as well as for not signing
such others, which were prepared for Your Majesty's Subjects, to associate and
destroy the Succession, and extirpate Monarchy, not doubting, but by Your
Majesty's great Wisdom, effectual Care will be taken, that those Laws, now in
force, may vigorously, speedily, and equally be put in execution, against all
Papists and Protestant Dissenters, whereby we hope in time, they will be all
brought to their right Understanding, Obedience, and Allegiance to Your Majesty.

And we do Unanimously resolve, that it shall be our utmost endeavors, when
Your Majesty's occasions require, to send such men for our Representatives, as
shall readily, and willingly supply Your Majesty's occasions, and the Defense
of the Kingdom by Sea and Land, and give discouragements to all Papists, and
other malicious opposers, being clearly Convinced, that the Conveening of
Parliaments to any place, Managing, Proroguing, and Dissolving the same, is the
unquestionable Right of Your Majesty.

We farther Resolve, that to our utmost power we will, as in duty bound, stand
by, and defend with our Lives and Fortunes, Your Majesty's Sacred Person and
Government, as by Law Established, and the Succession in the right Line, and
legal course of descent, against all vile Attempts of all that do yet retain
their old Commonwealth Principles, by whom Your Father of Ever-blessed Memory,
was Barbarously Murdered, and shall always, upon all occasions, be in greatest
readiness to perform the same, and glad to show our selves,

Great Sir, Your Sacred Majesty's most Faithful, Dutiful, Obedient, Loyal, and
true hearted Citizens and Subjects.

Reprinted in the Year, 1681.
