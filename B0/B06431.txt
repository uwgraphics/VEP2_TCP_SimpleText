GAllants come list a while
a story I shall tell,
Of a Commander bold,
and what to him befell,
He was besieged round,
in Chester City fair.
His Lady being with him,
which filled his heart with care,
This unto her he said
dearest come thou to me,
I would give ten thousand pound
thou were in Shrewsbury.
O my own hearts delight,
my joy and Turtle Dove,
More dear then mine own life,
heavens know I do thee love,
Those beauteous looks of thine,
my senses set on fire,
Yea though I love thee well,
thy absence I desire.
Dearest come thou to me, etc.
Thy fair red colored cheeks,
and thy bright shining eye,
Makes me always inflamed
with thy sweet company.
Thy breath smells far more sweet,
then does sweet frankincense
And yet for all those fames
I wish thee farther hence.
This makes me sing and say, etc.
Look how my Uncle stands
I dare not come him near,
Because I love the King
and am a Cavalear,
Yet for my Lady and her son,
my heart does bleed for thee,
I would give ten thousand pound
they were in Shrewsbury.
They were in Shrewsbury,
some comfort for to find,
Amongst the Cavaleers
to ease a troubled mind.
My heart bleeds in my breast,
for my fair Ladies sake,
And how to save her life,
I know no course to take
Mark how the drums do beat
and warlike Trumpets sound,
See how the Musketeers
have now begirt us round.
They Souldies they cry out,
kill, kill, no quarter give,
What hopes then can I have;
that my true love should live.

WHen he thus spoken had,
his Lady be forlook,
And with a manly heart
his sword in hand he took,
Farewell my Lady dear,
now will I bandie blows,
And fight my self to death,
amongst my desprate foes,
Dearest farewell from me,
dearest farewell from me,
I would give ten thousand pound,
thou were in Shrewsbury.
His Lady seeing then,
the danger they were in,
She like a Soldier bold,
nobly then did begin
My trusty love quoth she
since thou so valiant art
What are becomes of me,
stoutly I Will take thy part.
Dearest cast care away,
let kisses comfort thee,
Thou and I Will nere depart,
I Will live and die with thee.
Put me on man's attire,
give me a soldiers Coat,
I Will make King Charles his foes,
quickly to change their note.
Cock your match prime pour pan,
let piercing bullets fly,
I do not care a Pin
whether I live or die.
Dearest cast care away,
let kisses comfort thee,
Thou and I Will never depart,
I Will live and die with thee.
She took a Musket then,
and a sword by her side,
In disguise like a man,
her valor so she tried.
And with her True-love she
march forth courageously,
And made away with speed
quite throught the Enemy.
Dearest cast care away,
let kisses comfort thee,
Thou and I Will never depart,
I Will live and die with thee.
Their Soldiers brave and bold,
behaved themselves so well,
That all the Northern parts
of their deserts can tell
Thus have you heard the news
of a most valiant wight,
And of his Lady brave,
how stoutly they did fight,
Dearest cast care away,
let kisses comfort thee,
Thou and I Will never depart,
I Will live and die with thee.
