Labor in vain. OR An imperfect description of Love.
Imperfect I well call it may,
For who can all Loves parts display?
To a dainty new tune, called Ienkinson.


FIe upon love, fond love,
false love,
Great are the torments
that Lovers endure:
It is a snare, brings care,
bones bare,
None can a remedy
for it procure:
Of all the afflictions
that are incident
To us while we march
under Times regiment,
There Is nothing to man
brings so much discontent
as love vnbeloued again.
It breaks our sleep,
it distracteth the wit,
It makes us do things
that for men are unfit:
If I may but give
It a true censure on it,
shall be called Labor in vain.
Love is a fire, hot fire,
fierce fire,
Who can abide
the extremity on it!
It burns the reins, great pains,
small gains
Shall a man get
after beauty to hunt:
It Is that which the learned
by right do name
(As I do conjecture)
the Idalean flame,
Jove grant that I never
do feel the same.
so near as I can I Will refrain:
Yet if the blind rascal
at me shall shoot,
I know to withstand him
it were no boot,
Both young men and maidens
with you look to it,
For this is right Labor in vain.
Love is a well, deep well,
steep well,
No man can sound
its profundity right:
The water in it, melts ^int
sets stint
Both to the Pesant,
the Lord, and the Knight:
It is Aganipe,
or Helicon,
It gives him invention
that erst had none:
It yields enough matter
to work upon
For every illiterate swain:
It Is like to that water
where Tantalus stood,
A man may be starved
among plenty of food,
I had rather taste of
the cool running flood,
Then drink at this Labor in vain.
The second part,
To the same tune.


Love is a hill, high hill,
great hill,
No man ere climbed
to the top of the same:
He that aspires, it tyres,
with briars
It is environed
wild men to tame.
It Is that against which
poor Sisiphus strives
To roll up a stone,
which downward drives,
This restless foil
costs many men's lives,
and few by the journey do gain:
The paths are so difficult
to find out,
The best Cosmographer
his skill may doubt,
Twill daunt him if he
thinks himself most stout,
And this is right Labor in vain.
Love is a chain, strong chain,
long chain,
He who is bound in it
seldom gets free,
Twill hold him fast, till th'last,
houre's past,
Though strong as Hector,
or Ajax he be,
It Is that wherewith lusty
Aleides bound
The three headed Cerberus,
that hell-hound,
When he did Don Plutoes
power confound,
and got Proserpina again.
It Is that where with Sampson,
by the Philistims was
Bound to the mill
where he ground like an ass:
It Is stronger then iron,
steel, or brass,
And this is called Labor in vain.
Love is a wheel, round wheel,
swift wheel,
Which when it is turning
none's able to stop:
In circle wise, it flies,
and hyes
Swiftly to bring
what was lowest to the top:
It Is that which unfortunate
Ixion turns,
While at his nere ending
labor he mournes,
The axletree of it
perpetually burns,
because it no liquor can gain:
In brief, Love is any thing
that is without rest,
A passion that boileth
and scaldeth the breast,
Yet he who loves loved again
(so all this jest)
Dwelsr not at the Labor in vain.
