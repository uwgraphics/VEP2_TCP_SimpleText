heirof in ane Trance.

Imprentit at Edinburgh be Robert Lekpreuik. An. Do. 1570.

IN Ianuar the three and twenty day,
Befoir midnycht, in Lythquo as I lay,
Tumbling sum time on bed abon the clais,
Now heir, now their, quhylis down, quhylis up I raise.
Till at the last, in trunkling of ane Ee,
Schir Morpheus the Mair assailzeit me:
With all his sluggische Suldarts out of number
Quhilks led me Captive, unto Master slumber.
Quha softly said, gar keip this pure Catiue,
And tak from him, his speiche, and wittis five.
Than come Dame Dreming, all cled in blak Sabill
With Sweyning Nymphis, in cullouris variabill
Amangis the quhilks, befoir me their appeiris,
Ane woundit man, of ancht and thretrie eiris:
Paill of the face, both blaiknit blude and ble,
Deid eyit, dram like, disfigurat was he.
Nakit and bair, schot throw pudding and panche,
Abone the Nauill, and out above the hanche.
Na word he said, quhairthrow I did misknaw him
Because in sic ane stait I never saw him,
I was aghast, and sa begouth to feir,
Bot suddanly with him their did appeir:
Two graif like persounis of greit Majesty,
And with good countenance they said to me:
We are cum heir, to the (o woeful wycht,
To cause the write, that thing thou seis this nycht
For we are knit, in band maryit togidder,
And to this woundit wycht father and mother.
We him begat within their twenty eiris,
Thocht deid like now he so to the appeiris.
We brocht him up, as our deir Sone and air,
And he to serve us, na travel did spair.
Thocht Atropus hes maid his Corpse decay,
Zit Immortal in heuin his Saul dois stay.
And als Immortal he sall with us rest,
And we with him, sa lang as world may lest.
Good Schir (quod I) and e also Madame
Be not offendit, that I speir our Name,
How call they ow, that talkis sa hamely with me?
And quhat is he, that first appeirit unto me?
That woundit man, quhome e do call our child
Quhat is our Names, lat se how ar e stylde.
Quod they my Sone, of that we think na schame,
Honor I am, heir with my Spous good fame.
This woundit Child of ouris thou may lament,
He was thy Master ainis, and our Regent.
My Master ainis (quod I) it is he so,
Nay, nay, (quod they) he is with us ago.
We haif him taine out of that wickit life,
And red him of all misery and strife.
Because e warldlingis ar ane Cursit Clan
Ze war not worthy of this godly man,
Allace (quod I) deid like he dois appeir,
Be still (quod they) and to our sayingis heir,
Speid, speid, go to, tak pen, Ink, paper and write,
As we honor, and good fame sall Indyte.
First thou sall wit, he was Sone Natural
To James the Fyft, our King and Prince Royal
Thocht beand oung, to Kirkis he was promotit,
Zit we his heart with Martial deidis dotit.
For than the Lord, sa blissit his affairis,
That forth of Fyfe he chaist his aduersairis.
With help of gentill men, and subiectis to him,
The quhilkis war willing all service to do him.
Their we begat him, and maid him our awin,
As he is, was, and sa sall ever be knawin,
Syne after that he passit in to France
Quhair he did us, and we did him auance.
Than having leirnit their sum French langage
He brocht agane with us his pucelage,
Now to be schort, it war lang to discern,
The godly giftis, that this our Sone did learn.
For as in aige he daily did Iucres
In vertew sa grew he and lawlynes,
First he did leirne to lufe God above all,
And syne his Nichtbour with lufe mutual,
True Faith he leirnit of good Abraham
with hoip and cheritie knit to the same,
He leirnit als of Solomon the wisdom,
How with the feir of God to reule ane Kingdom,
Of strange Sampsone he had also the fors,
For to resist Gods foes on fute and horse.
Thocht their tratours that dressed him in this case,
Durst not present their force befoir his face.
He had likewise the Justice of Iethro,
And als the Chastity of Scipio.
He had of David the beningnitie,
And of Titus the liberality.
Quhat wald thou moir, to tell of all his vertus,
For commoun welthis, he did excel Camillus.
Quhen pleisit God, to send ow Scottis ye treuth,
The same to further, at Leith he was not sleuth.
Reforming first his awin with diligence,
In every quarter quhair he had puissence.
Than was he stylir Lord James at that tide.
To quhome our Lordis gaif sum reule and gyde.
Sone after that, our Queen ane wedow was,
The quhilk to bring in Scotland he did pas.
In France he went, and brocht that Lady hame,
Quha efterwart agane changit his name:
Bot it we maryit him, quhen we thocht good,
Unto ane Lady of hie kyn and blude.
Than did our Queen make him both Earl and lord.
Of Murray land, to quhilk we did accord.
Sa condiscendit all our Lordis togidder,
That nixt our Queen, he should reule above other
Bot than allace, he did sum thing without us,
Howbeit that all his lyfetyme he did dout us:
He did permit our Queen to haif ane Mes,
Throw quhilk at le^th scho grew in greit proudnes
Sa did the Papistis all athort this land,
Aganis the Lord, his will, law and command.
That e almaist amangis ow were deuydit,
Were not be him, all was the better gydit.
Sa lang in Court, as our Sone had the steir,
And that our Queen wald his good counsel heir:
Sa lang all thing eid weill, and was weill dressed,
In quyetnes, peace, policy, and rest.
Nane durst rebel, on ather side of Forth,
Over all this cuntrie, Eist, west, South, and North.
The hiest of them all, he maid full law,
That did rebel, aganis Justice and Law.
Than did our Queen sum time with us abide,
In France and Scotland, both we did her gyde:
Bot at the last in her tranquillity,
Scho did us all abandoun wantounlie,
And turnit day in nycht, and nycht in day,
All the nycht lang, to sport, sing, dance, and play.
Till at the last, both Cupido, and Venus,
Forth of ye Court, gart baneis, chais, and stan^ us
Than come dishonor, and Infame our fais,
And brocht in ane, to reule with raggit clais.
Thocht he was blak, and Moriane or hew,
In credit sone, and gorgius clais he grew.
Thocht he was foreign, and borne in Piemont,
Zit did he Lords of ancient blude surmont.
He was to her, both secreit, true, and traist,
With her estemit, mair nor all the raist.
In yis mean time, come hame yan my lord Daclie
Of quhais rair beauty, scho did sumpart farlie:
The fairest sycht, scho thocht that ever scho saw,
Her beauty als, did him in her snair draw,
For to be schort, they lufit sa togidder,
That they culd not be hour of day but other.
At last scho said, and caist in to her mind,
Quhat, quhat, sall I, be thus with Cupide pynde,
That will I not, bot go to my purpois,
Zit first I will, my mind to sum disclois.
Than with good vult, and visage meik and mylde,
Brother (quod scho) scho said unto our Child:
Will e not weill, that I marie ane man,
Both of our Surname, kynreid, blude, and clan:
Lo this is he, standing befoir our face,
Lusty good like, and cum of Royal race.
Him will I marie, and nane other wycht,
Witness heirof, to him my treuth I plycht.
In our presence, desyring ow likewise,
That e be witness to this Interpryse.
Quhat wald thou mair, without all friends consent
This Lord scho maryit, quhen they were absent.
Quha was bot oung, and culd not reule the King,
And they dispersed, that should haif done sic thing.
Sa this stranger, and fallow of na kin,
In Thuring borne, and was ane Menstrells sone.
Begouth to reule, and callit Seineour David,
Be quhome our King, and Lords war all dissauid
It wald be lang on this matter to stand,
Our Sone they chaist syne after in Ingland,
With sindrie other Lordis that went unto him,
The quhilkis were all of ane opinioun with him.
Be this David our Lordis did this sustene,
Be him our King was lychtlyit with our Queen
Be him all thing was reulit in the Court,
For him come all this cummer, strife and stourt.
Throw him, in him, be him, our Court was gydit
Quhill that our King and Lordis culd not abide it.
The quhilks schortly in Cou^sall did co^fidder,
And with ane mind they did consent togidder,
David to slay, quhair ever they mycht haif him.
Concluding thus, on nycht they did persaue him
At Supper time, quhair he was in her Chalmer,
Than come our king, and sum Lords with ane glamer.
And reft him from her, in spyte of his nois,
Syne schot him forth, quickly amang his fois.
Quha stickit him, withouttin process moir,
Bot all this mischief come sensyne thairfoir:
Howbeit scho was sone closit up beliue,
Her Bairdis defendit, and her self Captine,
Zit culd scho not in heart sic thing foret,
Bot baid her time, quhill scho her time mycht get.
Than come their Lords, the nixt morn after hame,
And may humbly our Sone, halsit that Dame.
Quha was with Child, and neir sax monethis gone
And him forgaif, and maid to him her moan.
Say and brother, allace had e been heir,
I had not cum in all this sturt and steir.
My Secretar is slane in my presence,
Oh, oh brother, allace quhat greit offense?
Madame (quod he) cair not that is small tynsall
He was our fo, and gaif our grace evil counsall.
Weill, weill, (quod scho) at leist brother lat se,
Gif e can set me at full liberty.
For I am keipit as in Presoun heir,
And na seruand of mine dar cum me neir:
With her fair wordis, he set her clean at fredome,
By our advise, quhilk was bot lytill wisdom.
For to Dunbar that nycht scho raid in haist,
Behind ane man in poist, as scho war chaist.
Their come till her anew of men fra hand,
Quhilkis chaist our Lords sone after in Ingland.
Quhair they remanit baneist and absent.
Quhill France and Ingland maid thappoyntment
This quhen we thocht ilk thing was weill aggreit
Zit was our Quenis heart na wayis satisfeit.
Bot with bothwell scho maid conspiracy,
Seikand the way to cause her husband die.
Heir we lat pas, greit tressounis they committit
Quhilks for schortnes of time, we haif omittit.
Bot of our King, schortly for to declair,
Bothwell with pulder blew him in the air:
At her requeist, quhilk is ane thing weill knawin,
As sen syne tauld sum seruands of their awin.
The quhilk bothwell, for all his fylthie body
Maryit he was, unto ane Nobill Lady.
Bot it our Queen, be wrang law falsely forcit,
Maid him and her, from other be deuorsit:
Than went our Sone, schortly in France agane,
Quhair that we three, togidder did remane.
Sa in our absence, maryit scho bothwell,
Quha did her husband kill, as thou hard tell:
Of this our Nobills, culd not be content,
With burghis and co^mounis, fordwarts forth they went.
Quhair they met other, upon Carbarrie hill,
Tuke her, he fled, and na blude they did spill.
Than in Lochleuin, scho was put as in waird,
Thocht efrerwart, scho had ane sleuthfull gaird.
Zit did our Lords, auyse them of ane thing,
To crown her Sone, our Prince, and make him king
Quhilk act they did, with his Motheris consent
Confirmit be the Lords in Parliament.
And than because, he was over oung to govern
Amangis them selfis, wyslie they did discern:
For to elect our Sone in his absence,
Regent to be, unto our oungly Prence.
Than did our Lords, send for him to cum hame,
With him come we, both honor, and good fame.
All burghs and co^mounis, halelie did yai loif him,
Bot sindrie said, that they wald haif nane of him:
Sa gydit he, ane quhyle with patience,
Quhill he mycht to his fais make resistance.
Bot at the last, our Queen was lattin forth,
Conuoyit away, be sum was lytill good worth;
And speedily, to Hammiltoun scho went,
Quhair scho fand men, anew Incontinent:
The quhilks dispysit, us honor and fame
Thairfoir all turnit to their utter schame.
Our Sone and we, were than in Glasgow town
To hald the airis, in they parts he was bowne.
Than come scho fordwart, with her strenth and fors,
Ma than seuin thousand, quhat on fute and horse.
Yea two for ane, we think they were agane us,
The town to leave, yai thocht than to co^strane us
Bot we the Langsyde hill befoir them wan,
And be Gods grace, disconfeist yame ilk man:
We tuke and flew, scho fled in to Ingland,
Quhair scho is it, not at her awin command:
Our Sone cryit out, lat na mair blude be sched,
Bot tak and saif, the rest that now be fled.
In deid yat day, yair was slane in yat place,
Ma Hammiltounis, nor any other race:
Howbeit the rest, of them may graciously
He did intreit, with pardoun and mercy.
They him rewardit with Ingratitude,
And traterously this nycht hes sched his blude.
After this field, our Sone in Ingland went,
We left him not, bot was with him present,
Than did sum Lords, lift up yair hornis on hie,
Quhilks did withstand our Kingis authority.
Bot he come hame, agane or ever they wist,
And yair Rebellioun schortly did resist:
Sone after him, did cum hame my Lord Duke,
For Civil weir, yan every man did luke:
Bot God the Lord, brocht all sa weill to pas,
That without blude, all weill aggreit was:
Except my Lords, the Duke and Hereis both,
Were put in waird, yair was na other skaith:
Quhair they ar it, unto yis time and tide,
And will be their, quhill sum men get ye gyde.
Sone after this to Liddisdaill he went,
Quhairof the theifis, and sit war not content:
For to their Chyftanis he maid biggingis bair
As efterwart they did repent full sair.
Than come he north schortly he tuke na rest,
Till all that country had componit and dressed:
The hiest of them all, that wald Rebel,
He maid him stoup, and als to know himsell.
This being done, amang all other thing,
He maid them all subscriue unto the King:
Both far and neir* of hie and law degree,
Acknawledgeing the Kingis authority
Except Lord Fleming, nane war in this land,
Bot to the Kingis grace, had they geuin yair bam
Sa having stablischt all thing in this sort,
To Liddisdaill agane he did resort.
Throw Ewisdaill, Esdaill, and all the Daills rai^ h^
And also lay three nychtis in Cannabie:
Quhair na Prince lay their hundredth eiris befoir,
Na theif durst steir, they did him feir so soir.
And that they should na mair their thift allege,
Three scoir and twelf he brocht of them in pledge,
Syne wardit yam, quhilk maid ye rest keip ordour
Than mycht the Rasche bus keip ky on ye bordour
Quhen he this thocht till haif been at his eais,
In come on him the Queen of Inglandis fais.
The quhilks to seik, he tuke purpois fra hand,
Without delay* he gat Northumberland:
He socht him so, and fand him at the last,
And pat him in Lochleuin quhair he is fast.
Than went he suddanly to Dunbartane,
In snaw, sleit, drift, wind, froist, hailstanis and rane.
In deid like snaw, their words were soft and fair,
Like fieit, quhylis scharp, with promysis may bair
Like dryft also, they did drive of the time,
Till ane falls tratour suid commit this crime.
Like as the froist dois freis up all fresche watter
They freisit him in Stirling on this matter.
Windy it was, and windic was the sessoun*
As is ye French Proverb, grand vant, grand tressou^
With scharp hailstanis, they schot him trateroussie
Like rane in greit wind, syne fled suddanlie.
Sa may we weill, the time to deid compair,
For all was trublit, both se, land and air.
On Sunday than, the quhilk was isterday,
Unto this town, he come soupit and lay:
Dynit this day, and Just at aleuin houris
Their was ane knaif of his Conspiratouris,
Ane Hammiltoun within the bischoppis stair,
Quhilk schot him as thou seis withouttin mair:
Syne at the bak et, suddanlie he fled,
Sum saw him weill, and followit his horse tred.
Quhilk horse was knawin, bela^ging to lord Iohue
Quha with the rest, this act maid to be done.
Bot to our Sone we keipit cumpanie,
Quhilk in our arms, within this hour did die.
Than deit with him all vertus Cardinal,
Than deit with him Justice Imperial:
For in his time, Gods word was trewly preichit,
And in his time, Collegis rychtlie teichit.
Not only lufit he vprychteousnes,
Bot als he hatit vice and vitiousnes:
Not only did he lufe God and him ken,
Bot als he hatit all ungodly men.
To Sessioun als, ilk day he went to se,
Gif Justice was their Ministrate trewlie.
The rich and pure, he did alyke regaird.
Puneist the evil, and did the good rewaird
He wald not lat* the Papists cause ga bak,
Gif it were Just, bot wald be for him frak.
He wald not thoill, the proud oppres the pure,
Sa far as he, had Regiment and cure.
He did disdane, pride and ambitioun,
He lufit men, meik of Conditioun:
He did disdane all foull and fylthie word,
In any sort, outher in eirnist or bourd.
May diligent he was to ryn athort,
To gif the wedow, and fatherles confort:
May diligent, to heir the pure ma^nis bill,
And gif answer, according to Gods will.
Sober he was, in meir, in drink, and claithis,
He wald not thoill, blaspheming nor na aithis:
Reddy to heir, quhen any man spak to him,
Mistraisting not, yat any wald undo him.
Peace and concord, over all for to mantene,
The pure durst leif yair bestiall on the grene.
For stauchter mercy wald he never grant,
Both murtherars, theifis, and Vitches he did dane
For to be schort, lay all our heidis togidder,
Gif e can find amang ow sic ane other.
Get up (quod they) it is almaist midnycht,
With yat all three, they went out of my sycht:
Because ane man was knoking at the et,
Quhair I did ly, and had my self foret.
Sa raise I up, all cled in bute and spur,
Quhais yat (quod I) yat knokis at the dur?
I our good friend, and Nychthour answerit he,
Gar oppin the et, good brother now lar se*
Brother (quod I) how dois my Lord I pray ow
Departit oh, (quod he) and deid I say ow:
Allace (quod I) I find my Dreme over true,
And that full sair, all Scotland sone will rue.
Than to the Palice went I, and eid in,
Their weiping vocis, hard I making din:
Within the Chalmer I went quhair he departit,
Quhilk sycht to se, God wait maid me sair hartit:
Than come I forth agane, and saw my Lady,
Quhais horsis at the foir et were alreddy.
To Edinburgh scho went with heart full soir,
Revenge his deith e Lords, I say na moir.
Epitaphe.
Heir lyis the Corpse (good pepill) of a Princ^
Quhais Saul in heuin, with God is glorifeit:
James Regent was, murdreist without offense
Be ane falls tratour, sa knawin and notifeit.
Quha was anis bound, to haif been Iustifeit,
He gaif him grace, allace aganis all ressoun:
O Hammiltoun, it schawis weill thou was feit,
Be all that Clan, for to commit this tressoun.
Quhat mouit the to do yis Insolence?
And make yat Clan, sa to be falsifeit:
To quho^e God knawis, he schew his greit cleme^ce
Thocht thou with tressoun hes him gratifeit.
With all good vertewis he was amplifeit,
With all soull vice, thou hes defylde yair Mai^oun
Ressetting the, now haif they varefeit,
That they been weill contentit of this crasoun.
In deid I grant, that his greit patience,
Aganis him self, this deid hes testefeit:
For had he put ow down with diligence
our tressoun had, not this been ratifeit.
e were anis all in his will signifeit,
At the Langsyde, sensyne in every sessoun:
Now with greit honor is he Magnifeit,
And with greit schame, e sall thoil for this tressou^
