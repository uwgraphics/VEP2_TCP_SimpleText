The lamentation of a bad Market,
OR, The Drownding of three Children on the Thames.
With this fantastic Tragy Comedy,
It Is like that one or other pleased will be;
Because the Method carry, Mirth there^n,
Or else the Subject were not worth a pin:
However you will say it is no laughing matter,
To see poor Children Drowned in the Water.
Tune of, The Ladies Fall.
With Allowance.







SOme Christian people all give ear,
unto the grief of us,
Caused by the death of three children dear,
the which it happned thus.
And eke there befell an accident;
by fault of a Carpenters Son,
Who to saw chips, his sharp Axe lent,
woe worth the time may Lon.
May London say woe worth the Carpenter,
and all such Block-head fools,
Would he were hanged like Serpent here,
for jesting with edged Tools.
For into the chips there fell a Spark,
which put out in such flames.
That it was known into Southwark,
which lies beyond the Thames.
For lo the Bridge was wondrous high,
with water underneath;
Over which as many Fishes fly,
as Birds therein do breath.
And yet the fire consumed the bridge,
not far from place of landing,
And though the building was full big,
it fell down not with standing.
And eke into the water fell,
so many Pewter Dishes,
That a man might take up very well,
both boiled and roasted Fishes.
And thus the Bridge of London Town,
for building that was sumptuous,
Was all by fire half burnt down,
for being too contumptious.




Thus you have all, but half my Song,
pray list to what comes after,
For now I have cooled you with the fire,
i will warm you with the water.
I Will tell you what the Rivers name is,
where these children did slide-a:
It was fair Londons silver Thames,
that keeps both tune and Tide-a.
All on the tenth of J^nuary,
to the wonder of much people,
It Was frozen over that well 'twould bear,
almost a Country Steeple.
Three children sliding thereabouts,
upon a place too thin,
That so at last it did fall out,
that they did all fall in.
A gallant that was standing near,
a willing wager makes,
But when he saw it would not bear,
he would have drawn his stakes.
He said 'twould bear a man to slide,
and laid a hundred pound:
The other said 'twould break, so it did,
for three children there were drowned.
Of which ones head from his Should --
ers stricken, whose name was John,
Who then cried out as loud as he could,
O Lon, O Lon, a London.
Oh, Tut, Tut, Turn from thy sinful race,
thus did his speech decay,
I wonder that in such a case,
he had no more to say.
And thus being drowned, alack, alack,
the water run down their throats,
And stopped their breaths 3 hours by the clock,
before they could get any Boats.
Ye Parents all that chidren have,
and ye that have none yet,
Preserve your children from the grave,
and teach them at home to sit.
For had these at a Sermon been,
or else upon dry ground,
Why then I would have never been seen,
if that they had been drowned.
Even as a Huntsman ties his dogs,
for fear they should go fro him,
So tie your children with strict clogs,
unty um and you will undo um.
Let Maids and Nurses lie in wait,
and watch them to a tittle,
Because your grief will be full great,
to have them dye so little.
A Story you have heard is called,
The Children in the Wood.
Although the Subjects both are bad,
yet this may be as good.
And now for to conclude at last,
I wish all others may,
Be careful of their children dear,
for fear they go astray.
FINIS.
