ORMONDE.

WWhereas Diverse Officers of his Majesty's Army in this Kingdom, do take
Liberty at their own pleasure, to absent themselves from the places wherein
they are Garrisoned without License from Us, and many others who obtain License
do stay from their duty beyond the time allowed them, to the great danger of
the places where their charge lies, and contrary to all Discipline; These are
therefore in prevention of so great neglect of Duty, and of the inconveniency
that may thereupon ensue, to signify to all concerned that whatever Officer
shall absent himself from his Garrison, although between Musters, for above the
space or ten days and nights without License obtained upon just, and true
allegacions, of the necessity of his going else where, shall without Demission
be put out of his Employment, and whoever shall stay from his Garrison above
ten days and nights longer then the time allowed him, shall incurr the same
penalty of loosing his employment, except such Officers as shall between the
Musters only, repair to the head Quarters, where We are in Person, who shall
immediately upon their Coming present them selves to Us, in order to their
receiving Our Commands, Provided always that in this last case there be at
that time two Commissioned Officers at the least remaining with the Lroop or
Company, but if the Officer Commanding in theif be a Member of the Priby
Council or a Peer of this Kingdom, the Inferior Officer desiring to use the
Liberty aforesaid of reparing to the place where We are, he shall be oblidged
to leabe if he be an Officer of Horse, two Commissioned Officers, if of foot,
one Commissioned Officer, to reside in his absence, and We do further require
that when any Subaltern Officer or Soldier shall present his Petition to Us
for License to be absent from his Garrison he do at the same time produce a
Certificate under the Hand of his Superior Officer, signifing to Us that he may
be spared from his Duty for the time desired; without prejudice to the service,
and if any Superior Officer shall wilfully and without cause given, refuse to
give such Certificate to the Subaltern Officer or Soldier he shall set forth
his case to Us, and We will give Order in the Matter, as We shall see cause to
do.
