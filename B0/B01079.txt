persons, that is to say, the Father, the Gene. 1. 26. John. 1. 1. cap. 10. 30.
Son, and the holy Ghost, which be of one substance, like unmeasurable, and

Re. 15. 22
to hear it, and to keep it.

The second part, is prayer, by the which we worship God, and Psa. 50. 15.
Mat. 6. et. 7 Luke 18. Psa. 141. 2. Psa. 148. 13 Psa. 51. 15. Romans 12. 1. Hebr.
13. 1. Pete. 2. 5. Psa. 116. 11 et. 12. us.
call upon him for all things.

The third, is the Sacrifyce of praise, from a faithful heart, for the Lord
requires nothing of us, for all his benefytes bestowed upon us: but to be
thankful, calling upon his name, and obey his word.

The fowrth part, of the service Psalm. 2. 11. Leuit. 26. 2. Eccle. 4. 17 Iere.
7. 9. Dau. 9. 10. Exo. 17. 11 Hebr. 5. 7.
of God, is the humble submission of the spyrite, with saythfull reverence, and
fear: for there is neither true obedience, true invocation, nor yet true
Sacrifice of praise, where the submission of the spirit is wanting.


Demand. What are the Laws of God?


Answer. GOD spoke all these words, and Exodus 20. 1.
said, I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the Land of
Egypt, out out of the house of bondage.

1 Thou shall have none other Gods but me.

Thou shall not make to thy self any graven Image, nor the likeness of any
thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water under
the earth, thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship them. For I the Lord
thy God am a gelious God, and visit the sins of the Fathers upon the
children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me: And show
mercy unto thousands, in them that love me and keep my commandments.

3 Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord
will not hold him guiltless, that takes his name in vain.

4 Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day: Six days shall thou labor, and
do all that thou have to do. But the seventh day, is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God: In it thou shall do no manner of work, thou and thy son, and thy
Daughter, thy man servant, and thy maid servant, thy Cattle, and the
Stranger that is within thy gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and
earth: the Sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore
the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.

5 Honor thy Father, and Mother, that thy days may be long in the Land,
which the Lord thy God gives thee.

6 Thou shall do no murder.

7 Thou shall not commit adultrie.

8 Thou shall not steal.

9 Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.

10 Thou shalt not desire thy neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy
neighbors wife, nor (...) servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass,
nor any thing that is thy neighbors.


Demand. Art thou bound to observe these precepts, in thought, word and
deed.


Answer. Ezec. 18. 10. Luke. 2. 10. Leuit. 18. 5. Math. 5. 28
Yea, and if I break but one of them, in thought, word or deed, once only
in all my life: I shall be guilty of eternal death.


Demand. Do thou keep them?


Answer. Romans 1. 3 cap. 7.
No, nor no man verily.


Demand. Then thou grauntest thy self, all men worthy of Gods displeasure,
and eternal dampnation?


Answer. Romans 1. 18 cap. 2. 8. Deuteronomy. 27. 1. Cor. 6. 9. Mat. 25. 41
Yea, verily, I feel Gods wrath, and dampnation, to be my reward.


Demand. How shalt thou escape Gods wrath, and this dampnation?


Answer. Only by Jesus Christ.


Demand. How shall he save thee?


Answer. Because he being John. 10. 30. cap. 14. 28.
God, and man, has E^a. 53. Math. 8. 17
suffered all the punishment due for my sins, and To. 10. 40
has fulfilled the law.


Demand. Art thou so freelye redeemed by Christ, that thou need do
Sacrifysing Priest, or any other merit, or means, to help thee to salvation?


Answer. Yea, verelie, for To. 4. 25. cap. 7. 24. cap. 5. 1. cap. 8. 2.
Christ was delivered for my sin, and rose again for my iustificacion: and
has To. 3. 24 1. Pet. 2. 24 1. Ioh. 1. 7.
freely paid my ransom to his Father.


Demand. Shall all men be saved by Christ?


Answer. No, Ioh. 8. 24 31. et. c. us. cap. 15. 5. Romans 6. 5. Head. 3. 14.
none but such as believe effectually in him, and live thereafter.


Demand. Who believes thus in him?


Answer. They ^. Ioh. 2. 12. cap. 3. 2.
only that assure then selves, that all his sufferinges was for them, and so
travel 1. Ioh. 3. 3.
mortifycation of the flesh.


Demand. Who works in thee, this belief, and this mortifycation?


Answer. The holy ghost does work it me, by Ioh. 1^. 3 I^^. 1. 18. cap. c. 6.
Romans 10. 17 Psalm. 19. 7. 1 Timothy 4. 16
hearing the word preached.


Demand. May every one that believes effectually, and travel to mortify A
^^raunce of salvation.
the flesh, by the help of the spyrite: assure them selves of salvation.


Answer. Yea, verelie, for Saint Paul says, Romans 8. 1. 2. et. 14. v, To. 5.
1. etc. 1. John. 3. 2. 1. Cor. 13. 5 John. 5. 24 et. 26. us. cap. 11. 25. cap.
8. 26.
there is no dampnation, to them that are in Christ Jesus: Which walk not
after the flesh, but after the spirit.


Demand. May every man that travel, not mortifycation of the flesh, but
lives in fylthy sin: assure him self of salvation?


Answer. No not so. For he is the Phi. 3. 18 Reave. 3. 9. 1. Cor. 6. Math. 25.
enemy of Christ: and does Heb. ^. 6.
crucify the son of God. etc.


Demand. That we may the better understand, that thou art the child of God,
through faith in Jesus Christ: declare the effect of thy belief?


Answer. I believe in God the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth. And
in Jesus Christ, his only Son our Lord: which was conceived by the holy
ghost, borne of the virgin Marie. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, dead and buried, he descended into hell, and the third day he rose
again from death. He ascended into Heaven, and sytteth on the right hand of
God the Father almighty. From thence shall he come to judge both the quick
and the dead. I believe in the holy Ghost. The holy Catholic Church. The
Communion of Saints. The forgiveness of sins. The resurrection of the body.
And the life everlasting. So be it.


Demand. Is thy faith perfect as soon as thou beleeuest?


Answer. Not so: but increases by Romans 10. 17. cap. 1. 16. Ephe. 4. 7.
hearing the word of God: using Lu. 21. 36.
prayers, and 1. Cor. 11. 26.
Sacraments.


Demand. Thou say, prayers is a help to increase thy faith?


Answer. Yea, for it Mat. 7. 11
assures me that I shall have all things that I ask for, in Christ's name,
agreeing to his will.


Demand. What things may thou pray for, agrreeing to the will of God?


Answer. For Ioh. 16. 24. Iac. 5. 16.
joy, and for the increase of love, between all degrees: Iac. 1. 5. 3. Reg. 3.
for heavenly wisdom: for the Luke 11. 13
holy ghost. To be delivered from evil in the time of Math. 26
temptation. For to obtain Luke 21. 36. us.
mercy of our heavenly Father.


Demand. Is God content, and pleased with every man's prayer?


Answer. No: for if we pray to him, not agreeing to his will, he will ^o^
hear us.


Demand. What things are not agreeing to his will, that we may not pray for?


Answer. To pray to them that be dead for any thing: as to the virgin Marie,
or any other, for any thing, is not agreeing to his will. For we have but
only 1. Ioh. 2. 1 1. Tim. 2. 5 John. 14. 6. Mat. 11. 28
one mediator, to pray for us, and that is Christ.


Demand. Does them that be deaf, hear when they be prayed unto?


Answer. No, for the Prophet Esaias says unto the Lord: thou 1. Esa. 6;. 6
art our Father, for Abraham knows us not, neither is Israel acquainted with
us.


Demand. May we pray for them that be dead?


Answer. No, for it is not agreeing to ye will of God. For 1. Ioh. 5. 14. 2.
Re. 12. 22. Eccle. 17. 18 Luke. 16. 26
Saint John says, there is a sin unto death, I say not, that thou should
pray for it.


Demand. What say thou of them that live in fylthie sins, are their
prayers heard?


Answer. No, for 1. Reg. 25 22. Pro. 28. 9. John. 4. 7.
disobedience, and wicked Esa. 59. 1 Psa. 66. 16. Iere. 7. 9.
sins, is the cause that God will not hear our prayers.


Demand. What is prayer?


Answer. It is a peticion made unto God, for things that we have need of,
with the affection of the heart.


Demand. How many kind of prayers be there?


Answer. Psa. 50. 15.
Two: Invocation, and prayer.


Demand. What is Invocation?


Answer. It is, whereby God is called upon in any thing.


Demand. How many things be required in prayer?


Answer. Four. The commandment of God. The promise: Faith, and the things
desired.


Demand. What is the first?


Answer. The commandment of GOD which Psalm. 50. Mat. 6. et. 7 Luke. 18.
commands us to pray, and call upon him: and as it is sin to swear, so it
is 1. Reg. 12 23.
sin not to pray.


Demand. What is the second?


Answer. The promise of God, which certifyeth us yt our prayers are heard in
Christ's name. For Christ says, John. 16. 23. Math. 7. Luke. 11. 13 Psa. 50.
15. Acts. 12. 5.
whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.


Demand. What is the third?


Answer. Faith, for we must believe that our sins are forgeuen us, when we
pray with pensive hearts. Mark. ^1. 24. Iac. 1. 5. Math. 8. 2.
For Christ says, what thing so ever when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them.


Demand. What is the fowrth?


Answer. The thing that is asked?


Demand. What things must we ask?


Answer. For heavenly wisdom from b. Iac. 1. Luke 11. 3. Reg. 3.
above, and we shall have it.

Math. 26 Psalm. 50. 15.
In the time of trouble, seek for help from above, and it shall be delivered.

Math. 11. 28.
If any man be werie of the burden of sin, let him ask for mercy, and he
shall have it.

Does any man lack John. 16. 23. Ezech. 18.
love, from a pure heart toward God, and man, let him pray for it, and God will
give it him. Or whatsoever we have need of, as we are taught in the Lords
prayer.


Demand. What is the Lords prayer?


Answer. It is a brief form of praying, which Christ taught his disciples,
and all faithful men: saying. When ye pray, say thus.

Our father which art in heaven, Math. 6.
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in
heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive the^ that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation. But
deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and glory, now
and for ever. Amen.


Demand. How many Sacraments be there?


Answer. Two, the Lords Supper, and Baptism.


Demand. What is a Sacrame^^*


Answer. It is a holy sign instituted of God, to confyrme my faith, and to
seal in my heart, the promises of Gods mercy toward me, for the
forgiveness of my sins, and salvation in Christ.


Demand. W^^^ are Sacraments in gene^^^^*


Answer. They are visible signs, which sygnifie unto us, both grace and
conjunction with Christ, and seal unto us the promises of salvation, Genesis 17.
4 et. 10. us.
for God delivered unto us sacraments, as seals of his promises, and when we
have received them, Gal. 3. 27
they bear witness that we belong unto Christ.


Demand. Who gave the sacraments?


Answer. The author and geuer of the sacraments, is God the Genesis 27. 10.
Father, Mar. 16. Math. 26.
and his son Jesus Christ our Lord.


Demand. Are there seven sacraments, as the Bishop of Rome affyrmeth?


Answer. No, but two, as we have said before: for the other sacraments, can
be no sacraments, because they want the manifest words of promise, which
should by a visyble sign be sealed, and because there is no commandment
given of God, whereby we are bound to observe them as sacraments.


Demand. What do you come to receive?


Answer. The holy sacrament of the body, and blood of Christ.


Demand. Why do thou come to receive it?


Answer. Because God has commanded me, Lu. 22. 19 1. Cor. 11.
saying: do this in remembrance of me.


Demand. Of how many parts, consists a sacrament?


Answer. Of two parts. The outward Element, being a visible sign: and the
invisible grace.


Demand. What is the outward sign?


Answer. Math. 26
Bread and Wine, which the Lord has commanded to be received.


Demand. What is the heavenly part?


Answer. It is the body and blood of Christ which was broken for me, and
Math. 27 John. 19. 34.
shed for me, which is eaten and dronken of the faithful, spirituallie.


Demand. Is the Bread and Wine, changed into the body and blood of Christ?


Answer. No, for then the nature of the Sacrament were destroyed. For God
ordained it to be received in the Math. 29 Luke. 22. Augu. To eat Christ, is
to be refreshed, and to drink him is to live.
remembrance of his death.

The bread sacramentally, is the Lords body, and so likewise the cup.

The cup naturally, is a cup of wine, but sacramentally, it is the cup
of the Lords blood and new Testament.

Christ called it his blood, not that his blood should be really in it, but
that it should be the Sacrament of his blood,


Demand. Was this Supper ordained of Christ, to be offered as a Sacrifice to
God the Father for remission of sins?


Answer. No truly, for when Christ dyed upon the Cross, he Heb. 7. 27 cap.
9. 21. et. c. cap. 10. 10. 14. 18. et. 26. us.
once fullye made, that only everlasting sacrifice, for our salvation for ever.

The bread was delivered to the Disciples: as the sacrament of the Lords body,
but the very body it self, should be given upon the cross, not to the
Disciples, but to God the father for the Disciples.


Demand. What is the Lords Supper?


Answer. It is the sacrament of my redemtion, by the death of Christ.


Demand. What think thou of the Lords Supper?


Answer. I believe that as my body is nourished with bread, and wine, there
broken, and powered for thee, that even so my soul is nourished spiritually by
Christ's body, broken, and his bloodshed; for the remission of my sins.


Demand. (...) Wherefore it is our duty to 1. Cor. 10 16. Math. 26.
give thanks at the Lords supper. And the Lord gave thanks thereat.

Thirdly, it puts us in remembrance, that as the bread which we eat, is
made of many grains, one loaf, and the grapes being many, pressed together,
is made one wine: so we being many, are Romans 11. 4. et. c. 1. Cor. 1^. 17 cap
12. 27.
one body, whereof Christ is the head.

Seeing then that, we are all one body, we ought to help one another, and to
Romans 1^. 2 I^^n. 3. 17. b. 1. Cor. ^3 ^. 2. et. c.
love one another.


Demand. What is our duty to do, that we may come to the Lords supper
rightly?


Answer. To examine our selves, whether we be true members of Christ,
depending our 2. Cor. 13. 5. Hebr. 11. 4.
faith wholly upon him, as our Act. 4. 12 Math. 1. 2*
only savior.

Secondly, to examine our selves, whether we be in love one with another,
Mat. 5. 23 cap. 18.
and forgive one another.

Thirdly, we must examine our selves, what sins we have committed, and
repent, that we may with a clear Sap. 17. Eccle. 18. Psa. 26. 6.
conscience, come to the Lords Table.


Demand. What is Baptism?


Answer. Baptism, is the Sacrament of our Tit. 3. 5.
regeneration: cleansing admission, sanctifycation, incorporation, admission,
whereby they which do Act. 2. 38
repent, and profess the faith, and Religion of Christ, are incorporated, and
Gal. 3. 27
consigned up to Christ and his Church.


Demand. Who did institute Baptism?


Answer. Mat. 28. Mark. 16.
Our savior Christ.


Demand. What does baptism signify?


Answer. It declares the 1. Pet. 1. 19. John. 3. 5. Act. 2. 38.
washing away of my sins by Christ's blood, and my new birth.


Demand. Can none assure them selves of salvation, unless they be Baptized?


Answer. I say not so, Gods grace is not tied to externe Elements, we
believe his Genesis 17. c Romans 4. 11
promise, and therefore doubt not, but the children of the faithful are
saved, although they pass away in their mothers womb, for they are holy by
virtue of the Ge. 17. 30
covenant. And are Ier. 1. 5. 1. Cor. 7. 14
sanctified in their mothers womb. For example Gene. 25 23. Romans 9. 9. et. 11.
us.
Isaac, which was borne the child of God, by virtue of the promise. Whereby it
follows that the promise is the fountain of salvation, and not the
sacrament. Another example, the L^. 2^. 24
thief that dyed with Christ asked for mercy, and was saved: where was he
baptized.


Demand. Is it in our will to be baptized, or not to be baptized?


Answer. We are Math. 28 Mark. 16. John. 3. 5.
commanded of Christ to be baptized, and therefore he that may be baptized,
and will not, he breaks the commandment of God, and is Ge. 17. 14 Reu. 22.
19
cursed.


Demand. May one fall from grace, after he is baptized?


Answer. Yea verelie, for whoremongers, swearers, and other wicked livers do
fall from the Gal. 5. 4. Tir. 1. 16.
grace, and as long as they remain in sin, they are Ep. 2. 12.
without God, and Ioh. 15. 6
cut of from the vine Christ, and can not be 1. Cor. 6. 9 Hebr. 10. 26 Math.
25.
saved, although they be baptized, unless they Luke 13. 4.
repent.

1. Pet. 3. 21.
Saint Peter says, Baptism takes not away the fylth of the flesh: But in
that a good conscience consenting to God, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
1. Cor. 7. 9 Romans 2. 25. Gal. 6, 15.
And S. Paul says: circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing,
but the keeping of the commandments of God. So then, Baptism is no cause of
our salvation. For example Act. 8. 27.
Simon Magus, which was baptized, and yet remained the child of the devil.


Demand. What deest thou promise, when thou art Baptized?


Answer. I promise to forsake the devil, the world, and the flesh, and to
be Christ's servant all the days of my life.


Demand. Dyddest thou never break this promise?


Answer. Yea, for if I swear, lie, steal, or do any other thing, contracie
to the will of God: I break my promise made unto God.


Demand. Whose servant art thou, when thou have broken thy promise: the
servant of God?


Answer. No, verelie, for Christ says, Ioh. 8. 34. Romans 6. 23. Math. 6. 24
he that commits sin, is the servant of sin.


Demand. What is the reward of this servant, for breaking his promise made
in Baptism?


Answer. Romans 6. 23 cap. 8. 6.
Dampnation, for Saint Pa^^ says, the reward of sin, is death*


Demand. What is done of thee now, seeing thou have forsaken thy promise,
(...), to live still in that state of dampnation?


Answer. No, but to remember my promise, and return unto God for the
remission of my sins, and for his holy spirit, to lead me into newness of
life.


Demand. Do thou think that God will receive thee, if thou repent, seeing
thou have broken thy promise in Baptism, and lived in fylthie sin many
years, serving 1. Ioh. 3. 8 et. 10. us.
the devil. etc.


Answer. Yea, truly, for Christ says, Luke 5. 32
I came to call the sinners to repentance: I am a sinner, and if I repent, and
forsake sin, I believe, I am become his Luke 15. 21. et. c.
servant again, and all my sins forgeuen me, ac^^rding to his Math. 11 28.
promise.


Demand. What difference is (...) ^^crament, and a sacrifi^^*


Answer. A Sacrament is a sign, or (...) of the promise of God, that he
gives unto us a certain thing. So was circumcision, a certain token whereby
he would c receive the Ge. 17. 10
circumcised. Baptism is a token whereby God works with us, and b receive us
unto grace. Gal. 3. 27


Sacrificium, is a work of ours, which we give unto God. Whereby we c honor
him. Psalm. 50.



Demand. How many kinds of Sacrifices be there?


Answer. Two, the one is called Propitiatorium, that is, which obtayneth
mercy, and appeaseth the wrath of God.

The other is called, Eucharisticum, that is to say, a thankesgeuing.


Demand. What is Sacrificium Propitiatorium.


Answer. It is a work, Esa. Math. 8.
deserving remission of sins, and deliverance from everlasting punishment:
and there is only Hebr. 9. et. 10.
one Sacrifice, which deserves remission of sins: that is to say, the death
and passion of Christ.


Demand. What is the Sacrifyce of thanksgeuing.


Answer. Psa. 50. et. 23. us. 1. Pet. 2. 5 Hebr. 13. 1.
It is a thankesgeuing unto God the Father, through Jesus Christ, the remission
of our sins, and for all other benefytes received of him. Therefore, whether
we eat ^r drink, or whatsoever we do, let us praise God, through Jesus
Christ our Lord, and say. Amen.
