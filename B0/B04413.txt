A most Godly and comfortoble ballad of the Glorious Resurrection of our Lord
Jesus Christ, how he triumphs over Death, Hell and Sin, whereby we are
certainly persuaded of our rising again from the dead.
The tune is, Rogero.


WHat fuithless froward sinful man,
so far from grace is fled,
That does not in his heart belive,
the rising of she dead.
Or why do wicked mor^all men,
their lives so vainly frame,
Which being dead they do suppose,
they shall not rise again.
For why if that the dead indeed,
which now consuming lies.
Shall not by God be raised again,
then Christ did never rise.
And if so be our Savior sweet,
did not rise from the death
Our preaching is of no efect
and vain is hope on Earth.
If Christ rose not again I say,
then are we yet in sin,
And they that fall asleep in him
no part of joy shall win.
Of all the creatures living then,
which God on earth did frame,
Most wretched are the states of men,
which spend their days in vain.
But Christ is risen up from dead,
as it was right and meet,
And thereby trod down death and hell*
and sin under his feet.
And that the same to simple men,
the plainer might appear.
The gracious rising of the Lord,
his word declares clear.
When he within the grave was laid,
the Jews did watchmen set,
Lest by his friends his corpse from thence
should secretly be sent.
A mighty stone likewise they did,
on his sepulcher role,
And all for fear his body should,
away from thence be stole.
But in the dead time of the night,
a mighty earthquake came,
The which did shake both Sea and Land
and all within the same.
And then the Angel of the Lord,
came down from heaven so high,
And rol'd away the mighty stone,
which on the Grave did lie.
The second part of the same tune,

HIs face did shine like flaming fire,
his Clothes were white as snow,
Which put the watch men in great fear,
who ran away for woe.
And told unto the High Priest plain,
what I do now rehearse,
Who hired them for many straight,
that they would hold their peace.
And say quoth he his Servants came,
which he sometimes did keep,
And secretly stole him away,
while we were found asleep.
And if that Herod hear thereof,
we will persuade him so,
That you shall find no hurt at all,
where ever you do go.
But faithful Mary Magdalen,
and James, his Mother too,
had brought great store of ointment sweet
as Jesus were wont to do.
Who rose up early in the morn,
before that it was day,
The body of the Lord t'noynt.
in Grave whereas he lay.
And then unto the Grave they ran,
they were in wondrous fear,
They saw a Young Man in the same,
but Christ they saw not there,
Then said the Angel unto them
why are you so at said,
The Lord whom you do seek I know,
is risen up he said.
Then went the women bo th away.
who told these tidings then,
To John and Peter who in have,
to the sepulcher ran,
Who found it as the woman said,
and then away did go,
But Mary stayed weeping still,
whose tears declared her woe.
Who looking down into the Grave,
two Angees there did see,
Quoth they why weeps this women so,
even for my Lord quoth she.
And turning then her self aside,
as she stood weeping so,
The Lord was standing at her back,
but him she did not know.
Why does this woman weep he said,
whom seeks she in this place,
She thought he had a Gardner been,
and thus she she woe her case.
If thou have born him hence she said,
then tell me where he is,
And for to fetch him back again,
besure I will not miss.
What Mary then our Savior said,
do thou lament for me,
O Master live thou again,
my soul does joy in thee,
O Mary touch me not he said.
ere I have been above,
Even with my God the only God,
and Father whom we love.
And often times did Christ appear,
to his Disciples all,
But Thomas would not it believe,
his Faith it was so small.
Except that he might thrust his hand
into the wound so wide,
And put his finger where the Spear,
did pierce his tender side.
Then Christ which knew all secrets,
to them again came he.
Who said to Thomas, here I am,
as plainly thou may see.
See here the hands which nails did pierce
and holes are in my side,
And be not faithless O thou man,
for whom these pains I bide,
Thus sundry times Christ showed himself
when he did rise again.
And then ascended into Heaven,
in Glory for to reign,
Where he prepaires a place for those,
whom he shall raise likewise,
To live with him in heavenly bliss,
above the lofty Skeyes.
FINIS.
