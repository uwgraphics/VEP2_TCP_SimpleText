Iniunccio^s given by the most excellent Prince, Edward the.VI. by the grace
of GOD, king of England, France, and Ireland: defendor of the faith, and in
earth under Christ, of the Church of England and of Irelande, the supreme
hedde: to all and synguler his loving Subjects, as well of the Clergy, as of
the Laity.
THE Kings most royal Majesty, by the advice of his most dear uncle, the
duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of all his Realms, Dominions, and subjects,
and Governor of his most royal person, and the residewe of his most
honorable counsel, intendyng thaduauncement of the true honor of almighty
God the suppression of Idolatry, and Supersticion, throughout all his Realms
and Dominions, and to plant true Religion, to the extirpacion of all Hypocrysy,
enormities, and abuses, as to his duty apperteineth: Does minister unto his
loving subjects, these Godly Iniunccio^s, hereafter following: Whereof, part
were given unto them heretofore, by authority of his most derely beloved
father, King Henry the eighte, of most famous memory, and part are now
ministered and given by his Majesty. All which Iniunccions, his highness
wills and commands his said loving subjects, by his supreme authority,
obediently to receive, and truly to observe and keep, every man in their
offices, degrees, and states, as they will avoid his displeasure, and the
pains in the same Iniunccions, hereafter expressed.

THE first is, that all Deanes, Achedeaco^s, Persons, Vicars, and other
Ecclesiastical persons, shall faithfully keep and observe, and as far as in
them may lie, shall cause to be observed and kept of other, al and singular
laws and statutes, made as well for the abolishyng and extirpacion of the bishop
of Rome, his pretensed and usurped power and iurisdiccion, as for the
establishement and confirmacion of the kings authority, iurisdiccio^ and
supremacy of the church of England, and Ireland. And furthermore, all
ecclesiastical persons, having cure of soul, shall to the vttermoste of
their wit, knowledge, and learning purely, syncerely, and without any color or
dissimulacion, declare, manifest, and open, iiij. times every year at the
least, in their Sermons, and other collacions, that the bishop of Romes usurped
power and iurisdiccio^, having no establishement nor ground by the law of God,
was of most just causes, taken away and abolished, and that therefore, no
manner of obedience or subieccion, within his Realms and Dominions, is dew
unto him. And that the Kings power, within his Realms and Dominions, is the
highest power under GOD, to whom all men, within the same Realms and Dominions,
by Gods laws owe most loyalty and obedience, before and above all other
powers and potentates in earth.

BESIDES this, to the intent that all Supersticion and Hypocrisy, crept into
diverse men's hearts, may vanish away, they shall not setfurthe or extol
any Images, Relics, or miracles, for any Supersticion or lucre, nor allure
the people by any inticementes, to the Pilgrimage of any saint or image: but
reprouyng the same, they shall teach, that all goodness, health and grace,
ought to be both asked and looked for only of God, as of the very aucthor and
geuer of the same, and of none other.

ITEM, that they, the persons above rehearsed shall make or cause to be made
in their Churches, and every other Cure they have, one Sermon, every quarter of
the year at the least, wherein they shall purely and syncerely, declare the
word of GOD: and in the same, exhort their hearers to the works of Faith,
Mercy, and Charity, specially prescribed and commanded in scripture, and
that works devised by man's pha^tasies, besides scripture: as wanderyng to
pilgrimages, offering of money, candelles or tapers, to Relics, or Images, or
kissyng and lickyng of the same, praiyng upon Beads, or such like
supersticio^, have not only no promise of reward in scripture, for doing of
the^: but contrariwise, great threats and malediccions of God for that they
be things, tendyng to Idolatry and supersticio^, which, of al other
offenses, god almighty does most detest and abhor for that the same diminishe
most his honor and glory.

ITEM, that such Images, as they know in any of their Cures, to be, or have
been so abused with pilgrimage or offrynges, of any thing made thereunto, or
shall be hereafter censed unto, they (and none other private persons) shall,
for the auoydyng of that most detestable offense of Idolatry, furthewith take
down or cause to be taken down, and destroy the same, and shall suffer from
hensefurthe, no Torches, nor Candelles, Tapers or Images of wax, to be set
before any Image or picture, but only two lights upon the high altar, before
the Sacrament which, for the significacion, that Christ is the very true
light of the world, they shall suffer to remain still: Admonishyng their
parishioners, that Images serve for no other purpose, but to be a remembrance,
whereby, men may be admonished, of the holy life's and conuersacio^ of them that
thesaied Images do represent: which Images, if they do abuse for any other
intent, they commit Idolatry in the same, to the great daungier of their souls.

ITEM, that every holy day throughout the year, when they have no Sermon, they
shall immediately after the Gospel, openly and plainly, recite to their
parishioners in the pulpit: The Pater noster, the Credo, and the ten
Commandments in English, to the intent the people may learn the same by
heart: exhortyng all parents and householders, to teach their children and
servants the same, as they are bound by the law of God, and in conscience to
do.

ITEM, that they shall charge fathers and Mothers, Masters and governors, to
bestow their children and Servants, even from their childhode, either to
learning, or to some honest exercise, occupacion or husbandry: Exhortyng and
counsailyng, and by all the ways and means they may, as well in their Sermons
and collacions, as otherways, perswadyng their said Fathers and Mothers,
Masters, and other Governors, diligentely to provide and forsee, that the
youth be in no manner of wise, brought up in idleness, least at any time
afterward, for lack of some craft, occupacion, or other honest mean to live
by, they be driven to fall to beggyng, stealyng, or some other unthriftiness:
For as much as we may daily se, through slothe and idleness, diverse valiant
men fall, some to beggyng, and some to theft and murdre, which after brought
to calamity and misery, do blame their parents, friends and governors,
which suffered them, to be brought up so idly in their youth, where, if
they had been well brought up, in good learning, some occupacion, or craft,
they should (being rulers of their own household) have proffited as well
themselfes, as diverse other persons, to the great commodity and ornament of
the common wealth.

ALSO, that thesaied persons, Vicars, and other Curates, shall diligently
provide, that the Sacraments, be duly and reverently ministered in their
Parishes. And if at any time it happen, them in any of the cases expressed in
the statutes of this Realm, or of special license given by the Kings
Majesty, to be absent from their benefices, they shall leave their Cure, not
to a rude and unlearned person, but to an honest well learned and expert
Curate, that can by his ability, teach the rude and unlearned of their cure,
wholesome doctrine, and reduce them to the right way that do err, and which
will also execute these Iniunccions, and do their duty otherwise, as they
are bound to do in every behalf: and accordyngly may and will proflite
their cure, no less with good example of living, then with the declaracion of
the word of God, or else their lack and defaulte, shall be imputed unto them,
who shall straightly answer for the same if they do otherwise. And always
let them see, that neither they nor their Curates, do seek more their own
proffite, promocion, or advantage, then the proffit of the souls, that they
have under their Cure or the glory of God.

ALSO, that they shall provide, within three months, next after this
visitacion, one book of the whole Bible, of the largest volume in English.
And within one twelfe months, next after the said visitacion, the
Paraphrasis of Erasmus also in English upon the Gospelles, and the same set
up, in some convenient place, within the said Church, that they have cure of,
whereas their parishioners may most co^modiously, resort unto the same, and
read the same. The charges of which books shall be ratably borne, between the
Person or approprietary, and the parishioners aforesaid, that is to say, the
one half by the Person or proprietary, and the other half, by the
paryshyoners. And they shall discourage no man (auctorised and licenced
thereto) from the reading of any part of the Bible, either in Latin or in
English: But shall rather conform and exhort every person to read the same,
as ye very lively word of God, and the special food of man's soul, that all
christian persons are bound to embrace, believe, and follow, if they look to
besaued: Whereby they may the better know their duties to God, to their
sovereign lord ye King, and their neighbor, ever gentilly and charitably
exhorting them, and in his Majesty's name, straightly charginge and
commanding them, that in the reading thereof, no man to reason or contend,
but quyetly to hear the reader.

ALSO, the said Ecclesiastical persons, shall in no wise, at any unlawful
time, nor for any other cause, the^ for their honest necessity, hau^te or
resort to any Tauernes, or Alehouses. And after their dynner and supper, they
shall not give the^ selfs to drinckyng or tyot, spe^dyng their time ydely, by
day or by night, at dyse, cards, or tables plaiyng, or any other unlawful
game: But at all times, as they shall have leisure, they shall hear or read
somewhat of holy scripture, or shall occupy the^ selfs with some other honest
exercise, and that they always do the things, which apperteyne to honesty,
with endeavor to profit the common weal, having always in mind, that they
ought to excel all other, in purity of life, and should be example to the
people, to live well and christianly.

ITEM, that they shall in confessions every Lent, examine every person, that
comes to confession to them, whether they ca^ recite the articles of their
Faith, the Pater noster, and the ten commandments in English, and hear
the^ say the same particularly, wherein, if they be not perfect, they shall
declare then, that every christian person, ought to know the said things,
before they should receive the blessed Sacrament of the altar, and monysh
them to learn the said necessary things, more perfitely, or else they ought
not to presume to come to Gods bourde, without perfect knowledge, and will to
observe the same: and if they do, it is to the great periel of their souls, and
also to the worldly rebuke, that they might incur hereafter by the same.

ALSO, that they shall admit no man to preach, within any their cures, but
such as shall appear unto them, to be sufficiently licenced thereunto, by the
Kings Majesty, the lord Protectors grace, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Archbishop of York in his province, or the Bishop of the Dyocesse. And such
as shall be so licenced, they shall gladly receive, to declare the word of God,
without any resistance, or contradiction.

ALSO, if they have heretofore declared to their paryshyoners any thing, to
the extollinge, or setting forth of pilgrimages, relics or images, or
lighting of ca^dels, kissinge, kneling decking of the same images, or any such
supersticion, they shall now openly, before the same, recante, and reprove the
same: showing them (as the truth is) that they did the same upon no ground
of scripture, but were led and seduced by a common error and abuse, crept
into the church, through the sufferaunce and avarice of such, as felt profit
by the same.

ALSO, if they do, or shall know any man within their parish, or else where,
that is a letter of the word of God, to be read in English, or syncerely
preached, or of the execucio^ of these the Kings matesties Iniunccions, or a
fautor of the bishop of Romes pretensed power, now by the laws of this realm,
justly rejected, extirped, and taken away utterly, they shall detecte, and
present the same, to the King or his counsel, or to the justice of peace next
adioyninge.

ALSO, that the Person, Vicar, or Curate, and parishyoners of every paryshe,
within this realm, shall in their Churches and Chapels, keep one book, or
register, wherein they shall write the day and year, of every wedding,
christenynge, and buryall, made within their parish for their time, and so
every man succedynge them likewise: and also therein shall write every persons
name, that shall be so wedded, christened, or buried. And for the saufe keeping of
the same book, ye parish shall be bound to provide of their common charges, one
sure cofer, with two locks and keys, whereof, the one to remain with the
Person, Vicar, or Curate, and the other with the Wardeynes of every parish
Church or Chapel, wherein the said book shall be laid up: which book they
shall every sunday take forth, and in the presence of the said Wardeyns, or
one of them, write and record in the same, all the weddinges, christenynges, and
buryalles, made the whole week before, and that done, to lay up the book in
the said cofer, as before. And for every time, that the same shall be omitted, the
party that shall be in the fault thereof, shall forfaicte to the said
church.iii. s^.iiii. d, to be employed to the poor men's box, of that parish.

FVRTHERMORE, because the goods of the church, are called the goods of ye
pore, and at these days, nothing is less seen, then the pore to be sustained
with the same: al Persons, Vicars, Pencionaries, Prebendaries, and other
beneficed men, within this deanery, not being resident upon their benefices,
which may dispe^de yearly.xx. l. or above, either within this deanery, or else
where, shall distribute hereafter, among their poor parishyoners, or other
inhabitauntes there, in the presence of ye church wardeyns, or some other
honest men of the parish, the fortye part of the fruictes and revenues of
their said benefices, least they be worthily noted of ingratitude, which
reseruinge so many parts to themselfes, cannot vouchesafe, to imparte the
forty portion thereof, among the poor people of that parish, that is so
fruicteful, and profitable unto the^.

AND to the intent, that learned men may hereafter spring the more for the
execucion of the premises, every Person, Vicar, clerk, or beneficed man,
within this deanery, having yearly to dispende in benefices, and other
promocions of the church, an.C. l. shall give co^pete^t exhibicio^ to one
scholar: and for asmany hundred pounds more, as he may dispende, to so many
scholars more, shall give like exhibicion, in the university of Oxford, or
Cambridge, or some gra^mer schole, which after they have proffited in good
learning, may be parteners of their patrones cure and charge, as well in
preaching, as otherwise in the execucion of their offices: or may when need
shall be, otherwise proffite the common weal, with their counsel and wisdom.

ALSO, that all proprietaries, Persons, Vicars, and Clerks, having churches,
chapels or mansions, within this deanery, shall bestow yearly hereafter, upon
the same mansio^s or Chauncelles of their churches, being in decay, the fifth
part of that their benefices, till they be fullye repaired. And the same so
repaired, shall always keep and mainteyne in good estate.

ALSO, that the said Persons, Vicars, and clerks, shall once, every quarter
of the year, read these Iniunccio^s given unto them openly and deliberately,
before all their parishyoners, to the intent, that both they may be the better
admonished of their duetye, and their said parishyoners the more moved, to
follow the same for their part.

ALSO, for as much, as by a law establisshed, every man is bound to pay his
tithes, no man shall by color of duty omitted by their curates, deteigne
their tithes, and so redubbe and requite one wrong with another, or be his
own Judge, but shall truly pay the same, as he has been accustomed, to their
persons, vicars, and curates, without any restrainte or diminucion. And such
lack and default, as they can justly find in their persons and curates, to
call for reformacion thereof, at their ordinaries and other superiors hands,
who, upon complaint, and due proof thereof, shall refourme the same accordingly.

ALSO, that no person shall from hensfurth, altre or change the order and
manner of any fasting day that is commanded, nor of common prayer or divine
service, otherwise then is specified in these Iniunccio^s, until such time as
the same, shall be otherwise ordered and transposed, by the Kings authority.

ALSO, that every Person, Vicar, Curate, Chauntry preeste and stipendarye,
being under the degree of bachilar of Divinity, shall provide, and have of his
own, within three months after this visitacion, the new Testament, both in
Latin and in English, with Paraphrasis upon the same of Erasmus, and diligently
study the same, conferringe the one with the other. And the Bishops, and
other ordynaryes by them selfs. or their officers, in their synodes and
visitacions, shall examyne the said ecclesiastical persons, how they have
proffited in the study of holy scripture.

ALSO, in the time of high mass, within every church, he that says or
sings the same, shall read, or cause to be read, the Epistell and Gospel
of that mass, in English, and not in Latin, in the pulpit, or in such
convenient place, as the people may hear the same. And also every Sunday and
holy day, they shall plainly and distinctely, read, or cause to be read,
one chapter of the new testament in English, in the said place at Matyns,
immediately after the lessons, and at Eue^songe, after Magnificat, one Chapyter
off the old Testament. And to the intent the premises, may be more
conveniently done: The Kings majesty's pleasure is, that when. ix. lessons
should be read in the Church, three of them shall be omitted, and left out with
their respondes. And at Euensonge time, the respondes with all the memories
shall be left of, for that purpose.

ALSO, because those persons, which be sick, and in perel of death, be
oftentimes put in despair, by the craft and subtlety of ye devil, who is
then most busy, and specially with them, that lack the knowledge, sure
persuasion, and steadfast belief, that they may be made partakes of the great
and infinite mercy, which almightye God, of his most bou^tiful goodness, and
mere liberality, without our deserving, has offered freely to all persons,
that puts their full trust and confidence in him: Therefore, that this
damnable vice of despair, may be clearly taken away, and firm belefe, and
steadfast hope, surely conceived of all their parishyoners, being in any
dau^gier, they shall learn, and have always in a redynes, such confortable
places and sentences of scripture, as do setfurth the mercy, benefits and
goodness of almighty God, toward all penitent, and beleuyng persons, that
they may at all times, when necessity shall require, promptly comfort their
flock, with the lively word of God, which is the only stay of man's
conscience.

ALSO, to avoid all contencion and strief, which hertofore has risen, among
the kings Majesty's subjects, in sondrie places of his Realms and dominions,
by reason of fond courtesy, and chalengyng of places in procession, and also
that they may the more quietely, hear that which is said or song, to their
edefiyng: they shall not from hensefurthe, in any parish church, at any time
use any processio^, about the Church or Church yard, or other place, but
immediately before high Mass, the priests with other of the queire, shall
kneel in the mids of the Church, and sing or say, plainly and distinctly,
the Letany, which is setfurthe in English, with all the Suffrages following,
and none other Procession, or Letany to be had or used, but the said Letanie
in English, addyng nothing thereto, but as the kings grace, shall hereafter
appoint: and in Cathedral or Collegiate churches, the same shall be done in such
places, as our Commissaries in our visitacion shall appoynte. And in the time
of the Letanie, of the high Mass, of the Sermon, and when the priest reads
the scripture to the parishioners, no manner of persons, without a just and
urgent cause, shall depart out of the Church: and all ringing and knowlynge of
Belles, shall be utterly forborne for that time, except one Belle, in convenient
time, to be ro^g or knowled before the Sermon.

ALSO, like as the people be commonly occupied on the work day, with bodily
labor, for their bodily sustenaunce: so was the holy day at the first
beginning Godly instituted and ordained, that the people should that day, give
themselfes wholly to God. And whereas in our time, God is more offended then
pleased, more dishonored, then honored, upon the holy day, because of idleness,
pride, drunckennesse, querellyng, and brawlyng, which are most used, in such
days, people nevertheless, perswadinge themselfes, sufficiently to honor God
on that day, if they hear Mass and service, though they understand nothing,
to their edefiynge: therefore all the Kings faithful and loving subjects,
shall from hensefurth celebrate, and keep their holy day, according to Gods
holy will and pleasure, that is: in hearing the word of God read and taught:
in private and public prayers: in knowledging their offenses to God, and
amendment of the same: in reconcilynge their selfs charitably to their
neighbors, where displeasure has been: in often times receiuinge the
communion, of the very body and bloudde of Christ: in visitynge of the poor
and sick: in vsyng all sobernes, and godly conversation, Yet notwithstanding,
all Persons, Vicars, and Curates, shall teach and declare, unto their
parishioners, that they may with a saufe and quiet conscience, in the time of
Harueste, labor upon the holy and festival days, and save that thing which
God has sent. And if for any scrupulositie, or grudge of conscience, men
should supersticiously, abstain from working upon those days, that then they
should grievously offend and displease God.

ALSO, forasmuch as variaunce and contencion, is a thing which most
displeases God, and is most contrary to the blessed communion of the body and
blood of our savior Christ: Curates shall in nowise admit to the receyuinge
thereof, any of their cure and flock, who has maliciously and openly contended
with his neighbor, onles the same do first charitably and openly, reconcile him
self again, remittynge all rancor and malice, whatsoever controversy has
been between them: and nevertheless, their just titles and rightes, they may
charitably, prosecute before such as have authority to hear the same.

ALSO, that every Deane, Archedeacon, Master of Collegiate church, Master of
Hospital, and Prebendary, being Priest, shall preach by himself personally,
twice every year at the least, either in the place, where he is entitled, or
in some Church, where he has iurisdiccion, or else which is to the said place
appropriate, or united,

ALSO, that they shall instruct and teach in their Cures, that no man ought
obstinately, and maliciously, break and violate, the laudable Ceremonies of
the Church, by the king commanded, to be observed, and as yet not abrogated.
And on the otherside, that whosoever does supersticiously abuse them, does the
same to the great periel and daungier of his soul health: as in castinge
holy Water upon his bed, upon Images, and other dedde things, or bearinge
about him holy bread, or saint Ihons Gospel, or making Crosses of woodde
upon Palm Sundaye, in time of readinge of the Passion, or kepinge of private
holy days, as Bakers, Brewers, Smithes, Shoomakers, and such other do, or
ringing of ye holy Belles, or blessing with the holy candel, to the intent,
thereby to be discharged of the burden of sin, or to drive away Deuilles, or
to put away dreams and fantasies, or in puttinge trust and confidence of
health and salvation, in the same Ceremonies: when they be only ordained,
instituted and made, to put us in remembrance of the benefits, which we
have received by Christ. And if he use them for any other purpose, he
grievously offends GOD.

ALSO, that they shall take away, utterly extincte, and destroy, all shrines,
covering of shrines, all tables, candelstickes, tryndilles or rolls of wax,
pictures, paintynges, and all other monumentes of fained miracles, pilgremages,
Idolatry, and supersticio^: so that there remain, no memory of the same, in
walls, glasses, windows, or else where, within their churches or houses. And
they shall exhort all their parishioners, to do the like within their
several houses. And that the Church Wardeynes, at the common charge of the
parishioners in every Church, shall provide a comely and honest pulpitte, to
be set in a convenient place within the same, for the preaching of Gods word.

ALSO, they shall provide, and have within three months after this
visitacion, a strong Cheste, with a hoole in the upper part thereof, to be
provided, at the cost and charge of the parish, having three keys, whereof,
one shall remain in the custody, of the Person, Vycar, or Curate, and the
other two, in the custody of the Church Wardeynes, or any other two honest
men, to be appointed, by the parish, from year to year. Which Cheste, you
shall set and fasten, nere unto the high altar, to the intent, the
Parishioners, should put into it, their Oblacion and almose, for their poor
neighbors. And the Person, Vicar, and Curate, shall diligently, from time to
time, and specially, when men make their Testamentes, call upon, exhort, and
move their neighbors, to confer and give, (as they may well spare) to the
said Cheste: declaring unto them, whereas heretofore they have been
diligente, to bestow much substance, otherwise then GOD commanded, upon
Pardons, Pylgrymages, Trentalles, deckynge of Images, offering of Candelles,
geuyng to Friars, and upon other like blind deuocions, they ought at this time,
to be much more ready to help the poor and nedy, knowing that to releue the
poor, is a true worshipping of God, required earnestly, upon pain of
everlasting dampnacion: and that also, whatsoever is given for their comfort,
is given to Christ him self, and so is accepted of him, that he will
mercifully, reward the same with everlasting life. The which almosse, and
deuocio^ of the people, the kepers of the keys, shall at times convenient,
take out of the Cheste, and distribute the same, in the presence of the whole
parish, or six of them, to be truly and faithefully delivered, to their
most nedy neighbors: and if they be provided for, then to the reparacion of
high ways, next adioynyng. And also the money which rises of fraternities,
guyldes, and other stocks of the Church (except by the Kings Majesty's
authority, it be otherwise appointed) shall be put into the said chest, and
converted to the said use, and also the rentes of lands, the profit of
cattaill, and money given or bequethed, to the findyng of torches, lights,
tapers, and lamps, shall be converted to the said use, saving that it shall be
lawful for them, to bestow part of the said profits, upon the reparacion of
the Church, if great need require, and whereas the Parish is very poor,
and notable otherwise to repair the same.

AND for as much as Priests be public ministers of the Church, and upon the
holy days, ought to apply them selfs, to the common administracion of the
whole parish, they shall not be bound to go to women liynge in child bed,
except in time of dangerous sickness, and not to fetch any corse, before it
be brought to the Church yard: and if the woman be sick, or the corse
brought to the Church, the Priest shall do his duty accordingly, in visityng
the woman, and buriyng the deed person.

ALSO, to avoid the detestable sin of symony, because biyng and sellyng of
benefices, is execrable before God: Therefore, al such persons as bye any
benefices, or come to them by fraud or deceipte, shall be deprived of such
benefices, and be made unable at any time after, to receive any other
spiritual promocio^. And such as do sell them, or by any color do bestow
them, for their own gain and profit, shall lose their right and title of
patronage, and presentement for that time, and the gift thereof for that
vacacion, shall apperte in to the Kings Majesty.

ALSO, because through lack of preachers in many places of the Kings realms
and dominions, the people continue in ignorance and blyndenes: all Persons,
Vicars, and Curates, shall read in their Churches, every Sunday, one of the
Homilies, which are and shall be sethfurthe, for the same purpose, by the Kings
authority, in such sort, as they shall be appointed to do, in the preface of
the same.

ALSO, whereas many indiscrete persons, do at this day, uncharitably
contempne and abuse priests and ministers of the Church, because some of them,
(having small learning) have of long time favored fantasies, rather then
Gods truth: yet for as much, as their office and funccion, is appointed of
God: The Kings Majesty wills and charge, al his loving subjects, that
from hensefurthe, they shall use them charitably and reverently, for their
office and ministracion sake, and especially, all such as labor in the
setting forth of Gods holy word.

ALSO, that all manner of persons, which understand not the Latin toungue,
shall pray upon none other Primer, but upon that, which was lately setfurth in
English, by authority of King Henry the.VIII. of most famous memory. And
that no teacher of youth, shall teach any other, then the said Prymer. And
all those, which have knowledge of the latin toungue, shall pray upon none
other latin Primer, but upon that, which is likewise setfurthe by the said
authority. And that all graces to be said at dinner and supper, shall be
always said in the English toungue. And that none other Grammar, shall be
taught in any School or other place, within the Kings realms and dominions,
but only that which is set forth by the said authority.

ITEM, that all Chauntrie Priests, shall exercise them selfs, in teaching
youth to read and write, and bringyng them up in good manners, and other
virtuous exercises.

ITEM, when any Sermon or Homilye shall be had, the Pryme and Hours shall be
omitted.

The form of biddyng the common prayers.
YOU shall pray for the whole congregation of Christ's Church, and
specially, for this Church of England and Irelande: wherein, first, I
commend to your devout prayers, the kings most excellent Majesty, supreme
head ymmediately under GOD, of the spiritualtye and temporaltie of the same
Church: And for Queen Katharine dowag^^r, and also for my lady Mary, and my
lady Elizabeth, the Kings susters.

SECONDLY you shall pray for my lord Protectors grace, with all the rest of
