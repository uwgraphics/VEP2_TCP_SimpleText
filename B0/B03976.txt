Englands Sorrow For the Death of his late Majesty King CHARLES the II. Of
Blessed Memory.
UNsluce your Tears for Shame: what can you keep
Your Eyes within their Sockets, and not Weep?
Have we a Jewel lost, more worth by far
Than Africa and both the Indies are?
And can you stop the Current of your Tears,
And not Beflood your selves over Head and Ears?
O Fie! fall down before his holy Shrine,
And weep as fast as ever it did Rain,
Stamp, and with Tears inundate all your Cheeks,
And split his very Marble-stone with Streeks;
For we have lost that lovely Silver Dove,
Which was a Pledge of God Almighty's Love:
It Is Flown away; and left its Corporal Arc,
(Until the Resurrection) in the Dark:
Our splended Sun is Set, and gone away,
And never will Rise again till Judgment Day:
The Meekest, Sweetest, and the Best of Kings,
Is mounted on a pair of Angels Wings;
And by a Summon sent from God) is gone
To set upon the Everlasting Throne:
O! that I might (if it but Lawful were)
Whisper with Reverence at his Sacred Ear,
And ask if he in earnest had his Breath
Stopped by the Handkerchief of Saucy Death;
I cannot believe it was; sure it is a Lie.
The Elect shall only Changed be, not Die:
And he I Am confident was one of those
Who being almost free from Sin was Chose:
And so he did not Die as some Report,
But went a Live to the Celestial Court;
There to receive (stead of a fading Crown)
One that I Am sure will never Tumble Down.
Therefore (when we perpend his Happiness,
If we do Mourn) we ought to Mourn the less:
For (tho fond Nature bids us Weep a while,
When we consider that) we ought to Smile.
Truly (to Mourn no more) I hold it Best;
Come draw his Curtains close, and let him Rest:
Tho he is gone, yet he has left ins stead
The Bravest Prince that ever wore a Head:
Long may he Live to wear the Crown and Flourish,
Till all his Enemies Fret, Pine and Perish.
