A Warning for all (...)
By the example of Richard Whitfield, and M. Gibs who were two notorious
offenders, and both of one company, which two men made a daily practice, and
got their livings by robbing and stealing both on the Highways, and in any
other places where they came, but were at last taken, apprehended and condemned
to dye for robing of a Coach, and murdering of a Captains man at Shooters-Hil,
in Kent, some five or sin miles from London, and for that offense and others,
Gibs was pressed to death at Maidstone in Kent, and Whitfield was hanged in
chains on Shooters-Hil, where he did the bloody deed, the 27th. of March, 1655.
The manner how shall be exactly related in this Ditty.

The Tune is, Ned Smith.


OF two notorious Thieves,
my purpose is to tell,
Which near fair London Town
long time did live and dwell.
One of their names was Gibs,
a Villain vile and base
The other Dick Whitfield called,
who ran a wicked race,
To rob to theeve and steal,
these couple gave their mind,
And unto murder men,
they daily were inclined,
So stout and bold they were
that they durst fight with ten,
And rob them on the way
though they were lusty men,
Sometimes they would disguise.
themselves in strange attire,
And to do mischief still,
Was all they did desire.
Sometimes about the fields
they would walk in the night
And use much cruelty
to them that they did meet.
A man could hardly pass.
the fields at ten a clock,
But they would be sure to have,
the cloak from off his back.
Or if he had no cloak
they would his money take,
Of what they went about
they did no conscience make.
If they with women met
when it was in the night
they would strip off their clothes
and leave them naked quite.
Such unhumanity
betwixt them did remain
That by their bloody hands
good Christians have been slain
(...) (...) robberies
these bloody villains did,
But theft and murder both,
long time will not lie hid.
Sometimes they have been caught
and unto Newgate sent,
Yet they had mercy shown
because they should repent.
But though the Judges often
took pity on those men,
As soon as they got loose
they would fall to it again,
But now behold and see
that happened at the last,
(...) they had escaped through much
(...) many dangers past.

He asked them what they were,
quoth they, we money crave,
Money we are come for
and money we must have.
Their Pistols being fixed.
their bullets they let fly
The Captain drew his sword
and fought courageously.
And in that dangerous fight
the Captains man was slain
And then they robbed the rest
that did in the Coach remain.
And for their bloody deeds
and for that robbery
They after taken were
and suffered certainly.
At Maidstone town in Kent
there Gibs was pressed to death,
and Whitfield hangs in chains
at Shooters-Hill near Black Heath
Let other wicked men,
high and low, great and small
Remember and take heed
by Gibs and Whitfields fall.
