Loves tyrannick conquest.
Love and Beauty have such power
Sometimes joys they do devour
And those that of their power are tasting
Sighing daily still are wasting.
Tune of, Blush no redder than the morning.




^ CUPID, leave thy Tyranizing; Thou art still new pains devising, Pains too
great to be Endured,
^Past all hopes for to be Cured. Pains too great to be endured, Past all hopes
for to be cured
Take some pity of my anguish
Mind but how I sigh and languish,
It Is your frowns my ruin tell me
And what fate by Love befell me,
It Is your frowns my ruin tell me,
And what fate by love befell me.
'Twas the charms of conquering beauty
That compelled me to this duty,
Which so strangely does enslave me
That of sense it does bereave me,
Which so strangely does enslave me
That of sense it does bereave mea.




It Is a most exceeding pity
You should be so fair and pretty
Yet so cruel to undo me
And not send one smile unto me
Yet so cruel to undo me,
And not send one smile unto me.
Here I perish with desire
^urning in an endless fire
Sighing like one discontented
Unregarded, Unlamented.
Sighing like one discontented,
Unregarded, unlamented.
Could I tell thee how I love thee
And respect thee none above thee
Thou would count my tongue too lavish
So with charms my heart to ravish,
Thou would count my tongue too lavish
So with charms thy heart to ravish.
Never was a soul so wounded
Or a reason so confounded
As to cover its own ruin
Hugging what is its undoing
As to covet its own ruin,
Hugging what is its undoing.
But alas it sore does grieve me
That mine eyes should so deceive me
Thus to bring me to a Fetter
Love's a Chain, and it is no better
Thus to bring me to a Fetter,
Love's a chain, and it is no better.
You that are with joys surrounded
Pity me with love so wounded
That I know not how to ease me
Nothing else but death can please me.
That I know not how to ease me,
Nothing else but death can please me.
When the Nymph heard him complaining
Of his passion strongly reigning
She was moved with grief to hear him
And resolved to get near him,
She was moved with grief to hear him
And resolved to get near him.
With a sigh and mournful wishes
She bestowed on him some kisses
mourn no more quoth she, for ever
Thee to please I will endeavor
Mourn no more quoth she for ever
Thee to please I will endeavor.
She of whom thou stood'st in fear on
Now will prove thy only dear one
In my arms I will embrace thee
In my bosom I will place thee
in my arms I will embrace thee
in my bosom etc.
It wounds my soul that I should grieve thee
Now I vow I never will leave thee
Then my dearest do not doubt me
For I cannot live without thee
then my dearest do not doubt me
for I cannot live without thee.
