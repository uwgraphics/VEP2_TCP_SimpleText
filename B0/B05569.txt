A PROCLAMATION, Discharging persons to go off the Country.
At Edinburgh, the 3d of August, 1689.
THE Lords of Privy Council, in pursuance of His Majesty's Commands, contained
in His Letter, directed to them, of the Date the 26. day of July last,
signifying how prejudicial it may be to this Kingdom, and inconvenient for His
Majesty's Service, that such of His Subjects after-mentioned, should depart
forth of the Country at this time, when the prospect of a Foreign Invasion,
joined with a present Rebellion, does so much Threaten the Disturbance of the
Peace thereof: Therefore by Warrant of, and in His Majesty's Name and
Authority, They strictly Prohibit and Discharge, all Members of His Majesty's
Privy Council, and Officers of the Army, or any who are otherwise Employed in
Public Trust, to withdraw themselves from this Kingdom, without special Leave
obtained from His Majesty, upon any pretense whatsomever, as they will be
answerable at their highest peril. And Ordains these Presents to be Printed,
and Published at the Mercat Cross of Edinburgh, and other places needsul, by
the Macers of Privy Council. Extracted by me
