The Naked-Truth: OR, A New Song without a Lie
Tune of, Old Simon the King: Or, The Character of sundry Trades and Callings.




Though Trading we find in the City,
and many more places, is bad,
Yet here I will sing a fine Ditty,
we'd as good he merry as sad:
Of several Trades I will treat,
and will with the Butcher begin,
With what kind of Trade shall he meet,
if he has neither Careass nor Skin;
All you that are now in this Throng,
I reckon to do you no wrong,
Believe me, I pray, by yea and by nay,
there is not a lie in this Song.
A Weaver without Loom or Shuttle,
like one out of use, may lie by,
A Tinker without any Metal,
no woman will ever employ:
A Cobbler without St. Hugh's bones,
he cannot mend Old, or make New,
A Pavier without any Stones.
Oh, what is he able to do?
All you that are now in this Throng, etc.
A Man that is quite Moneyless,
through Crowds he in safety may pass,
A Cook that has no meet to Dress,
he need not stand making of Sauce.
A Tailor without over a Yard,
his bodkin, goose, thimble and sheers,
You Will find that he is as much Marred,
as if he had lost both his Ears:
All you that are now, etc.
A Fisherman without a Net,
you know he can catch but a few,
But yet his good wife she will fret,
when ever she wants of her due:
The jolly brisk Baker is one,
to whom the young Lasses do troule,
So that he so clearly undone,
if he had not a Rusling-Pole:
All you that are now, etc.
The Miller's for taking to task,
the Mistress or Gillian the Maid,
The Cooper without Hoops or Cask,
he cannot well follow his Trade:
The Poet without e're a Muse,
can never make Sonnets complete,
A Footman without Pumps or Shoes,
will certainly blister his feet:
All you that are now, etc.
A Scrivener without Ink or Pen,
his hands and his Letters cannot write,
A Captain that lost all his men,
will have but small stomach to fight:
The man that shall marry for Gold,
and brings home a Shrew to his bed,
Both Morning, Noon, Night she will scold
and still have a Foise in her head,
All you that are now, etc.
The Chimney-Sweeper pray don't sco^,
for if he has Shackles and Poles,
He Will call to the Maids each-morn,
to scour and cleanse their black holes:
That man that is naked indeed,
he is not like Tailors, and those,
For though he has never so much need,
he is not for pawning his Clothes:
All you that are now, etc.
A Gallant that has a good Coat,
'twill help him out at a dead lift,
A Sculler that has never a boat,
he fears not Running a Drift:
Some Sharpers a Calling does use,
it is Robbing Rich Men of their store,
But he that has nothing to loose,
he needs not a watch at his door.
All you that are now, etc.
I never was brought up for to Lie,
and therefore I tell you the truth,
My ballads I Would have you to buy,
they are fit for Diversion of Youth:
My Pocket with Cole to increase,
let every young man and maid,
Now lay out a penny a piece,
and then I shall have a good trade.
All you that are now in this Throng,
I Will do you no manner of wrong,
Believe me, I pray, by yea and by nay,
there is not a lie in this Song.
FINIS.
