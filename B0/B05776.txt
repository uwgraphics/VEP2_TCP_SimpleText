The Second Part of the new Scotch-Jigg: OR, JENNY'S Reply, To JOHNNY'S Cravat.
The Case ^s altered now; Jenny Wooes Johnny
To tie her Kirtle, and she will be his Honey;
Which Johnny took so kindly sitting by her,
That for his heart, he could not well deny her,
At length they did agree, so plain and pat,
That he her Kirtle tied; She his Cravat.
Tune of, Jenny come tie my, etc.


AS Jenny sat under a Siccomore Tree
She spied her love Johnny come over the Lee;
O welcome my Johnny! now welcome my dear!
I (...) my honey, come sit thee down here.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
(...)thy my Johnny, never doubt of my Love;
(...) I am constrained by Cupid above,
(...) love thee so dear, as the blood in my heart;
(...) not thou fear, that we ever will part.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
O Johnny, my honey, thou know;st it is true
How scornful thou was when I did thee first woe,
And when I begged of thee to tie my Cravat;
You said, that I wanted a bit for my Cat.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny came tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
My Johnny, I love the as dear as my Life,
And could be contented for to be thy Wife,
Although I was fickle, and seemed to be Coy:
Yet now I Will be constant, my Love and my joy.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.


But Jenny, if that I thy Kirtle should tie,
Come well me my Honey, and tell me no lie;
If thou will be willing my Love to requite,
O Johnny I Will please thee by day, and by night.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay,
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
I Will buy for my Love, a Cravat that is new,
If thou will be constant, and ever be true;
And ty't with a Ribbond of Papinjay green,
The like in the Parish there shall not be seen.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
But Johnny now tell me, if that I consent,
Shall I never have any cause to repent?
To gain a bad Bargain, may make me to rue;
Then prithee resolve to be faithful and true.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
As true as the Steel I Am resolved to be;
And all that I have, is my Johnny, for thee;
Thou kens, that my Portion I have for to take,
And now I have kept it so long for thy sake.
Johnny come tie my Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay,
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet if thou will love me, i will tie it again.
My Jenny, I joy for to see thee so kind
To tell thee my love, it rejoices my mind;
Thy lokks are so Bonny and blithe, for to see;
Of all the brave Lasses, my Jenny for me.
Johnny come tie me, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain.
Yet if thou will love me, I Will tie it again;
O Johnny! I swear by the Lace of my Gown,
I love thee above the Lads in the Town:
And for to gang with thee, what ever befall;
I Will leave both my Daddy, and Mammy, and all,
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
Yet now if thou will love me, I Will tie it again.
My Jenny, I Am willing thy Kirtle to tie,
Since thou art so loving, I cannot deny:
And ever hereafter my own thou shall be;
Then prithee my Honey, be loving to me.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
But since do thou love me, I Will tie it again.
Now Johnny, since I ken what you would be at,
I likewise am willing to tie thy Cravat:
And by this same Kiss; I will ever be true;
My Johnny shall never have cause for to rue.
Johnny come tie my, Johnny come tie my,
Johnny come tie my Kirtle so gay.
I Have tied it so often, and tied it in vain;
But now I will tie it again and again.
