The ANTI-CURSE.
CUrs't be the Stars which did ordain,
That Whigs in England ever should reign,
Who by their damned rebellious brood,
Laid the Three Kingdoms all in Blood;
Curs't be the Tribe, yea doubly curs't
Be those that Murdered Charles the First,
And may their Names recorded be
In Hell to all Posterity.
Curs't be the Tribe who would have done
The same to Charles the Martyr's Son;
But Curs't of all the Race be those,
Who basely did King James depose:
Under pretense to set us free,
They sold us unto Slavery.
Curs't be those Rebellious Knaves,
To free themselves would make us Slaves;
Curs't be that Rebel Delamere,
Who with the Rabble did appear,
When first the Invasion was begun,
Against the Father by the Son,
Curs't be th'ungratefull Churchill, who
Betrayed his King and Master too.
Let us with one accord agree,
To set our King and Country free,
From this accursed Tyranny,
Which by unnatural Usurpation,
Beggars us for the good of the Nation,
Which is to Swear with mental Reservation.
For sure he never could intend,
The Church of England to defend,
When Prelates he left in the Lurch,
And set the Kirk above the Church;
Unless he thought that Prelacy,
The Common Prayer and Liturgy,
Were all the Church's Enemy.
Curs't be the Name of English Man,
To Curse it more Live William.
Then we completely shall be Curs't,
For of all Cursings he is the worst.
How to Curse more I cannot tell,
In him are all the Plagues of Hell,
God bless King James, and so farewell.
