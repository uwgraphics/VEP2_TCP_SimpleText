The COUNTRY Lawyers Maid JOAN, Containing her Languishing Lamentation for want
of a Man, which at length she met with, being her Masters Man Mark.
Tune of Turn Coat of the Times.
Licensed according to Order.







YOu Batchelors all attend,
And stand a poor Maidens Friend,
My Sorrows to you I send,
In order to let you know
My passionate grief and woe,
And what I do undergo:
In languishing sort I lie,
Here ready to sigh and dye,
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
There Is my young Sister Kate,
She Is Married I hear of late
Unto a young Sparkish Mate;
But I poor honest Joan,
Must languish and lie alone,
Not any regards my moan:
In sorrowful sort I cry,
Here ready with grief to dye,
What pain I endure for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
I Think I have Beauty bright,
Young Batchelors to delight,
I wonder that they should slight
Such amorous Charms as mine,
And suffer me to repine,
My Life I shall soon resign:
For languishing here I lie,
O ready this Day to dye,
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
I commonly do repair
To every Wake and Fair,
Dressed up in my Powdered Hair,
My Beauty still to adorn,
And yet I am held in scorn,
Ah! would I had never been born,
For languishing here I lie,
And ready this Day to dye,
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
Young Robin the Millers Son,
When he had my Favor won,
He did to another run;
Thus hurried me to Despair,
As knowing the gri^f and care
Was greater than I could bear,
For languishing did I lie,
I Will tell ye dear Friends, for why?
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
Were husbands to be sold,
And I had as much bright Gold,
As ever my Lap could hold;
Nay, if I had ten times more,
I Would freely part with that store,
I tell you dear Friends, before
I languishing thus would lie,
A husband, in troth, I Would buy,
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
A Husband I dearly lack,
Though he be a Collier black,
Or Pedlar with his Pack,
That travels the Nation wide,
It Is all one to me, she cried,
I Would willingly be a Bride:
For languishing here I lie,
Nay ready this Day to dye,
The Grief I sustain, for want of a Man,
There Is no body knows but I.
At length came lusty Mark,
A Country Lawyers Clark,
And tickled her in the dark;
He litt on the very Vein,
The place of her grief and pain,
And caused her to laugh amain and
And merrily did reply,
O this is the Death I Would dye,
What Grief I endured for want of a Man,
There Is no body knew but I.
