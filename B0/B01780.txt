WHen the sweet Poison of the Treacherous Grape,
Had Acted on the world a General Rape;
Drowning our very Reason and our Souls
In such deep Seas of large o'reflowing Bowls,
That New Philosophers Swore they could feel
The Earth to Stagger, as her Sons did Reel:
When Foggy Ale, leavying up mighty Trains
Of muddy Vapors, had besieged our Brains;
And Drink, Rebellion, and Religion too,
Made Men so Mad, they knew not what to do;
Then Heaven in Pity, to Effect our Cure,
And stop the Ragings of that Calenture,
First sent amongst us this All-healing-Berry,
At once to make us both Sober and Merry.
Arabian Coffee, a Rich Cordial
To Purse and Person Beneficial,
Which of so many Virtues does partake,
Its Country's called Felix for its sake.
From the Rich Chambers of the Rising Sun,
Where (...), and all good Fashions (...) beg^n,
Where Earth with Choicest Rarities is blessed,
And dying Phoenix builds Her wondrous Nest:
COFFEE arrives, that Grave and wholesome Liquor,
That heals the Stomach, makes the Genius quicker,
Relieve, the Memory, Revives the Sad,
And chears the Spirits, without making Mad;
For being of a Cleansing QUALITY,
By NATURE warm, Attenuating and Dry,
Its constant Use the sullenest Griefs will Rout,
Removes the Dropsy, gives ease to the Gout,
And soon dispatcheth wheresoever it finds
Scorbutic Humors, Hypochondriack winds,
Rheums, Ptisicks, Palsies, Jaundise, Coughs, Catarrhs,
And whatsoever with Nature leavyeth Wars;
It helps Digestion, want of Appetite,
And quickly sets Consumptive Bodies Right;
A Friendly Intercourse it does Maintain,
Between the Heart, the Liver, and the Brain,
Natures three chiefest Wheels, whose Jars we know,
Threaten the whole Microcosme with overthrow;
In Spring, when Peccant Humors Increase most,
And Summer, when the Appetite is lost,
In Autumn, when Raw Fruits Diseases Breed,
And VVinter time too cold to Purge or Bleed;
Do but this Rare ARABIAN Cordial Use,
And thou may all the Doctors Slops Refuse.
Hush then, dull QUACKS, your Mountebanking cease,
COFFEE's a speedier Cure for each Disease;
How great its Virtues are, we hence may think,
The Worlds third Part makes it their common Drink;
The Amourous Gallant, whose hot Reins do fail,
Stung by Conjunction with the Dragons-Tail:
Let him but Tipple here, shall find his Grief
Discharged, without the Sweting-Tubs Relief;
Nor have the LADIES Reason to Complain,
As fumbling Doe-littles are apt to Faign;
COFFEE's no Foe to their obliging Trade,
By it Men rather are more Active made;
It Is stronger Drink, and base adulterate Wine,
Enfeebles Vigor, and makes Nature Pine;
Laden with which, the Impotent Sott is Led
Like a Sowc'd Hogshead to a Misses Bed;
But this Rare Settle-Brain prevents those Harms,
Conquers Old Sherry, and brisk Clarret Charms.
Sack, I defy thee with an open Throat,
Whilst Trusty COFFEE is my Antedote;
Methinks I hear Poets Repent they have been,
So long Idolaters to that sparkling Queen;
For well they may perceive it is on Her score
APOLLO keeps them all so Cursed Poor;
Let them avoid Her tempting Charms, and then
We hope to see the Wits grow Aldermen;
In Brieif, all you who Healths Rich Treasures Prize,
And Court not Ruby Noses, or blear'd Eyes,
But own Sobriety to be your Drift,
And Love at once good Company and Thrist;
To Wine no more make Wit and Coin a Trophy,
But come each Night and Frollique here in Coffee.
The RULES and ORDERS of the COFFEE-HOUSE.
Enter Sirs freely, But first if you please,
Peruse our Civil-Orders, which are these.
FIrst, Gentry, Tradesmen, all are welcome hither,
And may without Affront sit down Together:
Pre-eminence of Place, none here should Mind,
But take the next fit Seat that he can find:
Nor need any, if Finer Persons come,
Rise up for to assign to them his Room;
To limit Men's Expense, we think not fair,
But let him forfeit Twelve-pence that shall Swear:
He that shall any Quarrel here begin,
Shall give each Man a Dish to Atone the Sin;
And so shall He, whose Complements extend
So far to drink in COFFEE to his Friend;
Let Noise of loud Disputes be quite forborne,
No Maudlin Lovers here in Corners Mourn,
But all be Brisk, and Talk, but not too much
On Sacred things, Let none presume to touch,
Nor Profane Scripture, or sawcily wrong
Affairs of State with an Irreverent Tongue:
Let Mirth be Innocent, and each Man see,
That all his Jests without Reflection be;
To keep the House more Quiet, and from Blame,
We Banish hence Cards, Dice, and every Game:
Nor can allow of VVagers, that Exceed
Five shillings, which oft-times much Trouble Breed;
Let all that is lost, or forfeited, be spent
In such Good Liquor as the House does Vent,
And Customers endeavor to their Powers,
For to observe still seasonable Hours.
Lastly, Let each Man what he calls for Pay,
And so you're welcome to come every Day.
