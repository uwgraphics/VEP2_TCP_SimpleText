Good Ale for my money.
The Good-fellowes resolution of strong Ale,
That cures his nose from looking pale.
To the tune of, The Country Less.




BE merry my friends, and list a while
unto a merry jest,
It may from you produce a smile,
when you hear it expressed.
Of a young man lately married,
which was a boon good fellow,
This song in's head he always carried,
when drink had made him mellow,
I cannot go home, nor I will not go home,
its long of the oil of Barley:
I Will tarry all night for my delight,
and go home in the morning early,
No Tapster stout, or Vintner fine,
quoth he shall ever get
One groat out of this purse of mine
to pay his masters debt:
Why should I deal with sharking Rookes,
that seek poor gulls to cozen,
To give twelve pence for a quart of wine,
of ale twill buy a dozen.
Twill make me sing, I cannot etc.
The old renowned Ipocrist
and Raspie does excel,
But never any wine could yet
my honor please to swell.
The Rhenish wine or Muskadine,
sweet Malmsie is too fulsome,
No give me a cup of Barlie broth,
for that is very wholesome,
Twill make me sing, I cannot etc.
Hot waters ar to me as death,
and soon the head oreturneth,
And Nectar has so strong a breath
Canary when it burns,
It cures no pain but breaks the brain,
and raps out oaths and curses,
And makes men part with heavy heart,
but light it makes their purses,
I cannot go home, etc
Some say Metheglin bears the name,
with Perry and sweet Sider
Twill bring the body out of frame.
and reach the belly wider:
Which to prevent I am content
with ale that's good and nappie.
And when thereof I have enough.
I think my self most happy.
I cannot go home, etc.
All sorts of men when they do meet
both trade and occupation,
With courtesy each other greet,
and kind humiliation:
A good coal fire is their desire,
whereby to sit and parley,
They Will drink their ale and tell a tale,
and go home in the morning early.
I cannot go home, etc.
Your domineering swaggering blades,
and Caualiers that flas^es,
That throw the Iugs against the walls,
and break in pieces glasses,
When Bacchus round cannot be found
they will in merriment
Drink ale and beer and cast of care,
and sing with one consent.
I cannot go home, etc.
The second part.
To the same tune,




HEre honest ^ohn, to thee I Will drink,
and so to Will and Thomas,
None of this company I think,
will this night part from us:
While we are here we will join for beer
like lively lads together,
We have a house over our heads,
a fig for ranie weather.
I cannon go home, nor will not go home,
its long of the oil of barley,
I stay all night for my delight.
and go home in the morning early.
Here Is Smug the smith and Ned the Cook,
and Frank the fine felt-maker.
Here Is Steven with his silver hook,
and Wat the lusty baker:
Here Is Harry and Dick, with Greg and Nicke,
here is Timothy the Tailor,
Here Is honest ^it, nere spoke of yet,
and George the iouiall Sayler.
That cannot etc.
We Will sit and bouse and merrily chat,
and freely we will join
For care near paid a pound of debt,
nor shall pay none of mine:
Here is but eighteen pence to pay,
since every man is willing,
Bring drink with all the speed you may,
we will make it up two shillings.
We cannot etc.
Let Father frown, and Mother chide,
and Uncle seek to find us,
Here is good lap here will we bide
weel leave no drink behind us,
A prouerhe old I have heard told,
by my dear dad and grandsire,
He was hanged that left his drink behind
therefore this is our answer,
We cannot etc.
James the Ioyner he has paid,
and Anthony the Glouer,
Our hostess has a pretty maid,
I cannot choose but love her:
Her pot she will fill, with right good will,
here is ale as brown as a berry,
Twill make an old woman dance for joy,
and an old man's heart full merry
I cannot etc.
Twill make a Soldier domineere,
and bravely draw his rapier,
Su^^vertue does remain in beer
twill make a Cripple caper:
Women with men, will now and then
sit round and drink a little,
Tom Tinkers wife on Friday night
for drink did pawn her kettle,
She could not come home, nor would not come home
her belly began to rumble,
She had no power to go nor stand,
but about the street did tumble.
Thus to conclude my verses rude,
would some good fellows here
Would join together pence a piece
to buy the singer beer:
I trust none of this company
will be herewith offended,
Therefore call for your jugs a piece
and drink to him that pend it.
