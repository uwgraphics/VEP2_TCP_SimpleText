The Kind believing Hostess.
I owe my Hostess money,
She takes me for her debtor,
On the buttery door
Stands my Score,
The further on the better.
To the tune of, When Willy once had strayed.


I Have an Hostess pretty.
exceeding fair and witty,
Where she does dwell
I shall you tell
If you will list to my ditty.
I owe my Hostess money,
she takes me for her Debtor:
on the buttery door
stands my Score,
the further on the better.
Near London is her dwelling,
To trust me she is willing,
Her pots are small,
And little withal,
But I will look to her filling.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
To me she bears affection,
And calls me her own complexion,
Her husband John
Poor silly old man,
She keeps under subjection.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
To speak poor man he dares not,
My Hostess for him cares not,
She Will drink and quaffe,
And merrily laugh,
And she his anger fears not.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
All night she will sit smoking,
For roaring gallants looking:
And those which stay,
Are sure to pay,
I do not like such rooking,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
Tobacco and hot waters,
And female rooking Cheaters,
Are bravely dressed,
But I protest,
I hate such sharking Creatures.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
She keeps both Besse and Dolly,
Brave wenches stout and Jolly,
But I Will have a care
Of them to beware,
I know they are given to folly.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
Thei'le trade with Dutch and Danish
The French and lustful Spanish,
But when the whores
Come in a doors,
Away I bid them vanish.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
I Am sure they shall not cheat me.
I care not though they hate me,
Like Crocodiles,
Their tears and smiles
Shall not a fool create me.
I owe my Hostess money
She takes me for her debtor,
On the buttery door
Stands my Score,
The further on the better.
The second part
To the same tune.


THe truth for to speak rightly,
They get their money lightly,
By lustful sin,
Comes Iyngling in.
Unto them day and nightly.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
There Is swaggering Nathaniel
With roaring lack and Daniel,
For their delight.
That loves to keep,
A Hawke, a Horse, a Spaniel,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
There Is swearing Sim and Sanders,
Are new come ore from Flanders,
That swears and roares
And beats the Whores.
Yet never were commanders.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
You may have for your money,
A Rabit or young Coney,
Most dainty words,
Her love affords,
She Will call you her own sweet hunny,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
If you on the sport be eager,
And that you will not swagger,
Kind Genlemen
You need not then,
Go unto Hollands Leaguer.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
For Wenches she can get ye
And of all sorts can fit ye,
Most bravely clad,
As may be had,
If leisure but permit ye,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
A Girl attired in Satin,
Can speak both French and Latin,
If you have gold
You may be bold,
And have a five room to chat in.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
A Country Less that's pretty,
Or one fetched from the City,
Or for your sport,
One tall or short,
A handsome Wench that's witty,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
If so believing am ye,
As for the rest O damme ye,
But will be kind
Unto your mind
The Whores will finely flam ye,
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
By others harms be warned,
With wisdoms eye discern it.
And have a care
You come not there,
From them the French to learn it.
I owe my Hostess money, etc.
With honey words I will screw her,
And many a fine trick show her,
I Will keep me away,
When she is to pay.
Her Baker and her Brewer.
I owe my Hostess money,
She takes me for her debtor:
and looks for the day
when her I should pay,
the more it is still the better.
FINIS.
