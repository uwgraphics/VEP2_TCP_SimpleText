THE Suffering LOVER: OR, Fair FLORAMELLA's Melting Petition TO HER Dear
PHILANDER.
To an excellent new Tune. Licensed according to Order.
IN the deserts of Greenland,
where the sun never cast an eye,
Blessed with thee, my dear Philander,
I could choose to live and dye:
No nymph with her fly subtle art,
Ever shall have power to steal my heart,
Thou art all in all in every part,
Each vein of me, shall ever be
Panting for love of thee.
On the sands of scorch't Africa,
where the sun-burn'd natives fry,
Blessed with thee, my dear Philander,
I could choose to live and dye:
No swain with his aid, wit, or art,
Ever shall have power to storm my heart,
Thou art all in all in every part,
Each vein of me, shall ever be
Panting for love of me.
In deserts of Arabia,
from which place all creatures fly,
Blessed with thee, my dear Philander,
I could choose to live and dye:
Such pleasures I with thee should find,
That would ease the anguish of my mind,
For to none but thee will I ever be kind,
Each vein of me, shall ever be
Panting for love of thee.
Through the greatest of danger,
I would venture with my dear,
And my heart should be a stranger,
to the sad effects of fear:
If on the raging ocean sea,
Thou would then my skilful pilot be,
Therefore through the world I Would wander with thee,
Each vein of me, shall every be
Panting for love of thee.
No joys are worth possessing,
through the universe below,
Should I be denied the blessing,
of my dear Philander, though
I might enjoy a diadem,
And in golden streams of pleasure swim,
I would slight them all in respect of him,
Whom evermore, I will adore,
He has my heart in store.
Fly to thy Floramella,
for to cheer her drooping heart;
Should I wear the wreath willow,
'Twould be like a fatal dart:
Then dear Philander come away,
I long to see the delightful day,
Which will crown our joy with innocent play,
Each vein of me, shall ever be
Panting for love of thee.
Let me never be slighted
for the love which I bear,
Least my wrongs they should be righted,
by your languishing despair;
For should you kill me with disdain,
Then tears and sorrow would be in vain,
A lost life they cannot recover again,
The veins in me, shall ever be
Panting for love of thee.
FINIS.
