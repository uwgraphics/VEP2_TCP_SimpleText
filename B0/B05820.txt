Shall I? shall I? No, No.
A wanton Lad and comely Lass
did once together meet;
Tho she seemed coy her heart he won
with Complements most sweet.
Tune of, The doubting Virgin.




PRetty Betty now come to me,
thou have set my Heart on fire,
Thy denial will undo me,
grant me then what I desire:
Prithee try me, don't deny me
lest it prove my overthrow,
Never dally, shall I? shall I?
still she answered, no, no, no.
In the Fields they went a walking,
he this Maid did sweetly court,
But the subject of his talking
rended still to Venus sport:
He persuaded, she delayed it,
and would not be deluded so;
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
but she answered No no no.
He bestowed on her sweet kisses,
hoping thereby to obtain
and to taste true Lovers blisses,
Which he long time sought in vain
With sighs, and sobs and deadly throbs,
he strove the Damzels mind to know
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
still she answered No no no.
To the Tavern then he took her,
feasting her with costly Wine;
In the Face did often look her,
swearing that she was divine:
She told the Youth it was untruth,
I would not have you flatter so:
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
but she answered No no no.


With fair Words he did entreat her
to him for to condescend;
As his passion waxed greater
he her Beauty did commend:
She denied it and defied it,
vowing it should never be so;
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
but she answered No no no.
Thus he spent his time in Wooing
but found no encouragement,
His fingers itch'd for to be doing,
and she perceived his intent;
She still at trial gave denial;
but Maidens often times do so:
Come let us dally, shll I? shall I?
but she answered No no no.
He continued still to woo her;
but she made him this Reply:
That his aim was to undo her,
and would know his reason why.
He protested that she jested,
his design was nothing so;
Come lets dally, shall I? shall I?
but she answered No no no.
But on hopes the Youngster builded,
hoping she at last would yield;
And at lenght the Damzel yielded,
with his Charms he won the field:
In the shade down her he laid,
he himself lay smiling by;
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
then she answered Ay, ay, ay.
Then they fell to sweet embraces,
Lovers you know what I mean,
So close did join their blushing faces
you could not put a straw between,
In amorous chains there he remains
till he for breath did panting lie;
Come let us dally, shall I? shall I?
then she answered Ay ay ay.
She who stoutly first denied him,
by his Complements was won;
And she vowed when she had cried him
that the job was neatly done.
Maids beware, and have a care
of flattering youths, who often do try,
And will dally, Shall I? Shall I?
till you cry out Ay ay ay.
Printed for P. Brooksby at the Harp etc ball in Pie Corner.
