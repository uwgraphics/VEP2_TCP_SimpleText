The Loyal Subject Resolution,
Who in Defense of his King will Fight
For to Maintain his Countries Right;
Inviting all his fellow peers
To List themselves for Volunteeres.
To the Tune of, Turn Love.


BRave English boys come follow me,
And I will lead the Van,
My heart is bent courageously
To venture stoutly on:
I hate the thoughts of Cowardice,
Or such a dirty thing,
I Will to the Wars go Volunteere
In service for the King.
The Netherlanders make their boast
In a pr^sumptuous manner,
To rove upon our English Coast
And rob us of our Honor:
But of stouted hearted London Lads,
a party I will bring,
I Will to the Wars etc.
A gallant Fleet is setting out
Brave Englishmen of War,
Accompanied with Soldiers stout,
Bold hearts and void of fear,
Prepared and accoutered
In habit for the Sea:
I Will to the Wars go Volunteer
And serve his Majesty.
The Duke of York rides Admiral,
His Highness wee'^e attend
This Noble hearted General
Will prove our Countries friend;
But when we come upon the Seas
Then merrily we will Sing,
And bo^dly venture in the Wars
And service for the King.

THeir States are grown so quarelsome,
They now ^xclu^e their Prince,
But their unlawful Governments
All Nations will Convince,
From those confused multitudes
Of Sects, does Rebels Spring,
Which in our land did mischief plot,
Against our gracious King.
When Rebel^ion there was hatch
Against their Masters Throne
An Army was forthwith dispatched
To make the Town their own:
But we will subdue the Trojans true
If they our Force will cry,
And boldly Fight for Englands Right
To serve his Majesty.
When Cromwels Nose they did oppose,
The English peirced their life:
But when Usurpers fall at odds
The Devil must end the strife:
But now we have encouragement
To show our Loyalty:
We Will to the Wars go Volunteeres
And serve his Majesty.
What though we be but Prentises,
We have our Masters grant,
Then shall the terror of the Seas
Our Courage never daunt:
As Fortune favors many a man,
We may advanced be
When in the Wars like Volunteres
We serve his Majesty.
They all complain that Guin^s gone
And their men Route there
Their Castles taken and undone,
Which makes them d(...) swear,
But the truth is, they would have taken
Our Forts by Treachery,
Wherefore let us go Volunteres
And serve his Majesty.
The N^a^ars of that Country,
With English Forces joins,
And match's against their Enemies
To purchase Gold^n Mines.
To take and ransack Garrisons,
Rich Plunder would there be:
I Will to the Wars go Voluntere
And serve his Majesty.
Brave Lawson does upon us call,
And does for War prepare
Against the Hollanders Forces all
That prate and dominere.
Heel give the Onset, One to Three,
And make their Ears to Ring,
I Will to the Wars go Voluntere
And Venture for the King.
With Allowance.
