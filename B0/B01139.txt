Unto the Christian Reader.
ALl you that this shall read or here,
mark well what does ensue:
Of those that Christ his word abuse,
what lot falls to that crew.
I need not here at large resite,
true subjects knows right well:
The troubles great that chaunst of late,
by such as did rebel
Against our Savior and his word,
which he to us has send,
Also against our noble Queen,
which does the same defend.
By bloody broils, these Rebels thought
to have the upper hand:
And to molest our noble Queen,
and to defile the land,
With such Idolatry as erst
was used long ago:
The Papist sect for to advance,
their cursed mind was so.
And to deface Gods holy word,
it was their whole intent:
And to tread down the Christen flock,
these Rebels so were bente.
But often times thus have we heard,
and now the proof have seen:
Who digs a pit for other men,
may fall himself therein.
So has it pleased the Lord above,
to trap those wicked train:
And to help those that does by right,
his godly word maintain.
For when these rebels thought by force,
to bear the bloody sway:
The lord (some of them) to our Queen,
did yield then for a pray.
Which for their Treason justly were
condemned for to die:
Their end to know, if you give care,
I show immediately.
FINIS.

The Confession and end of Thomas Norton.
FRom Tower were these Rebels drawn
to Tyburn for their crime:
The elder of them first must die,
his lot fell so that time.
A godly Preacher then in place,
exhorted him to pray:
His prayers then he did begin
in Lattin there to say.
The Preacher then, to him thus said,
pray you in English here:
Then will the People pray with you:
this answer made he there.
In Lattin will I pray (said he)
my consience trouble not:
His Consience as it seemde by this,
was good toward the Pape.
The Secondarie then did say,
unto this Popish elf,
If that in Lattin you will pray,
Pray then unto your self.
Unto himself he then began,
to pray there secretly:
A Preacher then that willing was,
his duty to aply.
Exhorted him that he would pray,
in English as he should:
With much a do, at last to him
he granted that he would.
The Lords prayer then did he say,
the Aue and the Creed:
All Saints he did desire likewise,
to pray for him in deed.
Both then, and when, that he from thens
departed was and gone:
With better Faith he might have build
on the head corner stone.
The Preacher that instructed him,
did will him to confess
His fact against our Lord and God,
and eke our Queen doubtless.
And how their risinge and their strife,
was to beat down thereby
The word of God, and that he had
deserved there to die.
To him he made this answer then,
the offense that I have done,
I truly here for it must die,
hither therefore I come.
The Lord forgiveness did he ask,
and so his end he made:
The Hangman made a quick dispatche,
as is his wonted trade.
He asking none forgiveness there,
nor none he did forgive:
In steed of Pope, the Hangman then,
full quickly did him shriue.
Therefore I warn you Rebels all,
a mende while ye have space,
Unless the Tiburne nagge you ride,
or else at such like place.
The end and Confession of Christopher Norton.
THus when the eldest of them had,
paid well for Popish play:
The younger then must follow him,
and trudge the self same way.
Which then did see before his face,
what death his Uncle did:
And how in lumpes to quarter him,
the pearceing blade did slide.
Then on the earth he kneeled down,
his face unto the East:
And then his Prayers he begone,
as to him seemed best.
For of them both the younger did,
more godly of the twain:
Whereby is seen in Papists old,
what stubborn hearts remain.
The younger being asked then,
where he did there believe:
Saved to be by Christ his death,
this answer did he give.
I do believe saved to be,
by Jesus Christ on hie:
For in no other do I trust,
he then immediately.
Did there desire the people all,
in presence as they were:
That he there died a Christian true,
they all should witness bear.
To him one said, confess ye hear,
you have deserude to die:
And that you have offended God,
and the Queens Majesty.
I have deserved this death said he,
and you that are present:
Example ye may take by me:
he then incontinent
Did ask were any there did know,
Phillip Sturly by name:
Which Captain now in Scotland is,
says some, we know the same.
He is the causer of my death,
the Lord it him forgive:
The more he was all Englands friend,
such Traitors to repreue,
Then of his tale he made an end,
and from his talk did stay:
And did desire the people all,
that they with him would pray.
The Lords prayer when he had said,
and peoples repeat past:
Then in this wise unto the Lord,
he prays at the last
I Christopher Norton that am,
com heather for to die:
Having my body whole and sound,
and perfect memory.
Do hear confess before the Throne,
of thy high Majesty:
O Lord my fact here at this time,
I do confess to thee.
Desiring thee with heart O Lord,
to have on me mercy:
Which now am coming unto thee,
hear ready for to die.
Receive me Lord most merciful,
a wretch which have offend:
Merciful Lord, refuse me not,
but to my cry attend.
And being hanged and cut down,
as quartred he should be:
His bowels being taken out,
These words that time spoke he.
Lord, Lord, have mercy on me now,
and so he yielded breath:
God grant all other to beware,
by these two Rebels death.
An exhortation to all true subjects, and a warning to the Papists.
IF all men did perceive the heaps,
of mischief that ensue
And what mishap Treason does bring,
no doubt they would be true.
For first the Lord they do offend,
as Paul does justly prove:
Which says thy sword against thy prince
thou shall not draw ne move.
And those that Treason do conspire,
this is their purpose plain:
To bring destruction to the land,
wherein they do remain.
With loss of lands, of Goods, and life,
this haps by Treson fell:
And for the most part to all such,
as use for to rebel.
Therefore all subjects call to mind,
these plagues that sure will flow,
Unto all those whereas in heart,
such Treason use to grow.
Therefore ye subjects high and low,
see that your hearts be sure,
And that you ground both heart and faith,
upon the Gospel pure.
Let not these Papists with their bragges
with all their maine and might:
Cause us to fear, they have the wrong,
and we the quarrel right.
Be true unto our noble Queen,
which has the sword in hand:
Let not your hearts once fear or shrink,
but boldly by her stand.
Against the Papists and the Pope,
with all your might and power:
Which seek the ways, like raueninge woulen
the Gospel to deuowre.
Which is the cheifest iuell I say,
that on the earth does reign:
Let us not change this Treasure then,
for trifles that are vain.
Believe you not the Fables old,
that Papists use to tell:
Bow not your ear unto their talk,
which are the steps to Hell.
For some there be that use to feign,
and godliness profess:
Which bear two faces in one hoode,
such is their wickedness,
To trap and turn such swaruing minds
unto their wicked trade
Of Poprie, which we may be sure,
the Devil himself has made.
Away ye Serpents that so lurk,
the Gospel is so pure:
It will confound your poisoned stinge,
ye may not long endure.
Repent therefore, in time amend,
forsake your wicked ways:
Use not such trade, which justly does
the Lord our God displease.
Unless such plagues do fall on you,
As did on these of late:
For if you do not soon amend,
you hardly will escape.
And all true Subjects now take heed
let no intisement cause
That you do yield unto the Pope,
or bow unto his laws.
Remember that we have a Queen,
God save her noble grace:
That sets forth Gods word a right,
which does the Pope deface.
Then for her grace, all subjects true,
are bound for her to pray:
That from her foes, the Lord God will,
preserve her night and day.
Finis.
To the Papists.
YOu Popish route,
Look well about,
And warning hereby take;
Unless you swinge,
In Tyburne stringe,
As some did but of late.
Your selves submit,
As it is fit,
Unto the Lord above:
Then as I deem,
Our noble Queen,
Ye cannot choose but love.
Which does maintain,
I tell you plain,
Gods word which is so pure;
Why do ye then,
Resist again,
And treason so procure.
I do not feign,
But tell you plain,
If you do not amend:
Such plagues may fall,
As will you gall,
And thus I make an end.
FINIS.
