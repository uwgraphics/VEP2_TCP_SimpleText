Cupids Tragedy: EIBNG Corydon's Courtship; Or, Philomels Exaltation.
To the Tune of, The new Bory; Or, Will you be a Man of Fashion.




^ ^ Pretty Phillomel was so Charming,
so much sweetness graced each part:
All her actions so allarming,
so much goodness in her heart:
That who ever saw this fair one,
needs her Votary must be:
She, ah! she, is Natures dear one,
and I fear no less to me.
Every smile was so betraying,
in each look a Plot she laid:
This I knew, yet was obeying,
though I saw each Ambuscade.
And, to show my forward duty,
needs must venture in her sight,
Till her Sentinels of Beauty
struck me blind with too much light.
In this Transport, like a creature,
with too sudden joy overcome,
Gazed upon this lovely Creature,
till with ecstasy struck dumb:
Yet my posture did discover
that I was her humble Slave,
And I found she liked her Lover,
by a Signal that she gave.




WHen I saw my Pardon granted.
straight I did approach her han^
Kissed and sighed, and sighed and panted,
all my senses were at stand:
Then she laughed, and plainly told me
I more manly would appear:
And carress a Nymph more boldly,
if that Phillis were but there.
But if Corydon will leave her,
Phillis need not to despair,
Young Alexis will receive her,
and your Choice will be less fair.
Search the Groves and every Bower,
set the Nymphs all on a row:
Phillis is of a^l the Flower,
and does bend the sharpest Bow.
Ah, said I, divinest Creature,
that the Powers above e're made:
Do not wrong the Gods and Nature,
but repent of what you have said:
Phillis does not think so vainly,
for to give the Maid her due:
Often she is said the Gods that made you,
does admire themselves in you.
Coridon, quoth she, your praises,
if you love do not displease:
But I know a Shepherds phrases
can dissemble a Disease:
If my Beauty has the power
to attract to brave a Swain:
Walk with me to yonder Bower,
I will gratify your aim.
Strephon all this while lay panting
in a Cave, where he could hear
Her too easy heart consenting,
what he begged for many a year.
Out he rusht from forth the Thicket,
with his Iavelin he run
In poor Coridon did strike it,
dye, said he, thou happy Man.
When poor philomel saw him bleeding,
stretched along upon the ground:
From her eyes the tears succeeding,
with which she washed the bloody wound.
Wrung her hands, and tore her hair,
sighed that ever she was born:
Coridon, quoth she, my Dear,
do not leave me thus forlorn.
Thus poor philomel in distraction
called on her loved Coridon:
Prayed the Gods for satisfaction,
thorough her heart a Poniard run.
Thus, said she, the Gods deliver
those that in true love do join:
Thine, dear Coridon, thine for ever,
thou in life and death art mine.
FINIS.
