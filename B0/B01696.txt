The bonny bruicked Lassie she is blew beneath the Eye.
DOwn by yon River side,
where early falls the Dew,
Betwixt my Love and I,
there were kind Kisses anew;
There were kind Kisses anew,
betwixt my Love and I,
For the bonny bruick'd Lassie
she is blew beneath the Eye.
Down in yon Garden green
where Ladies make repair,
There grows a Tree of Pride
that once did flourish fair:
But now the leaves blown off't
and it is withered with the Frost;
For my Love he is gone,
and all my Labor lost.
I wish I were a Man,
then if it were my chance,
In Battle for to die
although it were in France:
Although it were in France,
to end my Misery,
For the bonny bruick'd Lassie,
she is blew beneath the Eye.
If I thought it not Sin,
my own self for to slae,
I Would be revenged on him
who is wrought me all this Wae,
Who Is wrought me all this Wae,
and cause of my Misery,
For the bonny bruick'd Lassie.
she is blew beneath the Eye.
When you go over Seas,
be cunning in your Craft,
For when you were at home,
you did visit me too often,
You did visit me too often,
the truth I Will tell you plain,
For there is nothing in my Mind
but Love for Love again.
FINIS.
