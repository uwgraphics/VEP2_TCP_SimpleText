The Patient Wife betrayed; OR, The Lady Elizabeth's Tragedy.
Which was acted between a Knight her Husband, and a wicked Woman his Whore.
To the Tune of, Chevy Chase, or The Lady Izabells Tragedy.


OF Turkey lately I did read
concerning of a Knight,
How that a Whore did him entice
to kill his hearts delight.
This man it seems was well beloved
by many a gallant Peer,
And for his sake there lives they would lose
he was beloved so dear.
A virtuous wife belike he had
with beauty fresh and gay,
Who gave him twenty thousand pound
upon her Wedding day,
They loved each other very well
and lived a happy Life,
In four years space three pretty babes
he had by this his wife.
But at the last a lewd Woman
his company did keep,
Which made his Wife and children small
with grieved hearts to weep.
Quoth she fair Knight I love you dear
but yet my heart do rue,
Because your Wife do envy me
for loving you so true.
Then presently the Knight he said
I pray thee be content,
And of my wife be not afraid
the blame I will prevent.
With that he goes unto his Wife
and beats her very sore,
And make his Lady pardon crave
for offending of his Whore.
HE made his Lady give consent
that she should with him dwell,
And charged his servants to content
this Whore which he loved well.
This Harlot she so brazen was
and clearly void of grace,
That she to bed with him would go
before his Ladies face.
And thus poor soul this Lady she
durst not her grief declare,
Because this Whore would pinch her flesh
and pull her by the hair.
She could not yet contented be
with this same harml^ss Wife,
But she di^ study and devize
to take a^ay her life.
Sir Knight your wife cannot you abide
nor me therefore I pray
Let us together both consent
to take her life away.
With that the Knight did strait reply
to it I do agree,
But I do fear if it be known
we both shall hanged be.
But she did bid him strait go home
and to her thus declare.
That she must walk along with him
in the fields to take the Air.
His Wife then ready did her make
and joyful was at this,
That she did hang about his neck
and gave him many a kiss.
Then walked they both to a wood,
whereas ^his Harlot lay
And when they came near to the place
he from her run away.
Then did this whore come running forth
out of the Wood with speed,
With a sharp dagger in her hand
to act a cruel deed,
The Lady to see her was amazed
armed with Dagger and Raise
Which make her mournfully to cry
for Gods sake save my Life.
But she no pity on her took
though she did beg and c^ave
She presently did cut her throat
and made the Ditch her Grave.
This passed on for two long years
with s^uces that he made,
Which made his Harlot often say
we shall not be betrayed.
But now one Day they merry was
with wine and costl^ cheer,
Then presently a Ghost came in
which put them a^l in fear.
And to this Knight she strait ways went
and thus to him did say,
Because that thou betray^'st my life
thou shall with me away.
His friends and acquaintance being their
and Gentry great store
Did see this Knight carried away
and never heard of more.
But when this Whore to trial came
the Iewry did agree.
That she should be chained to a stake
and so burned presently.
Thus you do hear what Whores can do
if they can have their will,
They Will strive to plot all that they can
all modesty to kill.
