AN ELEGY, On the Most Lamented of Princes King CHARLES the Second, Our Late
Sovereign of ever Blessed Memory.
11. Feb. 1685/4.
IF Sorrow's all we pay a Heaven-Crown'd Head,
The only Offering to the Royal Dead:
To Gracious CHARLES, for all our Vast Arrears,
For almost Twenty Pardoned Stiffneck't Years;
Oh! What does England owe in Sighs and Tears.
Nor bound our Griefs to Albion's narrow Shore:
All Europe thy Great Arbiter Deplore;
Whose Hand, the World's Great Scale of Empire bore.
Nor the Impoverished World alone shall weep
At CHARLES's Obsequies; the Mighty Deep
For Dying CHARLES, shall Solemn Mournings keep.
The Wailing Tritons on the Ecchoing Main,
Who in Returning CHARLES's Glorious Train,
Once with Shril Trumps did his Loud Triumphs play,
At His Miraculous Restoration Day;
All Shouting as the Glittering Monarch Rode,
Neptunes more Young, but Greater Rival God;
Now throw their useless Untuned Shells away;
And with those Tears, that Funeral Duty pay,
Shall add New Brine to the o reflowing Sea.
And the Proud Waves which the Great Hero bore,
Roll Heavily along the Albion Shore,
And bear the Mournful Sound the Traveled Ocean over.
Bright Saint Farewell, in whom all Virtues shone
So God-like Great, that Thou Blessed CHARLES alone,
Have for lost Britain more from Heaven obtained,
Then Pious Lot for the Cursed Sodom gained.
Midst all the hovering Plagues our Crimes pursue
For thy Great Sire's still Crying Murder due;
Thou CHARLES our kind Propitiator stood,
A Prince so Gracious, so Divinely Good,
Thy Mercy even Atoned thy Fathers Blood.
Thy Death were too Severe a Stroke of Fate,
Did not Surviving JAMES the Edge rebate:
Thy Darling JAMES, thy Dearest Half before,
Now thy Great ALL: For though thy Courser Oar
In Dust must Sleep; Thy Brighter Virtues still
In our New CAESAR their Old Orb shall fill:
Whilst a Bright Spark of thy Celestial Fire,
Full of thy Mighty Self shall His Great Soul inspire.
When Future Times Great CHARLES shall take Review,
Of thy Bright Fames Immortal Volumes through;
Thy Birth, thy Fate, thy Life, thy Acts, thy Reign,
All wondrous Links of one continued Chain;
Are Truths succeeding Ages shall receive,
Amazed to hear, and staggering to believe:
To see the Changing Revolutions move
By the Almighty Guiding Hand above:
Here to behold the Royal FATHER Bleed!
Oh Execrable Wound! Infernal Deed.
Of which all Story shall a Parallel want,
And Hell a Pencil black enough to Paint.
Like Old Jerusalems Prodigious Day,
See Darkness spread, and scattered Lightnings Play;
Hell Yawning, and Religion, Government,
Church, Crown, all like the unveyl'd Temple Rent:
Whilst the Graves ope'd and all the Loyal Dead,
In CHARLES His Cause, in Honors Noblest Bed,
Roused up to see that Stroke of Horror given,
That Robbed a Rebel World, to enrich Heaven.
Here change the Scene and see the SON Restored:
A thousand bended Necks to mount their Lord.
Hear the loud Joys and Hallelujahs Sound,
And view the Host of Glittering Guards all round.
Ten Thousand Angels in the Van appear,
And three Adoring Kingdoms fill the Rear.
Where such strange Turns the wondrous Machins Play,
There such black Night, and here such dazzling Day:
Heaven, Mighty CHARLES, did in thy Race Decree
To draw the Portrait of the Deity.
The Fathers Fall with the Sons Glory joined,
Sure even in Thee, the Mystic Shilo Shined;
His Cross thy Sires, His Resurrection Thine:
Original None more Bright, No Copy more Divine.
FINIS
