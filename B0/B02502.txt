BY HIS EXCELLENCY.
WHereas it has pleased God by h s gracious Providence and Goodness, to put
the City of Edinburgh, and Town of Leith under my power; And although I have
put forth several Proclamations since my coming into this Country to the like
effect, with this present: Yet for further satisfaction to all those whom it
may concern; I do hereby again publish and de^^are, that all the Inhabitants
of the country (now not being ^or continuing in Arms) shall have free leave and
liberty (...) come to the Army, and to the City and Town aforesaid, ^^th their
Cattle, Corn, Horse, or other Commodities or ^oods whatsoever, and shall there
have free and open Mar^^ts for the same, and shall be protected in their
persons and goods ^^ods, in coming and returning as aforesaid, from any inju^
or violence of the Soldiery, under my Command, and shall ^^^^l also be
protected in their respective houses. And the Ci^^ens and Inhabitants of the
said City and Town; shall (and ^by likewise) have free leave to vend and sell
their wares and Commodities, and shall be protected from the plunder and
violence of the Soldiers, And I do hereby require all Officers and Souldirs
of the Army under my command, to ^ake due notice hereof, and to yield obedience
hereto, as they will answer the contrary at their utmost peril.

Given under my hand at Edinburgh the 7th of September, 1650. O. CROMWELL.
