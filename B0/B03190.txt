An Excellent New SONG, Entitled, Valiant Iockie
His LADIES Resolution.
To be sung to its own proper Tune.
VAliant Jockie,s marched away,
To fight a Battle with great Mackay;
Leaving me poor Soul alas! forlorn,
To curse the hour that ever I was born
But I swear I Will follow too,
And dearest Jockie,s Fate pursue;
Near him be, to guard his precious Life,
Never Scot had such a Loyal Wife.
Sword I Will wear, I Will cut my hair;
Taken my Cheeks that was so fair;
In Soldiers weed to him I Will speed,
Never such a Trooper crossed the Tweide.
Trumpet sound the victory,
Sure I Will be killed, the nixt Dundee;
Loves raging Fate does all agree,
To do some glorious act for me:
Great Bellonia take my part,
Fame and honor guard my Heart;
That for poor old Scotlands good,
Some brave Action may deserve my blood
Naught shall appear, from all Fame I fear,
Fighting by his side I loved so dear;
All the World shall own that never was known
Such a Loyal Lass this Thousand year.
Now in Noble Armor bright,
I with coragious Heart will fight;
Fear of death shall never my courage stain,
Our King's Right I will maintain:
For the glory of our Sex,
We all our Rebels shall perplex,
And let them find that Women kind,
Sometimes venture with a warlike mind,
Age of old, our Fame has told,
Therefore I shall never be controlled;
By Friend, or Foe, I Will freely go;
Never was a Trooper Armed so.
I shall a helmet then put on,
Armed like a valiant warlike Man;
Plats of steel shall guard my Back and Breast,
Carabines and Pistols I Will protest,
In my Hand, I Will cock and prime,
Now and for ever is the time;
While I am mounted thus Cappa pi;
Warlike Thunder shall my Music be:
Let smoke arise and dim the Skies,
While we pursue the warlik prize;
Lauralls shall us crown, with true renown,
The Victory, in City, Court and Town.
Mars the God of war shall lead
Our Army, that shall fight and Bleed;
Or e're our Foes shall hope to win the day
Therefore let us march with speed away
Hark, I hear the Ttumpets sound,
We shall be all with Conquests Crowned;
Let all my Foes brag and boast,
Victory and Triumph shall ride through the Host
Glory and Fame shall then proclaim
The Actions of a warlik valiant Dame;
If Foes draw nigh, I Will scorn't to Fly,
But with my dearest Love I Will live and dye.
FINIS
