CVPIDS COVRTESIE: in the wooing of fair S^bina.
To a pleasant new Tune.




AS on a day Sabina fell asleep,
Into her bower it was my chance to creep,
I first spoke soft,
I first spoke soft,
I first spoke soft,
then loud unto my dear,
Which fair Sabina heard
but would not hear.
When I perceived she did but wink and wake,
Unto my self more courage did I take,
And thought it best,
And thought it best,
And thought it best,
and fittest time to woe,
The which Sabina knew
but would not know.
Then did I lay me by her on the grownd,
Whereas I first Sabina sleeping found,
Then did I touch,
Then did I touch,
Then did I touch,
her pretty foot and heel,
The which Sabina felt,
but would not feel.
When I had first performed this trick of love,
A maiden-blush her eyelids seemed to move,
But yet she slept,
But yet she slept,
But yet she slept,
with wakeful winking eye,
But still Sabina lay,
but would not lie.
Then marks of beauty on her cheeks I spied,
With fair Vermillion blushes sweetly died,
Where Cupids lips,
Where Cupids lips,
Where Cupids lips,
a dainty Kiss might crave,
Which fair Sabina had,
but would not have.
Thus when that I by beauties kind command,
Had felt the sweetest moisture of her hand,
With quaking fear,
With quaking fear,
With quaking fear,
I pulled my hand away,
So was Sabina coy,
but said not nay,
The second part,
to the same Tune.




Now fearing left my boldness should offend,
God Cupid I desired for my friend,
with golden Bow,
with golden Bow,
with golden Bow,
to shoot a shaft of love,
The which Sabina proved,
but could not prove.
When I had practiced every way but one,
Unto my dearest dear I made my moan,
Sweet grant me love,
Sweet grant me love,
Sweet grant me love,
O now me love or never,
Which fair Sabina gave,
but was no giver.
Yet all this while I did my dear no wrong,
Though she was dumb, yet had my love a tongue
To plead for love,
To plead for love,
To plead for love,
unto my fairest fair,
For which Sabina card,
but would not care.
For my hearts woe Sabina could not weep,
For she presumed I thought her still asleep,
And so I did,
And so I did,
And so I did,
and will do while I live,
In that Sabina gave,
but would not give.
A woman's love which secretly does hide it,
Will soon grow fickle if once she be denied it,
Yet she will say nay,
Yet she will say nay,
Yet she will say nay,
and so I must say too,
Thus was Sabina wooed,
but would not woe.
With kisses kindly from her I did part,
She to my love, and gave to me her heart,
Which I will keep,
Which I will keep,
Which I will keep,
tide up in chains of gold,
For what Sabina had,
she could not hold.
