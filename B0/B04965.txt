THE Queen of the Milk-women; OR, AN ELEGY Occasioned by the Death of, Mrs. E.
G.
Who departed this life on (...) Morning October 6th School. As also a full and
true Account how she (...) Sta(...) (...) Threescore Milk-women in Mourning for
her.


COme you Lasses and Maids,
Who pursue Milking Trades,
With your Pail: on your Heads strait appear*
Whilst I mourn the sad fall,
Of the Chief of you All,
And the best too as much as (...)
She Is Dead, let each pour
Or her Corpse a Milk shower,
To preserve and to moisten (...)
That a Person so just
May Not too soon (...) to Dust,
Or too (...) Vermin a Prey
Ah! how when all (...)
She graced those who survive,
Who admired at the Qualities in (...)
How She looked like a (...)
When She Danced upon (...)
With her Green (...)
But her Maidens may boas^
Of her Charity most,
And her goodness in g(...) (...) Liquor;
For Lord how She Would Swill,
And give each of 'm her (...)
To make 'em mo^^ sp^^^ (...)
Both Distiller and Host,
May lament that, she is (...)
For she was their (...) certain (...)
And a B^^n Companion,
As cheerful as any one
Whilst the Quartern and Bottle did (...)
(...) had other good vertu^s
(...) which she showed to all parties,
^ ^ot dashing her n^w M^lk with water,
And she took as great pleasure
In f(...) and full Measure.
As the rest of her Trade do in (...).
Th(...) uncommon deserts,
May ^ake all True Hearts.
To conclude that she died well and Godly,
For if she had not,
Took up her full Pot,
Her death would have looked very Odly.
But now Threescore trapes,
Are in black Cloth, and Crapes,
As an Argument that she died well.
I mean well to pass,
For wise man nor Ass,
Any more of her Exit can ^^ll.
She served Queen, her Mistress
late of, and in distress,
And I must needs say this to her Honor,
Though Her Money was good,
As no doubt a Queen's should
She had money a fair Coach-Wheel upon her
As she served High and Great,
(...) Lies now in State,
By Rich and by Poor to be seen,
With Milk she supplied
The Queen Dowager's Bride,
And of Milk-Women she Died the Queen.
