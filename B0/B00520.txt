Times Alteration:
OR,
The Old Man's rehearsal, what brave days he knew
A great while agone, when his Old Cap was new.
To the Tune of, I Will nere be drunk again.


When this Old Cap was new,
it is since two hundred year,
No malice then we knew,
but all things plenty were:
All friendship now decays,
(believe me, this is true)
Which was not in those days,
when this old Cap was new.
The Nobles of our Land
were much delighted then,
To have at their command
a Crew of lusty Men,
Which by their Coats were known,
of Tawnie, Red, or Blue,
With Crests on their sleeves shown,
when this old Cap was new.
Now Pride has banished all,
unto our Lands reproach,
When he whose means is small,
maintains both Horse and Coach:
In stead of an hundred Men,
the Coach allows but two;
This was not thought on then,
when this old Cap was new.
Good Hospitality
was cherisht then of many;
Now poor men starve and die,
and are not helped by any:
For Charity waxes cold,
and Love is found in few:
This was not in time of old,
when this old Cap was new.
Where ever you trauel'd then,
you might meet on the way
Brave Knights and Gentlemen,
clad in their Country Gray,
That courteous would appear,
and kindly welcome you:
No Puritans then were,
when this old Cap was new.
Our Ladies in those days
in civil Habit went,
Broad-Cloth was then worth praise,
and gave the best content:
French Fashions then were scorned,
fond Fangles then none knew,
Then Modesty Women adorned,
when this old Cap was new.
The Second Part.
To the same Tune.


A Man might then behold,
at Christmas, in each Hall,
Good Fires, to curb the Cold,
and Meat for great and small:
The Neighbors were friendly bidden,
and all had welcome true,
The poor from the Gates were not chidden,
when this old Cap was new.
Black Iackes to every man
were filled with Wine and Beer,
No Pewter Pot nor Kanne
in those days did appear:
Good cheer in a Noble-mans house
was counted a seemly show,
We wanted no Brawne nor Sowse,
when this old Cap was new.
We took not such delight
in Cups of Silver fine,
None under the degree of a Knight,
in Plate drunk Beer or Wine:
Now each Mechanical man
has a Cup-boord of Plate, for a show,
Which was a rare thing then,
when this old Cap was new.
Then Briberie was unborn,
no Simonie men did use,
Christians did Usury scorn,
devised among the Jews,
Then Lawyers to be Feed,
at that time hardly knew,
For man with man agreed,
when this old Cap was new.
No Captain then carowst,
nor spent poor Soldiers Pay,
They were nor so abused,
as they are at this day:
Of seven days they make eight,
to keep from them their due;
Poor Soldiers had their right,
when this old Cap was new.
Which made them forward still
to go, although not pressed:
And going with good will,
their fortunes were the best,
Our English then in fight
did foreign Foes subdue,
And forced them all to flight,
when this old Cap was new.
God save our gracious King,
and send him long to live,
Lord, mischief on them bring,
that will not their Alms give*
But seek to rob the Poor
of that which is their due:
This was not in time of yore,
when this old Cap was new.
