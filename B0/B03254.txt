ELEGY ON THE UNIVERSALY LAMENTED DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE LADY ANN ELCHO.
THe universe, it seems, is drawing nigh,
It Is final, and foredom'd Catastrophie.
We have seen, it is fiery preluds seize upon,
And mar the glory of our Caledone,
In her most stately structurs, And we see,
That human kind is not from the same free,
And burning seavers every where do waste,
And moulder humane bodies unto dust,
As if this present Age were to expire,
Both with all time, and the universal fire.
My Lady ELCHO we the more Lament,
That She by a malignant flame is sent,
And early to the charnel house does pass,
Since nothing of malignant in Her was:
She Is as i^lustrious in her pedigree;
And name, as the most Noble family.
That Is here: her father's, and her brother's bays,
Are as extensive as Apollo's rays;
All the conspicious honors of the face,
And symmetrie, our Lady ANN did grace.
And all the rare accomplishments we find,
Dispersed in others, renter'd in Her mind.
A snow like candor did adorn Her Soul;
It ever was without all fraud and guile;
And all the actions, which from hence did flow,
Were like the source upright, and serene too;
She of all other virtues had such store,
As there be flowers which Flora's brow decore.
So were it the custom now to canonize,
We might Her in the Alb of saints comprise:
She either was as free from stains as they,
Or had She faults, the flame purged these away.
And She Is gone straight above the starry pole,
Leaving Her noble Husband to condole.
His double loss Alace! a phrase to mild!
Where His most loving Lady and dear Child,
Or rather Children, and all hopes from them,
Ascend like to Elijah in a flame,
Only well grounded hopes of Her blessed state,
Can His excessive agonies abate,
And the two hopeful boys She left behind,
May mitigat the sorrows of His mind,
