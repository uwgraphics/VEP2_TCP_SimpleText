UPON The just judgment of his Majesty's Unjust JUDGES.
BUT now they are come to Judgment, Heaven is just,
And though it be long, before he questions Dust,
They shall not go unpunisht for that thing,
That horrid thing! of murdering their King.
'Twas bad enough, against their King to rise,
But ten times worse, their King to sacrifise;
But worst of all, under a show of Zeal,
To rob the Church, and spoil the Commonweal:
And so make God, the Author of their ill,
Pretending 'twas his pleasure, and his will.
Thus, how from sin to sin, the Devil draws
Ambitious spirits, to infringe Gods Laws;
Still prompting them, from what is bad, to worse,
Until they are fitted, for Heavens heavy curse.
Pray Heaven, that their example, and their shame,
May others keep, from thinking of the same.
By George Cartwright, Gent.
