Oppertunity Lost, Or
The Scotch Lover Defeated.
Here willy follows Peggy still
But never attains to have his will
His slowness caused the hasty Maid
To call a Miller to her aid:
Who nimbler then her Lover seaz'd
And straight her hasty passion eased.
To a pleasant Northern tune.
With Allowance.





There was Lass our Town
Slay Willy Stenson
He loved a Lass was bonny and brown
It Was pretty Peggy Benson.
Each morn as he gang'd to the field
Slay Willy Stenson
He wa'd some proof of kindness yield
To plretty Peggy Benson.
Her Beauty sea his heart had fier'd
Slay Willy Stenson
He coud not tell what he desired
Of pretty Peggy Benson.
He followed her through Kirk and Kie
Slay Willy Stenson,
But guard not yet declare his weell
To pretty Peggy Benson.
But once upon a Summer day
Slay Willy Stenson,
He gang'd abroad a making hay
with pretty Peggy Benson.
He blithe and bonny was that day
Slay Willy Stenson,
Cause he might wanton in the hay
with pretty Peggy Benson.
Quo he, dict Lass i would ligg thee down
Slay Willy Stenson,
An 'twon't for moyling thy green gown,
my pretty Peggy Benson.
The Lass replied it cost thee naught
Slay Willy Stenson,
Then ligg me down and spare me not
Quo pretty Peggy Benson.
Gad quo the Lad, ise tell thee what
Slay Willy Stenson,
Ise ene gang heam, and fetch my Cleak
for pretty Peggy Benson.
He went heam, and came again
Slay Willy Stenson,
But he found a Miller on her wem
Oh filthy Peggy Benson.
He wished his Cleak had been ith fire
Slay Willy Stenson,
Sen he had lost his hearts desire
And pretty Peggy Benson.
She bade him come another day
Slay Willy Stenson,
She left him sad tript away
O naughty Peggy Benson.
