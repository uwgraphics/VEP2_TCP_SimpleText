The Tragedy of Phillis, complaining of the disloyal love of AMYNTAS. To a new
Court tune.
Amyntas on a Summers day,
to shun Apollo's beams,
Was driving of his flocks away,
to taste some cooling streams:
And through a Forest as he went,
hard by a Rivers side,
A voice which from a Grove was sent
invited him to bide.
The voice well seemed for to bewray
some male-contented mind,
For oftimes did he he are it say,
ten thousand times unkind:
The remnant of that raging moan
did all escape his ear,
For every word brought forth a groan,
and every groan tear.
And nearer when he did repair,
both face and voice he knew,
He saw that Phillis was come there,
her plaints for to renew:
Thus leaving her unto her plaints,
and sorrow-flaking groans,
He heard her deadly discontents,
thus all break forth at once.
Amyntas, is my love to thee,
of such a light account,
That thou disdain'st to look on me,
or love as thou were wont:
Were those the oaths that thou did make,
the vows thou did conceive,
When I for thy contentments sake,
mine hearts delight did leave:
How often did thou protest to me,
the heavens should turn to naught,
The Sun should first obscuted be,
ere thou would change thy thought:
Then heaven dissolve without delay,
Sun show thy face no more,
Amyntas love is lost for aye,
and woe is me therefore.
Well might I, if I had been wise,
foreseen what now I find,
But too much love did fill mine eyes,
and made my judgment blind:
But ah, alas! the effect does prove,
thy drifts are but deceit,
For true and undissembled love,
will never turn to hate.
All thy behaviors were (God knows)
too smooth and too discreet,
Like Sugar which impoysoned grows,
suspect because it is sweet:
Thine oaths and vows did promise more
then well thou could perform,
Much like a calm that comes before
an unexpected storm.
God knows it would grieve me much
for to be killed for thee.
But oh! too near it does me touch,
that thou should murder me:
God knows I care not for the pain
can come for loss of breath,
It Is thy unkindnesse cruel Swain,
that grieves me to the death.
Amyntas tell me if thou may,
if any fault of mine,
Has given thee cause thus to betray
mine hearts delight and shine?
No, no, alas, it could not be,
my love to thee was such,
Unless that if I urged thee,
in loving thee too much.
But ah, alas! What do I gain,
by those my fond complaints?
My dolor doubles thy disdain,
my grief thy joy augments:
Although it yield no greater good,
it often death ease my mind,
For to reproach th'ingratitude
of him who is unkind.
With that her hand, cold, wan, and pale,
upon her breast she lays,
And seeing that her breath did fail,
she sighs and then she says;
Amyntas, and with that poor Maid,
she sighed again full sore,
That after that she never said,
nor sighed, nor breathed no more.
FINIS.

The complaint of the Shepherd Harpalus To a pleasant new tune.


Poor Harpalus, oppressed with love,
sat by a Crystal Brook,
Thinking his sorrows to remove,
ofttimes therein did look:
And hearing how on pibble stones,
the murmuring River ran,
As if it had bewaild his grons,
unto it thus began:
Fair streams (quoth he) that pitties me,
and hears my matchless moan,
If thou be going to the Sea,
as I do now suppone:
Attend my plaints past all relief,
which dolefully I breath
Acquaint the Sea-nymphs with the grief
which still procures my death.
Who sitting in the cliffy Rocks,
may in their songs express,
While as they comb their golden locks,
poor Harpalus distress:
And so perhaps some Passenger,
that passes by the way,
May stay and listen for to hear,
them sing this doleful Lay.
Poor Harpalus a Shepherd Swain,
more rich in youth than store,
Loved fair Philena, hapless man,
Philena, oh therefore!
Who still remorecelesse hearted Maid,
took pleasure in his pain,
And his good will, poor sonle, repaid
with undeserved disdain.
Nere Shepherd loved Shepherdess
more faithfully then he,
Nere Shepherd yet beloved less
of Shepherdess could be:
How often did he with dying looks,
to her his woes impart.
How often his sighs did testify
the dolor of his heart.
How often from Valleys to the Hills,
did he his grief rehearse?
How often re-ecchoed they his ills,
aback again (alas?)
How often on Barks of stately Pines,
of Beech, of Holly-greene,
Did he ingrave in mournful lines,
the grief he did sustain?
Yet all his plaints could have no place,
to change Philena's mind,
The more his sorrows did increase,
the more she proved unkind:
The thought thereof with wearied care
poor Harpalus did move,
That overcome with high despair,
he lost both life and love.
Finis.
