A CATECHISM OF CHRISTIAN RELIGION.

AT MIDDELBOROUGH, By Richard Schilders, Printer to the States of Zealand. 1610.

A CATECHISM OF CHRISTIAN RELIGION.


1. What is thy only comfort in life and death?

Answer.

THat both in soul and body 1 Cor. 6.19.
, whether I live or die, Romans 14.8.
I am not mine own, but belong 1 Cor. 3.28.
wholly unto my most faithful Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who by his precious
blood most fully satisfying 1 Pet. 1.18.
for my sins, has delivered 1 John 3.8.
me from all the power of the Devil, and so preserves John 6.39.
me, that without the will of my heavenly Father, not so much as a hair may
fall Mar 10.30. Luc 21 19
from my head: yea all things must Rom 8.28.
serve for my safety. Wherefore by his Spirit also he assures 1 Cor. 1.22.
me of everlasting life, and makes Romans 8 24.
me ready, and prepared, that henceforth I may live to him.

2. Quest. How many things are necessary for thee to know, that thou enjoying
this comfort, may live and die happily?

Ans. Three Luke 24. Tit. 3.3 etc.
. The first, what is the John 9.42 Romans 3.10.
greatness of my sin and misery. The second, how I am delivered John 17.3
from all sin and misery. The third, what thanks I owe Ephe. 5.10
unto God for this deliverie.

THE FIRST PART, OF THE MISERY OF MAN.


Whence know thou thy misery?

Answer.

Out of the law of God Romans 3.20.
.

4. Quest. What does the law of God require of us?

Ans. That does Christ summarilie teach us, Mat. 22.

Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with
all thy mind, and with all thy strength Luke 10.17
. This is the first and the great commandment, and the second is like to this:
Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. On these two commandments hangs
the whole Law and the Prophets.

Art thou able to keep all these things perfectly?

Ans. No truly Romans 5.1. 1 John 1.8.
: For by nature I am prone to the hatred of God and of my neighbor Romans 8.7.
Ephe. 2.3.
.

6. Quest. Did God then make man so wicked and perverse?

An. Not so Genesis 1.31.
: but rather he made him good and to his own image Genesis 1.26.
, that is, endued with true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly
know God his Creator, and heartily love him, and live with him blessed for ever,
and that to laud and magnify him 2. Cor. 3.18 4.5. Col. 3.10. Ephe. 1.6.
.

7. Quest. Whence then arises this wickedness of man's nature?

Ans. From the fall and disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve Genesis
5.6. Romans 6.21.
: hence is our nature so corrupt, that we are all conceaved and borne in sin
Psalm. 51.4. Genesis 5.3.8.6.5.
.

8. Quest. Are we so corrupt, that we are not at all apt to do well, and are
prone to all vice?

Ans. In deed we are: except we be regenerated by the holy Ghost John 3.5. Romans
15. Job. 10.4. etc.
.

Does not God then injury to man, who in the Law requires that of him, which
he is not able to perform?

Ans. No John 3.5. Ephe. 4.24. Colo. 3.10.
. For God had made man such a one, as he might perform it: But man, by the
impulsion of the Devil Luke 10.30
, and his own stubburnesse, bereaved him self and all his posterity of those
Divine graces.

10. Quest. Does God leave this stubburnesse and falling away of man unpunished?

Ans. No: but is angry in most dreadful manner Romans 5.12. Heb. 9.27.
, as well for the sins wherein we are borne, as also for those which our
selves commit, and in most just judgment punishes them with present and
everlasting punishments, as him self pronounces: Cursed be he that performs
not all the words of the Law to do them Deuteronomy. 27.24 Gal. 3.10.
.

11. Quest. Is not God therefore merciful?

Ans. Yea verily, he is merciful Exodus 34.6.
but so, that he is also just Exodus 20.5. 2. Cor. 6.14.
Wherefore his justice requires, that the same which is committed against the
Divine Majesty of God: should also be recompensed with extreme, that is,
everlasting punishments both of body and soul.

THE SECOND PART, OF MAN'S DELIVERY.


Seeing then by the just judgment of God, we are subject both to temporal,
and eternal punishments; is there yet any means or way remaining, whereby we
may be delivered from these punishments, and be reconciled to God?

Answer.

GOD will have his justice Exodus 20 5
satisfied: wherefore it is necessary, that Romans 8 3
we satisfy, either by our selves, or by an other.

13. Question.

Are we able to satisfy by our selves?

Ans. Nor a whit. Nay rather we do every day Job 9 2, 3. and 15.15. Mat. 6.12.
increase our debt.

14. Quest. Js there any creature able in heaven or in earth, which is only a
creature, to satisfy for us?

Ans. None. For first, God will not Heb. 2.14.
punish that sin in any other creature, which man has committed. And
further, neither can that which is nothing, but a creature, sustain the wrath
of God against sin, and Psalm. 130: ^
deliver others from it.

15. Quest. What manner of Mediator then and deliver must we seek for?

Ans. Such a one verily, as is very man, and perfectly just, and yet in power
above all creatures, that is, who also is very 2 Cor. 5.14. Heb. 7.16. Esa.
7.25.
God.

16. Quest. Wherefore is it necessary that he be very man, and perfectly just
too?

Ans. Because the justice of God requires that the same humane nature which
has sinned, do it self likewise make recompense for sin: But he Romans 5.12.
that is him self a sinner 1. Pet. 3.18.
, can not make recompense for others.

17. Quest. Why must he also be very God?

Ans. That he might by the power of his Godhead 1. Pet. 3.18. Isa. 55.3.
sustain in his flesh the burden of Gods wrath, and 1 John 2. Act. 20.28.
might recover and restore unto us that righteousness and life which we lost.

18. Quest. And who is that Mediator, which is together both very God, and a
very perfect just man?

Ans. Even our Lord Jesus Christ, Mat. 1.23. 1 Timothy 3.16. Luke 2.11.
who is made to us of God wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and Romans 1.2.
Heb. 1.1.
redemption.

19. Quest. Whence know thou this?

Ans. Out of the Gospel, which God first made known in Genesis 3.15.
Paradise, and afterward Gen 22.18. Romans 1.2. Heb. 1.1.
did spreed it abroad by the Patriarchs and Prophets John 5.46. Heb. 10.7.
: shadowed it by sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law: and lastly Rom
10.4. Heb. 13.8.
accomplished it by his only begotten Son.

Is then salvation restored by Christ to all men, who perished in Adam?

Ans. Not to all: but to those only, who by a true faith are engraffed into
him, John 1.12. Romans 11.20. Heb. 10.39.
and receave his benefits.

21. Quest. What is faith?

Ans. It is not only a knowledge, whereby I surely assent to all things which
God has Heb. 11.13. Isa 2.19.
revealed unto us in his word, but also an assured Romans 4.16. Iac. 1.8.
trust kindled in my Romans 1.16. 1 Cor. 1.21. Act^ 16.14.
heart by the holy Mat. 16.17 John 3 5. Phil. 1.19.
ghost through the Gospel, whereby I make my repose in God, being assuredly
resolved, that remission of sins, everlasting righteousness and life Mat. 9.2.
Romans 5.1.
is given not to others only, but to me also, and that freely through the
mercy of God, for the Romans 5.1.
merit of Christ alone.

22. Quest. What are those things which are necessary for a Christian man to
believe?

Ans. All things which are John 20.31 Mat. 28.10.
promised us in the Gospel: the sum whereof is briefly comprised in the
Creed of the Apostles, or in the Articles of the Catholic and undoubted faith
of all Christians.

23. Quest. Which is the Creed?

I Believe in God the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus
Christ his only Son our Lord: which was conceived by the holy Ghost: borne of
the virgin Mary: suffered under Pontius Pilate: was crucified, dead and
buried: he descended into hell: the third day he rose again from the dead: he
ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father
almighty: from thence shall he come to judge the quick and the dead. I
believe in the holy Ghost: the holy Catholic Church: the communion of Saints:
the forgiveness of sins: the resurrection of the body, and the life
everlasting. AMEN.

Into how many parts is this Creed divided?

Ans. Into three parts. The first is, of the eternal Father and our Creation.
The second, of the Son and our Redemption. The third, of the holy Ghost and
our Sanctification.

25. Quest. Seeing there is but one only substance of God, why namest thou
these three, The Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost?

Ans. Because God has so Genesis 1.26. Esa. 1.1. Mat. 3.16.
manifested him self in his word, that these three didistinct persons are that
one true, everlasting God.

OF THE FATHER.
What beleevest thou, when thou say, I believe in God the Father almighty,
maker of heaven and earth?

Ans. I believe the everlasting Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who Gene. 1.
and 2 Psalm. 33.6.
has made of nothing heaven and earth, with all that are in them, who likewise
vpholdeth and Psalm 134.3. Mat 10.29. Heb. 1.3
governs the same by his eternal Counsel and providence; John 1.12 Romans 8.15
Gal. 4 5 Ephe. 1. y.
to be my God and my Father for Christ's sake: and therefore I do so trust in
him, and so rely on him, that I may not doubt, but he will provide all things
Psalm. 55.23 Mat. 6.26.
necessary both for my soul and body. And further, whatsoever evils he
sends on me in this troublesome life, he will Rom 8.28
turn them to my safety, seeing both he is able to do it, as being Romans
10.12.
God almighty, and willing to do it, as being Mat. 6, etc.
a bountiful father.

What is the providence of God?

Ans. The almighty power of God every where present, Acts 17.25
whereby he does as it were with his hand uphold and Heb. 1.3.
govern heaven and earth, with all the creatures therein: So that those things
which grow in the earth, as likewise rain and drought, fruitfulnes and
barraines, meat and Iere 5.24 Act. 14.17.
drink, John 9 3.
health and sickness, Prove. 1^.7.8.11.
riches and poverty, in a word, all things come not rashly or by chance, but by
his fatherly counsel and will.

28. Quest. What does this knowledge of the Creation and providence of God
profit us?

Ans. That in adversity Romans 5.3 Iac. 1.3.
we may be patient, and Deuteronomy. 8.10 1 These. 5.
thankful in prosperity, and Rom 5.4
have hereafter our chiefest hope reposed in God our most faithful father,
being sure that there is nothing which may John 1.1^
withdraw us from his love, for as much as all creatures are so in his power,
that without his will they are not Romans 8.38
able not only to do any thing, but not so much as once to moove.

OF THE SON.
Why is the Son of God called Jesus, that is, a Savior?

Ans. Because he saves us from all our Mat. 1.21 Luke 1.31.
sins: Neither ought any safety to be sought for from any other, nor Acts
4.12
can elsewhere be found.

30. Quest. Do they then believe in the only savior Jesus, who seek for
happiness and safety of the Saints, or of them selves, or els-where?

Answ. No. For although in word they boast them selves of him as their Savior,
yet in deed they deny the only Savior 1 Cor. 1.13 Gal. 5.4
Jesus. For it must needs be that either Jesus is not a perfect Savior, or
that they who embrace him as their Savior with a true faith, possess all
things in him, which Heb. 12.2 Isa. 9.6.7.
are required unto salvation.

Why is he called Christ, that is anointed?

Ans. Because he was ordained of the Father, and anointed of the holy Ghost,
the Psalm. 45.8. Heb. 1.9.
chief Prophet and John 1.18. and 15.15.
Doctor: who has Mat. 11.27. Psalm. 110.4. Heb. 7.21.1
opened unto us the secret counsel and all the will of his father concerning
our Redemption: And the High Priest, who with that one only sacrifice of his
body, has Romans 8.34.
redeemed us, and does continually make intercession to his father for us. And
a Psalm. 2.6. Luke 1.33.
king, who rules us by his word and spirit, and defends and Mat. 28.18.
John 10.28.
maintains that salvation which he has purchased for us.

But why art thou called a Christian?

Ans. Because through faith I am a member of Acts 11.26. 1 Cor. 6.15.
Jesus Christ, and partaker 1 Ioh. 2.27 Joel 2.28.
of his anointing, that both I may Mat. 10.33.
confess his name, and present my self unto him a livelie Romans 12.1. Apoc.
4.8.
sacrifice of thankfulness, and also may in this life fight against sin and
Satan with a free and good conscience, and afterward 1. Tim. 1.18.19.
enjoy an everlasting kingdom with Christ over all creatures.

33. Quest. For what cause is Christ called the only begotten son of God,
when we also are the sons of God?

Answer. Because Christ alone is the coeternall and natural son of the
eternal John 1.14. Heb. 1.2.
father, and we Romans 8.5. Ephe. 1.6.
are but sons adopted of the father by grace for his sake.

Wherefore call thou him our Lord?

Ans. Because he redeeming and ransoming both our body and soul from sins,
not with gold nor silver, but with his precious blood, and delivering us from
all the power of the Devil, has set us 1 Pet. 1.18. 1 Cor. 6.20.
free to serve him.

35. Quest. What beleevest thou, when thou say, he was conceaved by the holy
Ghost, and borne of the Virgin Marie?

Ans. That the son of God, who John 1.1. Col. 1.15.
is and continues true and everlasting Romans 9.5. 1 John 5.20.
God, John 1.14. Gala. 4.4.
took the very nature of man, of the flesh Mat. 1.18. Luke 1.35.
and blood of the Virgin Marie, by the working of the holy Ghost, Psalm. 132.11
Act. 2.30. etc Romans 1.3.
that withal he might be the true seed of David, Phil. 2.7.
like unto his brethren in all things, Heb. 4.15.
sin excepted.

36. Quest. What profit take thou, by Christ's holy conception and nativitie?

Ans. That he is our Ha. 2.16.17.
Mediator, and does cover with his innocence and perfect holiness my sins,
in which I was conceaved, that they may not come in the sight of Psalm. 32.1. 1
Cor. 1.30 Romans 8.34.
God.

What beleevest thou, when thou say, he suffered?

Ans. That he, all the time of his life, which he led in the earth, but
especially at the end thereof, 1 Pet. 2.24 Isa 53.12.
sustained the wrath of God, both in body and soul, against the sin of all
mankind, that he might by his passion, as the only John 2 2. Romans 3.25.
propitiatory Sacrifice, deliver our body and soul from everlasting
damnation, and purchase unto us the favor of God, righteousness, and
everlasting life.

38. Quest. For what cause should he suffer under Pilate, as being his judge?

Ans. That he being innocent and Luc. 23.14 John 19.4.
condemned before a civil judge, might Psalm. 69.4 Gal 3:13
deliver us from the severe judgment of God, which remained for all men.

39. Quest. But is there any thing more in it, that he was fastened to the
cross, than if he had suffered any other kind of death?

Ans. There is more: For by this I am assured that he took upon him self the
curse which did ly on me. For the death of the cross was Deuteronomy. 21. Gal. 3.13.
accursed of God.

Why was it necessary for Christ to humble himself unto death?

Ans Because the justice and truth of God could by no Gene. 2.71.
other means be satisfied for our sins, but by the very death of the Heb.
2.9. Phil. 2.18.
son of God.

41. Quest. To what end was he buried also?

Ans. That thereby he might make manifest, that he was Act. 13.29. John 19.38.
dead in deed.

42. Quest. But since that Christ died for us, why must we also dye?

Ans. Our death is not a satisfaction for our sins, but the abolishing of
sin, and our passage into John 5.24. Phil. 1.23
everlasting life.

43 Quest. What other commodity receyve we by the sacrifice and death of
Christ?

Ans. That by the virtue of his death, our old man is crucified, slain, and
Romans 6.7
buried together with them, that henceforth evil lusts and desires may not
Romans 6.12.
reign in us, but we may Romans 12.2.
offer our selves unto him a sacrifice of thankesgiving.

44. Quest. Why is there added, He descended into hell?

Ans. That in my greatest pains, and most grievous tentations, I may support
my self with this comfort, that my Lord Jesus Christ has delivered Esa. 53.10
Mat. 27.46.
me, by the unspeakable distresses, torments and terrors of his soul, into
which he was plunged both before, and then especially, when he hanged on the
cross, from the straites and torments of hell.

What does the resurrection of Christ profit us?

Ans. First, by his Resurrection he vanquished death, that he might 1. Cor. 15
16. and 54.55.
make us partakers of that righteousness, which he had gotten us by his death.
Again we are now also Romans 6.4. Col. 3.1. etc.
stirred up by his power to a new life. Lastly, the resurrection of our head
Christ, is a 1 Cor. 15. Romans 8.11.
pledge unto us of our glorious resurrection.

46. Quest. How understand you that, He ascended into heaven?

Ans. That Christ, his Disciples looking on, was Act. 1.9. Mar. 16.19.
taken up from the earth into heaven, and yet still Heb. 4.14. Romans 8.34. Ephe.
4.10.
is there for our sakes, and will be, until he come again to judge the quick
and dead.

47. Quest. Mat. 28.20
Is not Christ with us then until the end of the world as he has promised?

Ans. Christ is true God, and true man: and so according to his manhood, he is
not now on earth: but according to his godhead, his majesty, his grace, and
spirit, he is at no time from us.

48. Quest. Are not by this means the two natures in Christ pulled asunder, if
his humanity be not wheresoever his divinity is?

Ans. No: for seeing his divinity is incomprehensible, and every where Act.
1.11. Ma. 24.30.
present: it follows necessarily that Mat. 28.20 John 16.18. and 17.11.
the same is without the bounds of his humane nature which he took to him, and
yet is nevertheless in it and abides personally united to it.

What fruit does the ascension of Christ into heaven bring us?

Ans. First, that he Heb 7.14. 1 John 2.3. Romans 8.34.
makes intercession to his Father in heaven for us. Next, that we have our
flesh in heaven, that we may be confirmed thereby, as by a sure pledge, that it
shall come to pass, that he who is our head, will John 14.2. Ephe. 2.6.
lift up us his members unto him. Thirdly, that he John 14.16. 2 Cor. 1.22. 1
Cor. 5.5.
sends us his spirit in steed of a pledge between him and us, by whose
forcible working we seek after, not earthly, but heavenly things, where he
himself is sitting at the right hand of God Col 3.1. Phil. 3.20.


50. Quest. Why is it further said, He sits at the right hand of God?

Ans. Because Christ therefore is ascended into heaven, to Ephe. 1.20. Col.
1.18.
show there that he is the head of the Church, by whom the Father Mat. 28.18.
John 5.22.
governs all things.

What profit is this glory of our head Christ unto us?

Ans. First, that through his holy spirit, he Ephe. 4.10.
pours upon us his members, heavenly graces. Then, that he shieldeth and
Psalm. 2.9. Romans 8.23. Phil. 3.20.
defends us by his power against all our enemies.

What comfort have thou by the coming again of Christ to judge the quick and
the dead?

Ans. That in all my miseries and persecutions, Luk 21.28. Romans 8.23.24 Phil.
3.20.
I look, with my head lifted up, for the very same, who before yielded
himself unto the judgment of God for me, and 2 These. 1.6.7 Mat. 25.41.
took away all malediction from me, to come judge from heaven, to throw all
his and my enemies into everlasting pains, but to Mat. 25.34.
translate me with all his chosen, unto him self, into celestial joys, and
everlasting glory.

OF THE HOLY GHOST.
What beleevest thou concerning the holy ghost?

Ans. First, that he is true and coeternall God with the eternal father and
the Genesis 1.2. Isa. 48.16. 1 Cor. 3.16.
son: Secondly, that he is also Mat. 28.19 2 Cor. 1.2.
given unto me to Gal. 3.14. 1 Pet. 1.2.
make me through a true faith, partaker of Christ and all his benefits, to
Acts 9.31.
comfort me, and to John 16. 1 Pet. 4.14.
abide with me for ever.

What beleevest thou concerning the holy and catholic Church of Christ?

Ans. I believe that the son of Iho. 10.11.
God does from Genesis 26.4.
the beginning of the world Romans 8.29. Ephe. 1.10.
to the end, gather, defend and Isa. 59.21.
preserve unto him self by his spirit, and Act. 2.46.
word out of whole mankind, Mat. 16.18.
a company 1 John 3.21
chosen to everlasting life, and agreeing in true faith: and that I am a lively
1 Ioh. 2.19.
member of that company, and so shall 1 Cor. 8 9. Romans 8.35.
remain for ever.

55. Quest. What mean these words, The communion of Saints?

Ans. First, that all and every one, who believes, are in common John 1.3.
Romans 8.32. 1 Cor. 12.13.
partakers of Christ, and all his graces, as being his members. And then, that
every one ought readily and 1 Cor. 13.5. Phil. 2.4.5.6.
cheerfully to bestow the gifts and graces which they have received, to the
common commodity and safety of all.

56. Quest. What beleevest thou concerning remission of sins?

Ans. That God, for the satisfaction made by 1 John 2.2. 2 Cor. 5.19.
Christ, has put out all the remembrance Iere. 32.34. Psalm. 103.3. Romans 8.1.2.3
of my sins, and also of that corruption within me, wherewith I must fight
all my life time: and does freely endow me with the righteousness of Christ,
that John. 3.18.
I come not at any time into judgment.

What comfort have thou, by the resurrection of the flesh?

Ans. That not only my soul, after it shall depart out of my body, shall
presently be taken Luke 23.4. Phil. 1.23.
up to Christ, but that this my flesh also, being raised up by the power of
Christ, shall be again united to my soul, and shall be 1. Cor. 15. Job 19.25.
made like to the glorious body of Christ.

58. Quest. What comfort take thou of the article of everlasting life?

Ans. That for as much as 2 Cor 5.2.3
I feel already in my heart the beginning of everlasting life, it 1 Cor. 2.9.
John 17.37.
shall at length come to pass, that after this life I shall enjoy full and
perfect bliss, wherein I may magnify God forever; which blessedness verily,
neither eye has seen, nor ear has heard, neither has any man in thought
conceived it.

But when thou beleevest all these things, what profit redoundeth thence unto
thee?

Ans. That I am righteous in Christ before God, an an heir of eternal life
Heb. 2.4. Romans 1.17. John 3.36.
.

60. Que. How art thou righteous before God?

Ans. Only Romans 3.21. etc Gal 2.16 Ephe. 2.8, 9.
by faith in Christ Jesus: so that, although my conscience accuse me, that I
have grievouslie trespassed against all the commandments of God, and have not
Romans 3.9. etc.
kept one of them: and further, am as yet Romans 7.23
prone to all evil: yet notwithstanding (if I Romans 3.42. John 3.18.
embrace these benefits of Christ with a true confidence and persuasion of
mind, the full and Tit. 3.5 Ephe. 2.8.9.
perfect satisfaction, righteousness, and holiness of Christ, without any John
2.2.
merit of mine, of the mere Romans 3.24. Deuteronomy. 9.6.
mercy of God, is John 2.1.
imputed and Romans 4.4. 2 Cor. 5.19.
given unto me, and that so as if neither I had committed any sin, neither
any corruption did stick unto me yea as I my self had perfectly 1 Cor. 5.21.
accomplished that obedience, which Christ accomplished for me.

61. Quest. Why affirmest thou, that thou art made righteous by faith only?

Ans. Not for that I please God through the worthiness of mere faith: but
because only the satisfaction, righteousness and holiness of Christ is my
righteousness before 1 Cor. 1.33. 1 Cor. 2.2.
God: and I cannot take hold of it 1 Ioh. 5.10.
or apply it unto my self any other way than by faith.

Why cannot our good works be righteousness, or some part of righteousness
before God?

Ans. Because that righteousness which must stand fast before the judgment
of God, must be in all points perfect, and Gal. 3.10. Deuteronomy. 27.26.
agreeable to the Law of God. Now our works, even the best of them, are
imperfect in this life, and Esa. 64.
defiled with sin.

63. Quest. How is it that our good works merit nothing, seeing God promises
that he will give a reward for them, both in this life, and in the life to
come?

Ans. That reward is not given of merit, but of Luke 17.10.
grace.

64. Quest. But does not this doctrine make men careless and profane?

Ans. No: For neither can it be, but they, which are incorporated into Christ
thorough faith, should bring forth the fruits of Mat. 7.18. John 15.5.
thankefulnes.

OF THE SACRAMENTS.
Seeing then that only faith makes us partakers of Christ and his benefits,
whence does it proceed?

Ans. From the holy ghost, who Ephe. 28. and 6.23. Phil. 1.29.
kindles it in our hearts by the preaching of the gospel, and Mat. 28.19. 2
Pet. 1.22.
confirms it by the use of the Sacraments.

66. Quest. What are the Sacraments?

Ans. They are sacred signs and seals set before our eyes, and ordained of
God for this cause, that he may declare and seal by them the promise of his
Gospel unto us, to wit, that he gives freely remission of sins, and Genesis
17.11. Romans 4.11. Deuteronomy. 30.6. Levi. 6.25. Isa. 6.6.
life everlasting not only to all in general, but to every one in particular
that believes, for that only sacrifice of Christ which he accomplished upon
the cross.

67. Quest. Do not then both the word and sacraments tend to that end, as to
lead our faith unto the sacrifice of Christ finished on the cross, as to the
only ground of our salvation?

Ans. It is even so. For the holy ghost teaches us by the gospel, and
assures us by the Sacraments, that the salvation of all of us, stands in the
holy sacrifice of Christ Romans 6.3. Gal. 3.27.
offered for us upon the cross.

68. Quest. How many Sacraments has Christ ordained in the new Testament?

Ans. Two. Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

OF BAPTISM.
How art thou admonished and assured in Baptism, that thou art partaker of the
only sacrifice of Christ?

Ans. Because Christ Mat. 28.19. Acts 2.38.
commanded the outward washing of water, adjoining this Mar. 16.16. Mat. 3.11.
Romans 6.3.
promise thereunto, that I am no less assuredly washed by his blood and spirit
from the uncleanness of my soul, that is, from all my sins, than I am Mar.
1.14. Luc. 3.3.
washed outwardly with water, whereby all the filthiness of the body uses to
be purged.

70. Quest. What is it to be washed with the blood and spirit of Christ?

Ans. It is to receive of God forgivenes of sins freely for the blood of
Christ, which he Heb. 12.24. 1 Pet. 1.2. Apoc. 1.5.
shed for us in his Sacrifice on, the cross. And also to be renewed by the holy
Ghost, and through his sanctifying of us, to become members of Christ, that we
may more and more die to sin, and John 1.33. Romans 6.4. Col. 2.12.
live holy and without blame.

71. Quest. Where does Christ promise us that he will as certainly wash us
with his blood and spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?

Ans. In the institution of Baptism; the words whereof are these: Mat. 28.19.
Go and teach all Nations, Baptising them in the name of the father, the
son, and the holy Ghost, Mat. 16.16.
He that shall beleve and be baptized, shall be saved: but he that will not
believe, shall be damned.

This promise is repeated again, whereas the scripture calls Baptism, the
Tit. 3.5.
washing of the new bith, and Act. 22.16.
forgiveness of sins.

Is then the outward Baptism of water the washing away of sins?

Ans. It is not. For the Mat. 3.11. 1 Pet. 3.11.
blood of Christ alone cleanses from all 1 John 1.7. 1 Cor. 6.11.
sin.

73. Quest. Why then does the holy ghost call Baptism the washing of the new
birth, and forgivenes of sins?

Ans. God speaks so not without great cause; to wit, not only to teach us,
that as the filth of our body is purged by water, so our sins also are Apoc.
1.5. 1 Cor. 6.11.
purged by the blood and spirit of Christ: but much more to assure as by this
divine token and pledge, that we are as verily washed from our sins with the
inward washing, as we are Mat. 16.16. Gal. 3.17.
washed by the outward and visible water.

Quest. Are infants to be baptized also?

Ans. What else: For seeing they Genesis 17.7.
belong as well unto the covenant and church of God, as they who are of a full
age, and seeing also unto them is promised Mat. 19.14
remission of sins by the blood of Christ, and the Luke 1.14. Psalm. 22.11. Act.
2.39.
holy ghost the worker of faith, as well as unto those of full growth. They are
by baptism to be ingrafted into the Church of God, and to be discerned from
the children of infidels, Act. 10.47.
in like sort as in the old Testament was done by Genesis 17.14
circumcision, in place whereof Colos. 2.11.12.13.
Baptism succeeded in the new Testament.

OF THE LORDS SVPPER.
How art thou in the Lords Supper admonished and waranted, that thou art
partaker of that only sacrifice of Christ offered partaker of that only
sacrifice of Christ offered on the Cross, and of all his benefits?

Ans. Because Christ has commanded me and all the faithful, to eat of this
bread broken, and to drink of the cup distributed in remembrance of him, with
this promise Mat. 26.27. Mar 14.22. Luke 22.16. 1 Cor. 10.16.
adjoined: First, that his body was as certainly broken and offered for me on
the Cross, and his blood shed for me, as I behold with my eyes the bread of
the Lord broken unto me, and the cup communicated to me: and further, that my
soul is no less assuredly fed to everlasting life with his body, which was
crucified for us, and his blood, which was shed for us; than I receive and
taste by the mouth of my body the bread and wine, the signs of the body and
blood of our Lord, received at the hand of the Minister.

76. Quest. What is it to eat the body of Christ crucified, and to drink his
blood that was shed?

Ans. It is not only to embrace by an assured confidence of mind, the whole
passion and death of Christ, and there by to John 6.35.40.47.48.
obtain forgivenes of sins and everlasting life, but also by the holy ghost,
who dwells both in Christ and us, so more and more to be John 6.56.
united to his sacred body, that though he be in Acts 3.21. 1 Cor. 11.26.
heaven, and we in earth, yet nevertheles are we flesh of his flesh, and bone
of his Ephe. 5.29. 1 Cor. 6.15. 1 John 3.24.
bones; and as all the members of the body are by one soul, so are we also
quickened and John 6.56. Ephe. 4.15.
guided by one and the same spirit.

77. Quest. Where has Christ promised that he will as certainly give his body
and blood so to be eaten and drunken, as they eat this bread broken, and drink
this cup?

Ans. In the institution of his Supper, the words whereof are these: 1 Cor.
11.23 Mat 26.26. Mar. 14.22.
Our Lord Jesus Christ in the night that he was betrayed, took bread: and when
he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat, this is my body which
is broken for you: this do you in remembrance of me. Likewise also be took
the cup when he had supped, and said, Exodus 24.8. Heb. 9.20.
This cup is the new Testament in my blood: Exodus 13.9.
this do as often as ye shall drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as
ye shall eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye show the Lords death till he
come. This promise is repeated by Saint Paul when he says: The cup of
thankesgiving, wherewith we give thanks, is it not the communion of the blood
of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? 1 Cor. 10.16.17.
For we that are many, are one bread and one body, because we all are partakers
of one bread.

Are then the bread and wine made the very body and blood of Christ?

Ans. No verily. But as the water of baptism is Mat. 26.29 Mar. 14.24.
not turned into the blood of Christ, but is only a sign and pledge of those
things that are sealed to us in baptism: so neither is the bread of the Lords
supper the very body of 1 Cor. 10 16 etc. and 11.26
Christ: Although according to the manner of Sacraments, and that Genesis 17.10.
Exodus 26.27. Acts 7.8. Levit. 16.10.
form of speaking of them which is usual unto the holy Ghost, the bread is
called the body of Christ.

79 Quest. Why then does Christ call bread his body, and the cup his blood, or
the new Testament in his blood: and Paul also calls bread and wine, the
communion of the body and blood of Christ?

Ans. Christ not without great consideration speaks so: to wit, not only for
to teach us, that as the bread and wine sustain the life of the body, so also
his crucified body and bloodshed are in deed the meat and drink of the soul,
whereby it is John 6.51.55.56.
nourished to eternal life: but much more, that by this visible sign and
pledge he may assure us, that we are as verily partakers of his body and
blood, through the working of the holy ghost, as we do 1 Cor. 13.6.
receive by the mouth of our body these holy signs in remembrance of him: and
further also, that his suffering and obedience is so certainly ours, as though
we our selves had suffered punishment for our sins, and had satisfied God.

What difference is there between the supper of the Lord, and the popish Mass?

Ans. The Supper of the Lord testifies to us that we have perfect forgivenes
of all our sins for that only sacrifice of Christ, which him self once fully
Heb. 7.27. and 9.12.26. Mat 26.28. Luke 22.19.
wrought on the cross: Then also that we by the holy Ghost are graffed into
Christ, who now according to his humane nature is only in heaven at the right
hand of his 1 Cor. 6.17. and 10.16.
Father, and there will be Heb. 1.3. and 8.1, etc.
worshipped of us, But in the Mass it is denied, that the quick and the dead
have remission John 4.21. Col. 3.1. Phil. 3.10.
of sins for the only passion of Christ, except also Christ be daily offered of
them by their sacrificers. Further also it is taught, that Christ is bodily
under the form of bread and wine, and therefore is to be In canon^ Missae:
item de consecrat. distinct. 2.
worshipped in them. And so the very foundation of the Mass is nothing else
than an utter denial of that only sacrifice and passion of Christ Jesus, and
an accursed idolatry.

81. Quest. Who are to come unto the Table of the Lord?

Ans. They only who are truly sorrowful, that they have offended God by their
sins; and yet trust that those sins are pardoned them for Christ's sake: and
what other infirmity they have, that those are covered by his passion and
death, who also desire more and more to go forward in faith and integrity of
life. But hypocrites, and they who do not truly repent, do eat and 1 Cor.
10.2^ and 11.28.
drink damnation to themselves.

82. Quest. Are they also to be admitted to this supper, who in confession and
life declare them selves to be infidels and ungodly?

Ans. No. For by that means the covenant of God is profaned, and the wrath of
God is 1 Cor. 10.21. Isa. 1.11. Ierem. 7.21.
stirred up against the whole assembly. Wherefore the Church by the
commandment of Christ and his Apostles, using the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, ought to drive them from this supper, till they shall repent and change
their manners.

What are the keys of the kingdom of heaven?

Ans. Preaching of the Gospel, and Ecclesiastical discipline: by which heaven
is opened to the believers: and is Mat. 16.19. and 18.18.
shut against the unbelievers.

84. Quest, How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut by the preaching of
the gospel?

Ans. When by the commandment of Christ it is publicly declared to all and
every one of the faithful, that all their sins are pardoned them of God, for
the merit of Christ, so often as they embrace by a lively faith the promise of
the Gospel: but contrarily is denounced to all infidels and hypocrites, that
so long the wrath of God and everlasting damnation does lie on them, as they
John 20.21.22.2.3. Man. 16.19.
persist in their wickedness: according to which testimony of the Gospel, God
will judge them as well in this life, as in the life to come.

85. Quest. How is the kingdom of heaven opened and shut, by Ecclesiastical
discipline?

Ans. When according to the commandment of Christ, they who in name are
christians, but in their doctrine and life, show them selves Romans 11.7.8.9. 1
Cor. 12 28.
aliens from Christ, after they having been sometime admonished, will not
depart from their errors or wickedness, are made known unto the Church, or to
them that are appointed for that matter, and purpose of the Church: and if
neither then they obey their admonition, are of the same men by interdiction
from the Sacraments shutt out from the Congregation of the Church, and by God
him self, out of the kingdom of heaven: And again, if they profess and in
deed declare amendment of life, are Mat. 18.15. 1 Cor. 5.3.4. 2 These. 3.14. 1 Timothy 5.17.
receyved as members of Christ and his Church.

THE THIRD PART, OF MAN'S THANKFVLNES.


When as we are delivered from all our sins and miseries without any merit of
ours, by the mercy of God only for Christ's sake: for what cause are we to do
good works?

Answer.

BEcause, after that Christ has redeemed us with his blood, he renueth us
also by his spirit to the image of himself: that we receiving so great
benefits, should show our selves all our life time Romans 6.13. and 12.1.2. 1
Pet. 2.5.
Thankful to God, and Mat. 5.16. 1 Per. 2.12.
honor him. Secondly, that every of us may be 2. Pe^. 1.10. Gal. 5.6.
assured of his faith, by his fruit. And lastly, that by our honest and good
conversation, we may 1. Pet. 3.1. 2 Matt. 5.16. Romans 14.19.
win others unto Christ.

87. Quest. Can not they then be saved, which be unthankful, and remain
still carelessly in their sins, and are not converted from their wickedness
unto God?

Ans. By no means. For, as the scripture bears witness, neither unchaste
persons, nor Idolaters, nor adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous men, nor
drunkards, nor slaunderers, nor robbers, shall 1. Cor. 6.9. Ephe. 5.5. 1 John
3.14.
enter into the kingdom of God.

Of what parts consists the conversion of men unto God?

Ans. It consists of the Romans 6.4. Ephe. 4.22. Col. 3.5. 1 Cor. 5.7.
mortifying of the old man, and the quickening of the new man.

89. Quest. What is the mortifying of the old man?

Ans. To be truly and heartily sorry, that thou have offended God by thy sins,
and daily more and more to hate and Romans 8.13. Joel. 2*13.
eschew them.

90. Quest. What is the quickening of the new man?

Ans. True joy in God through Romans 5.1. and 14.17 Isa. 57.15.
Christ, and an earnest and ready desire to order thy life according to Gods
will, and to do Romans 6.10. Gal. 2.20.
all good works.

91. Quest. What are good works?

Ans. Those only which are done by a true Romans 14.23
faith, according to 1 Samuel 15.22 Ephe. 2.10.
Gods law, and 1 Cor. 10.3^
are referred only to his glory: and not those which are imagined by us, as
seeming to us to be right and good, or which are Deuteronomy. 11.32. Eze. 20.18. Mat.
15.9.
delivered and commanded by men.

92. Quest. Which is the Law of God?

Ans. God spoke all Exodus ^0.1.2.3 Deuteronomy. 5.6.7.
these words:

1. I am the Lord thy God, Exe 20
which has brought thee out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, thou shall
have no other gods in my sight. 2. Thou shall make to thee no graven Image, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor
in the water under the earth. Thou shall not bow down to them, nor worship
them: for I the Lord thy God, am a ielous God, and visit the sins of the
fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
hate me, and show mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
commandments. 3. Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain:
for the Lord will not hold him guiltles that takes his name in vain. 4. Deu.
5.12.
Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day, six days shall thou labor and do
all, that thou have to do, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God, in it thou shall do no manner of works, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, thy man servant, and thy maidservant, thy cattle, and the stranger
that is within thy gate. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the
sea, and all that in them is, and reasted the seventh day: Wherefore the Lord
blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it. 5. Honor thy Father and thy Mother,
that thy days may be long in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
6. Thou shall do no murder. 7. Thou shhalt not commit adultery. 8. Thou
shall not steal. 9. Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
10. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors house, nor his wife, nor his servant,
nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is his.
How are the commandments divided?

Ans. Into two Exodus 34.28 Deuteronomy. 4.13. and 10.34.
tables, whereof the former delivers in four commandments, how we ought
to behave our selves toward God: The latter delivers in six commanndements,
what duties we a owe unto our neighbor.

94. Quest. What does God require in the first commandment?

Ans. That, as dearly as I render the salvation of my own soul, so
earnestly should I shun and fly all 1 Cor 6.9.10 and 10.7.14
Idolatry, sorcerie, enchantements, Levi. 19.31. Deuteronomy. 18.21.
superstition, praying to saints, or any other Mat. 4.12. Apo. 19.10.
creatures: and should rightly John 17.3.
acknowledge the only and true God Iere. 17.5.
, trust in him alone, Heb. 10.36. Col. 1.11. Romans 5.3.4. Phil. 2.14.
submitt and subject my self unto him with all 1 Pet. 5*5.6.
humility and patience, Psa. 104.27. Isa. 45.7. Iac. 1.17.
look for all good things from him alone, and lastly, with the entire
affection of my heart Deuteronomy. 6.5. Mat. 22.37.
love, Deuteronomy. 6. Mat 10.28.
reverence, and Mat. 4.20. Deuteronomy. 10.20.
worship him: so that I am ready to renounce and forsake all creatures rather,
then to Mat. 5.29.
commit the least thing that may be against his will.

95. Quest. What is Jdolatrie?

Ans. It is, in place of that one God, or besides that one and true God, who
has manifested him self in his word, to make or imagine, and account any
other thing, wherein thou reposest thy 1 Para. 16. Phil. 3.19. Gal. 4.8. Ephe.
2.12.
hope and confidence.

Mat. 22.37.38.39.
What does the second commandment require?

Ans. That we should not Deuteronomy. 4.15. Isa. 40.18. Romans 1. Acts 17.19.
express or represent God by any image, or shape and figure, or 1 Samuel 15.
Deuteronomy. 12.30.
worship him any otherwise than he has commanded in his word him self to be
worshipped.

97. Quest. May there then at all any images or resemblances of things be made?

Ans. God neither ought nor can be represented by any means: and for the
creatures, although it be lawful to express them, yet God forbids
notwithstanding their images to be made or had, as thereby to worship or Exodus
23.24 and 34.13.14. Number. 33.52. Deuteronomy. 7.5.
honor either them, or God by them.

But may not images be tolerated in Churches, which may serve for books unto
the common people?

Ans. No. For it is not seemly that we should be wiser than God, who will
have his Church to be 2 Timothy 3.16. 2 Pet. 1.19.
taught with the livelie preaching of his word, and not with dum be Ier. 10.8.
etc Hab. 2.18.19.
images.

What does God decree in the third commandment?

Ans. That not only by cursing, or Lev. 24.11. and 19.2.
forswearing, but also by Mat. 5.37. Iac. 5.12.
rash swearing we should not use his name despitefully or vnreverently:
neither should by silence or connivence be pertakers of those horrible sins
in others.: But that we Isa. 45.4.
use the sacred and holy name of God ever with great devotion and reverence:
that he may be 1 Timothy 2.8.
worshipped and honored by us with a true and steadfast Romans 2.24. 1 Timothy 6.1.
Col. 3.16.17.
confession, and Mat. 10.32.
invocation of his name: and lastly in all our words and actions whatsoever.

100. Quest. Js it then so grievous a sin by swearing or banning, to take the
name of God in vain, as that God is also angry with them, who, as much as in
them lies, do not forbid or hinder it?

Ans. Surely most Levit. 5.1.
grievous. For neither is there any sin greater, or more offending God, than
the despiting of his sacred name. Wherefore also he Lev. 24.15.
would have this sin to be punished with death.

May a man swear also religiously and lawfully by the name of God?

Ans. He may: when as either the Magistrate exacteth it, or otherwise
necessity requires by this means the faith and truth of any man or thing to
be ratified and established: whereby both the glory of God may be advanced,
and the safety of others procured. For this kind of swearing is Deuteronomy 6.13.
Heb. 6.16.
ordained by Gods word, and therefore was well Genesis 21.24. Ios. 5.15.19. 1 Samuel 24.22.
used of the Fathers both in the old, and new Testament.

102. Quest. Is it lawful to swear by Saints, or other creatures?

Ans. No: For a lawful oath is an invocation of God, A^^u. 20. and 17.10 and
20.12. Psalm. 7.9. Reu. 2.13.
whereby we desire, that he, as the only searcher of hearts, bear witness unto
the truth, and punish the swearer, if he wittingly 2 Cor. 1.23.
swear falsely. But this honor Mat. 5.34.35
agrees to no creature.

What does God command in the fourth commandment?

Ans. First, that the ministry of the Gospel, and the schools of learning
should be Fit. 1.15. 1 Timothy 3.14. 1 Cor. 9.11. 2 Timothy 1.2.
maintained: and that I, especially on the Sabbath, Psalm. 86.26. and 40.9.10.
Acts 2.42.46.
frequent studiously divine assemblies: 1 Cor. 14 19 29.31.
hear the word of God dilige^tlie; use the 1 Cor. 11.33
Sacraments: 1 Timothy 1.1.2.3.8.9. 1 Cor. 14.16.
join my prayers with the common prayers of the assembly: and bestow
something according to my ability, 1 Cor. 26.
on the poor. And further, that all my life time I be free from misdeedes and
evil actions, yielding unto the Lord, that he may by his holy spirit work in
me his work: and so I may Isa. 66.23.
begin in this life that everlasting Sabbath.

What does God enioine us in the sift commandment?

Ans. That we yield due honor, love, and faithfulness to our Parents, and so
to all, who bear rule over us, and Ephe. 6.1.2. etc Col. 3.18. Ephe. 5.2. Romans
13.1.
submit our selves with such obedience, as is meet, to their faithful
commandementes, and chastisementes: And further also, that by our patience we
Pro. 23.21. 1 Pet. 2.18.
bear and suffer their vices and manners, ever thinking with our selves, that
God will Ephe 6.4.9. Col. 3.19.21. Romans 13. Mat. 22.27.
govern and guide us by their hand.

105. Quest. What does God exact in the sixth commandment?

Ans. That neither in thought, nor in gesture, much less indeed, I reproach or
hate, or harm, or Mat. 5.12. Genesis 9.6. Mat. 26.52.
kill my neighbor, either by my self, or by another: but Ephe. 4.26. Romans
12.19. Mat. 5.25.
cast away all desire of revenge. Furthermore, that I Romans 13.14. Col. 2.23.
hurt not my self, or cast my self wittinglie into any danger. Wherefore
also, that murders might not be committed, he has Genesis 9.6. Mat. 26.52. Romans
13.4.
armed the Magistrate with the sword.

But this commandment seems to forbid murder only?

Ans. But in forbidding murder, God does further teach that he hates the
root and cause of murder, to wit, Iae 1.20. Gal. 5.20.
anger, Romans 1.29.
envy, 1 John 2.9.
hatred, and desire of revenge, and does 1 John 3.15^
account them all for murder.

107. Quest. Is it enough then, that we kill no man in such sort as has been
said?

Ans. It is not enough: For when God condemns anger, envy, hatred, he
requires that we Mat. 22.39. and 1.12.
love our neighbor as our selves, and that we use Rom 12.10
humanity, lenity, courtesy, Ephe. 4.2. Gal. 6.1.2. Mat. 5.5. Romans 12.18.
patience, and Exodus 23.5.
mercy toward him, and Mat. 5.45.
turn away from him, as much as we may, whatsoever may be hurtful unto him.
In a word, that we be so affected in mind, as that we Romans 12.20
stick not to do good also unto our enemies.

What is the meaning of the seventh commandment?

Ans. That God has in Lev. 18.27.
execration, all turpitude, and filthiness, and therefore we also must Iud.
22.13.
utterly hate and detest it, and contrariwise live temperately, modestly, and
1 These. 4.3.
chastely, whether we Heb. 13.4. 1 Cor. 7.4.
live in holy wedlock, or in single life.

109. Quest. Forbids God nothing else in this commandment, but adultery,
and such kinds of uncleanness?

Ans. Seeing both our body and soul are the temples of the holy ghost, 1 Cor.
3.16. and 6.19. 2 Cor. 6.16.
God will have us to possess both in purity and holiness. And therefore
deeds, gestures, Ephe. 5.3. 1 Cor. 6.18.
words, thoughts, Mat. 5.27.
filthy lusts, and whatsoever entiseth a man unto these, all that he wholly
Ephe. 5.18. 1 Cor. 15.33.
forbids.

What does God forbid in the eight commandment?

Ans. Not only those 1 Cor. 6.10.
theftes, and 1 Cor. 5.10.
robberies which the Magistrate punishes: but by the name of theft, he
comprehends whatsoever evil crafts, fetches and devises, whereby we seek
after other men's goods, and endeavor by force, or with some show of right, to
Luc. 3.14. 1 These. 4.6.
convey them over unto our selves: of which sort are; false Pro. 11.1.
weights, false elns, uneven Ezec. 45.9. Deuteronomy. 25.13.
measures, deceitful merchandise, counterfeit coin, Psalm. 15.5. Luc. 6.35.
usury, or any other way or means of furthering our estate, which God has
forbidden. To these we may add all 1 Cor. 6.10.
covetousnes: and the manifold wast and abusing of Gods gifts.

What are those things, which God here commands?

Ans. That to my power I help and further the commodities and profit of my
neighbor: and that I so deal with him, as I would Pro. 5.16.
desire to be dealth with my self: and that I do my own work painfully, and
faithfully, that I Mat. 7.12.
may thereby help others also who are distressed with any need or calamity.

112. Quest. What does the ninth commandment exact?

Luke 10.27. man. 12.31.
Ans. That I bear no false Pro. 19.5.6. and 21.28.
witness against any man, neither Psalm. 13.3.
falsify any man's words, neither backbite or Romans 1.29.
reproach any man, nor Ma. 7.1. etc. Luke. 6.37.
condemn any man rashly or unheard, but avoid and John 8.44.
shun with all carfulness all kind of lies, and deceit, as the Pro.
12.22. and 13.5.
proper works of the devil: except I mean to stir up against me the most
greevous wrath of God. And that in judgments and other affairs I follow the
truth, and freely and constantly 1 Cor. 13.6. Ephe 4 25.
profess the matter as it in deed is: And moreover defend and 1 Pet. 5.8.
increase, as much as in me lies, the good name and estimation of others.

What does the tenth commandment forbid?

Ans. That our hearts be not at any time moved by the least desire, or
cogitation, against any commandment of God: but that continually and from
our heart, we detest all sin, and contrarily, Romans 7.7 etc
delight in all righteousness.

114. Quest. But can they, who are converted unto God, perfectly observe and
keep these commandments?

Ans. No: But even the holiest men as long as they live, have only small
beginnings of this Romans 7.14.
obedience: yet so, that they Romans 7.22. Iac. 2.10.
begin with an earnest and unfeigned desire and endeavor to live not according
to some only, but according to all the commandments of God.

115. Quest. Why will God then have his Law to be so exactlie and severely
preached, seeing there is no man in this life, who is able to keep it?

Ans. First, that all our life time we more and more John 1.9. Psalm. 22.5.
acknowledge the great pronenes of our nature to sin, and so much the more
greedily Romans 7.24.
desire remission of sins, and righteousness in Christ: Secondly, that we be
1 Cor. 9.24. Phil. 3.12.13.14.
doing of this always: and always thinking of that, and implore and crave of
the Father the grace of his holy spirit, whereby we may daily more and more be
renewed to the image and likeness of God, until at length after we are
departed out of this life, we may joyfully attain unto that perfection which
is proposed unto us.

OF PRAYER.
Wherefore is Prayer necessary for Christians?

Ans. Because it is the chief part of that Psalm. 50.15.
thankfulness which God requires of us. And also because God gives them only
his grace and holy spirit, Romans 9.26.
who with unfeigned gronings, beg them continually of him, and Mat. 7.7.1.
Luke 11.9.13. Mar. 13.12.
yield him thanks for them.

117. Quest. What is required unto that prayer, which shall please God, and be
heard of him?

Ans. That we ask of the only true God, who has Ioh. 4.22.
manifested him self in his word, all things, which he has commanded to be
Romans 8.26. 1 John. 5.14.
asked of him with a true affection and desire of our heart, and through an
inward Ioh. 4.23.24 Psalm. 145.18.
feeling of our need and misery 2 Par. 20.12
cast our selves down prostrate in the presence of his divine majesty: and
Psalm. 2.11. and 39. Isa. 66.2.
build our selves on this sure foundation, that we, though unworthy, yet for
Christ's sake, are certainly Romans 10.14. and 8.15.16. Iac. 1.6. etc.
heard of God, eve^ as he has Io. 14.13. Dan. 9.17.18. Mat. 7.8. Psalm. 133.1.
promised us in his word.

118. Quest. What are those things, which he commands us to ask of him?

Ans. All Iac. 1.17. Mat. 6.33.
things necessary both for soul and body: which our Lord Jesus Christ has
comprised in that prayer, which him self has taught us.

119. Quest. What prayer is that? Ans. OUR Mat. 6.9.10.13 Luc. 11.2. etc. 3.4.
Mat. 7.9.
Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come: thy
will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us:
And lead us not into temptation: but deliver us from evil: for thine is the
kingdom, the power, and glory, for ever, and ever. AMEN.

Why does Christ teach us to call God our Father?

Ans. That presently in the very entrance and beginning of the prayer, he might
stir up in us such a reverence and confidence in God, as is meet for the sons
of God, which must be the ground and foundation of our prayer: to wit, that God
through Christ is made our Father, and will much less deny unto us those
things, which we ask of him with a true faith, than our earthly Parents
Mat. 7.9.10.11. Luke 11.11.
deny unto us earthly things.

121. Quest. Why is that added, which art in heaven?

Ans. That we Ier. 23.24. Acts 17.24.
conceive not basely or terrenely of Gods heavenly Majesty: And also that we
Romans 10.12.
look for and expect from his omnipotency, whatsoever things are necessary
for our soul and body. mat 6.9. luke 11.2


What is the first petition?

Ans. Hallowed be thy name: that is, grant us first to John 17.3. Ier.
9.23.24. Mat. 16.17. Iac. 1.5.
know thee aright, and to worship, praise, and Psalm. 119.137.138. Luke 1.46.
Psalm. 145.8.9.
magnify thy almightinesse, goodness, justice, mercy, and truth shyning in
all thy works. And further also, to direct our whole life, thoughts, words, and
works to this end, that thy most holy name be not reproched for us, but
rather be Psalm. 115.1. and 71.8. Mat 6.10
renowned with honor and praises.

What is the second petition?

Ans. Let thy kingdom come, that is, rule us so by thy word and spirit, that
we Mat. 6.33. Psalm. 119.5.
may humble and submit our selves more and more unto thee: preserve and
increase thy Psalm. 51.20.
Church; destroy the works of the devil, and all power that lifts up it
self against thy Majesty: make all those counsails frustrate and void which
are 1 John 3.8. Romans 16.20.
taken against thy word, until at length thou Apoc. 22.
reign fully and perfectly, when thou shall be all in 1 Cor. 15.28
all.

What is the third petition?

Ans. Thy will he done in earth, as it is in heaven: that is, grant that we
and all men renouncing and Mat. 16.24. Tit. 2.12.
forsaking our own will, may readily and without any Luke 22.42
grudging obey thy will, which is only holy: and that so every of us may
faithfully and cheerfullie 1 Cor. 7.24.
perform that duty and charge which thou have committed unto us, even as the
blessed Angels do in Psalm. 103.20
heaven.

What is the fourth petition?

Ans. Give us this day our daily bread: mat 6.11 Luk 16.3.
that is, give unto us all things which are Psalm. 145.15 Mat. 25. etc.
needful for this life, that by them we may acknowledge and confess thee to
be the only fountain, from whence all good things Acts 17.27.
flow, and all our care and industry, and even thine own gifts to be
unfortunate and 1 Cor. 53.53 Deuteronomy. 8.3. Psa. 27.16.17
noisome unto us, except thou bless them. Wherefore, grant that turning our
trust away from all creatures, we Psa. 62.11. and 55.23
place and repose it in thee alone.

What is the fifth petition?

Ans. Forgive us our trespasses, Luke 11.4
mat. 6.12.
as we forgive them that trespass against us: that is, Even for the blood of
Christ, do not Psalm. 51.1. 1 Ihon. 2.1.2.
impute unto us most miserable and wretched sinners, all our offenses, neither
that corruption, which still cleaves unto us: even as we also feel this
testimony of thy grace in our hearts, that we steadfastly purpose
vnfeignedlie from our heart, to Mat. 6.14.15.
pardon and forgive all those, who have offended us.

What is the sixth petition? Luke 11.4


Ans. Lead us not into temptation, mat. 6.13.
but deliver us from evil: that is, because we our selves are so feeble and
weak by nature, that we John 15.51. Psalm. 103.14
cannot stand so much as one moment or instant; and our most deadly enemies, 1
Pet. 5.1. Ephe 6.12.
satan, the John 15.1.
world, and our own Romans 7.23. Gal. 5.17.
flesh, do instantly oppugn and assault us: uphold thou us, and establish and
strengthen us by the might of thy spirit, that we may not in this spiritual
combat Mar. 26.41 Mar. 13.33.
yield as vanquished, but may so long stoutly withstand them, until at
length we 1 These. 3.13. and 5.23.
get the full and perfect victory.

128. Quest. How concludest thou this prayer?

Ans. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever, that is,
we ask and crave all these things of thee, because, seeing both thou art our
King, and art almighty; thou art both willing and able to Romans 10.11 2 Pet.
2.9.
give them all unto us. And these things we therefore ask, that out of them,
not to us, but unto thy holy Name, all glory may Ioh. 14.13. Psalm. 115.1. Ier.
33.8.9.
redound.

129. Quest. What means this particle, Amen?

Ans. That the thing is sure and out of doubt. For my prayer is much more
certainly heard of God, than I feel in my heart, that I unfeignedly 1 Cor.
1.20. ^ Tim. 2.13.
desire the same.

FINIS.
