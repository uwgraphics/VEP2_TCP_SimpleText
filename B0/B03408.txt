The Faithful Shepherd; Or, The Loves of Tommy and Nanny.
To a New Scotch Tune: Or, There was an a bonny young Lad, etc.




WHen Tommy became first a Lover,
his Nanny so fired every part,
That poor Tommy's eyes did discover
the Conquest she made of his heart:
Ah! Nanny, quoth he, be not cruel,
reverse that ill fate of your mind,
Who Nature ordained for a jewel,
should never be fair and unkind:
Ah! Nanny, quoth he etc,
Were all those plump smiling Graces,
that delicate supple white skin,
That seems to disoul in the Embraces,
and would force a Senick to Sin:
Were these my dear Nanny, bestowed thee
to keep a perverse peevish mind;
Or to bless thy dear Tommy that loves thee,
ah! never be fair and unkind:
Were these etc.
The hopes of those Ivory Pillows,
to repose my poor head on at night,
Secures me from all Fortunes Billows,
or ought that can Nature affright:
There Is nothing but Nanny can please me,
to Nanny my Soul is confined,
No, nothing but Nanny can ease me,
then Nanny dear Nanny be kind;
Then Is nothing etc.
In Nannys dear sight I have anguish,
which Blushes proclaim in my face,
And out of her sight I do languish,
to think who possesses my place:
Ah! Nanny, no more let me leave thee,
but both be together confined,
And of all my fears undeceive me,
and for ever for ever be kind:
Ah! Nanny, etc.
Ah! Nanny, you told me you loved me,
and bid me no more to tomplain,
And when I have sighed have reproved me,
and kissed me, and vowed it a Game,
You told me that Fortune should never
dispoyl what your Soul had designed,
That you would be Tommys for ever,
and for ever to Tommy be kind:
You told, etc.
Remember dear Nanny, you said it,
and called all the Gods to attest,
And blushing to think that you did it,
you laid your face close to my Breast:
Remember how dearly I blessed ye,
and begged never to alter your mind,
Remember how often you kissed me,
and vowed you would always be kind:
Remember how etc,
But now cruel Nanny has left me,
and owns me no more for her own,
And of all my joys has bereft me,
and turned all my hopes to despair:
That Nanny that once had so loving:
obliedging, so gentle a mind,
That Nanny of all Creatures moving,
Is now perjured, false, and unkind;
That Nanny, etc.
What though my dear Nanny be cruel,
and nothing her fancy can move,
Yet Nanny must still be my jewel,
and all that my Soul can love:
Perhaps it is no alter of Nature,
bu only for Reasons Confined,
So lovely so pretty a Creature,
can never prove false and unkind.
FINIS.
