The Unhappy Marriage, OR, A Warning to Covetous Parents. Being a True Relation
of the Dismal Effects of Forced Wedlock, A New Play SONG.
See Parents when that you your Children force
Against their Wills, to turn Love from it is Course;
The Stream will soon return with greater Rage,
And soon you will see the folly of your Age;
And grieve to think what Rashly you have done,
When Ruin is by that means hurried on.
To the pleasant New Tune of, Jenny she was a Wanton Lass; or, Martellus.





JENNY she was a Wanton Girl,
and kept her Fathers Sheep,
Yet Jockey though a homely Churl,
would fain with Jenny Sleep;
Geud Faith he came to Court a good,
but Jenny would not say,
And do poor Iockey what he could,
still Jenny cried O Nay.
He felt her with his hard rough hand,
and often strove to Smouch her,
But Jenny made him off to stand,
and would not let him touch her:
For Jenny at defiance stood,
though Jockey much did say,
And do poor Iockey what he could,
still Ienny cried O Nay.
He many times aloud did sigh,
and Chestnuts did present her,
And in his Plad and Bonnet blithe,
strove all for to content her:
But that the Lass in her mad mood,
would not Loves power obey,
For do poor Iockey what he could,
still Ienny cried O Nay.




He gave her often Curds and Cream,
and These from off the shelf,
And did as often lead her home,
to proffer her himself:
And sighing often Jockey would
have Lead to Kirk the way,
But do poor Iockey what he could,
still Jenny cried O Nay.
In vain you sue Sweet Jenny cried,
what e're you do is vain,
Another must lie by my side,
it is so I Will tell you plain:
I Will tell you plain I Will lovh a good,
but it is not you I Will say,
And do poor Iockey what he could,
yet Jenny did say nay.
Then Jockey to her Father went,
to see what he could do,
And told him plainly what he meant,
how his poor heart did rue:
Cause Ienny was unkind he said
he over the world would Stray,
For do alas what e're he could,
Yet Ienny she said nay.
He offered House and Land and all,
With many Geud Geuds more,
So Jenny to his Lot might fall,
she never should be poor:
With this temptation here he sped,
and Jenny must obey,
And though at Kirk they soon were Wed,
yet Jennys heart said nay.
On Jockey she would no fancy set,
though he did buss and Clip her,
She still did wish they never had met,
though he fall brave did keep her:
No Love for Jockey e're she had,
her thoughts else where obey,
In spite of all poor Iockey could,
fair Jenny went astray.
For why a Lusty Lad she loved,
Tall Sawny he by Name,
Fair Jenny often after proved,
unto her Fathers shame:
Who cursing the unlucky Mood,
that made him first give way,
Poor Jenny against her will to Wed,
and make her go astray.
Did pine himself full soon to death,
and Jockey grieved likewise,
A Hempen Noose puts over his head,
and like a Woodcock dies;
Then Parents in no cruel Mood,
force Children to obey,
In Loves great cause it is not good,
to force when they say nay.
FINIS.
