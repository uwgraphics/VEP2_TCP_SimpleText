To the Right Honorable the Lords and others of the Committee of Estates, The
humble Remonstrance and Supplication of the Officers of the Army.
BEing sensible of the imputation laid upon the Kingdom and Army as if they
espoused the Malignant quarrel and interest, And considering that at this time
we are more specially concerned in it then others, being in the Lords strength
to take our lives in our hands and hazard all that is dear unto us by engaging
against this present enemy, who in an hostile wayhath invaded this Kingdom
contrary to all bonds of Covenant and Treaties. We conceive it our dut^e To
make it manifest to your honors and all the world, That we do not own any
malignant quarrel or interest of any person or persons whatsoever; But that by
the assistance of the Lord we do resolve to fight merely upon the former
grounds and principles in defense of the Cause, Covenant, and Kingdom, as has
been done these years bypast, (as the Commission of the Church and your
Lordships have declared in the late Act of the 13. of August,) Wherefore that
it may appear to all whose eyes are upon your Honors, That your performances
are suitable to your resolutions We in all humility desire (it being notour,
That scandalous and malignant persons not only abound in the Kingdom, but to
our great grief of spirit in and about the court, yea even in the Kings own
family and guard) That your honors will be pleased to take some speedy and
effectual course to put the laws of the Kingdom to full execution against
them without respect of persons, That all of them may find the dint of justice
acccording to their several offenses and miscarrages, so that this Kingdom
do not become the place and receptacle of all profane and malignant persons
who has been and are enemies to GOD and his Cause, and that God be no more
provoked by countenancing or spari^g of them, least the Lord should desert us
and cause us partake with them in their judgments.

And what yet remains in the Army undone in relation to purging, we desire
your honors would command your further pleasure therein, which shall have our
hearty con^urrance and assistance; all which being speedily and effectually
done, we are hopeful will prove a means to cause the Lords face shine up on
us, and countenance and bless us in our undertakings, And will very much
refresh the hearts and strengthen the hands of your Lordships most faithful
and humble servants.

EDINBURGH, 15. August, 1650.
THE Committee of Estates having taken into consideration the Remonstrance of
the officers of the Army, Presented unto them by the Lord Burleigh, the General
of Artillery General Major Holburne, Sir John Brown, and Collonell Gilbert
Ker, in name of the Army, do bless the Lord for their unanimous sense and
Resolution therein expressed against the Enemies of the cause of God both
Malignants and Sectaries, for which as they do return them the hearty thanks
of this Kingdom, So they earnestly exhort them steadfastly to persist therein,
And for answer to the desires contained in the said Remonstrance, They do
promise and declare that they will speedily take an effectual course for
putting the Laws of the Kingdom to full execution against all Scandalous and
Malignant persons in Court, Army, or Kingdom, without respect of Persons, And
that they will carefully study so to make use of the power which God has put
in their hands for advancement of piety and suppressing of Malignants and
profaneness as may give unto the Army real ground of incou agement cheerfully
to proceed in all their undertakings against the Army of Sectaries who have
invaded this Kingdom, and all other Enemies to the Covenant and work of
Reformation.
