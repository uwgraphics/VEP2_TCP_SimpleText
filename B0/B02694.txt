Diddle, Diddle.
Or, The Kind Country Lovers.
With sly insinuations he persuades her
And by the bands of Love, along he leads her.
Relating pleasant stories for to bind her
And all to make her unto him prove kinder.
And so in Love at last they live together
With pleasant days enjoying one another.
Tune of Lavender green, etc.
With Allowance,

To. L'Estrange.





LAvenders green, Diddle, diddle
Lavenders blue
You must love me diddle diddle,
cause I love you,
I heard one say diddle diddle
since I came hither,
That you and I diddle diddle
must lie together.
My hosttess maid diddle diddle
her name was Nell,
She was a lass diddle diddle
that I loved well,
But if she dye diddle diddle
by some mishap,
Then she shall lie diddle diddle
under the Tap.




That she may drink Diddle, diddle,
when she is a dry.
Because she loved Diddle, diddle
my Dog and I,
Coll up your Maids Diddle diddle
set them to work,
Some to make Hay, Diddle diddle
some to the Rock.
Some to make Hay, Diddle diddle,
some to the Corn
Whilst you and I Diddle, didle,
keep the bed warm,
Let the birds sing Diddle, diddle
and the Lambs play.
We shall be safe Diddle, diddle
out of harms way.
James at the George, Diddle, diddle
Sue at the Swan,
He loves his maid Diddle diddle,
she loves her man,
But if they chance Diddle, diddle
for to be found,
Catch them in the Corn Diddle diddle
put them in the pound.
I heard a bird Diddle, diddle
sing in my Ear,
Maids will be scarce Diddle, diddle,
the next New year,
For young men are Diddle, diddle
so wanton grown
That they never mind Diddle, diddle
which is their own.
Down in a Vale Diddle, diddle
where flowerrs do grow
And the birds sing Diddlle, diddle
all on a row.
A brisk young man Diddle, diddle
met with a Maid,
And laid her down, Diddle diddle
under the shade.
Where they did play Diddle, diddle
and Kiss and Court,
Like Lambs in May Diddle diddle
making fine sport.
There lives a Lass Diddle, diddle
over the Green,
She sells good Ale Diddle, diddle
think what I mean.
Often have I been Diddle, diddle
with her in the dark
And yet I nere Diddle diddle
shot at the mark.
But now my Dear Diddle, diddle
have at thy bumm
For I do swear Diddle, diddle
now I am come.
I will be kind Diddle diddle
until I dye,
Then prithee love Diddle diddle
my Dog and I.
For thee and I Diddle diddle
now are all one,
And we will lie Diddle diddle
no more alone.
