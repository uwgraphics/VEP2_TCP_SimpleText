The wandering Virgin: Or, The Coy Lass well Fitted.
Virgins whose coyness and disdain does prove
The fatal ruin of cemented Love,
Learn, and beware, lest you like me cry out
I Will find my Love, or search the world about
To the Tune of, Cloris awake, or the loving Chambermaid.




YOu Virgins so pretty
hear what I relate,
My case you may pity,
take heed of my fate:
How I was forsaken
you will hear it throughout,
But I Will travel the world over
to find my Love out.
Since I was the cause
that he first did disdain,
My overmuch coyness
both make him refrain:
But now I must blush
that it so comes about,
I would give all the world
I could find my Lov^ out.
Then straight my green gown
into breeches i will make,
And my long yellow Locks
much shorter i will take:
I Will wander, i will Wander,
I Will wander about,
And i will search all the world
for to find my Love out.
I Will get me a switch
and a sword by my side,
A Horse B^^^^ and Spurs,
and i will get up and ride:
I Will wander, i will wander,
i will wander about,
I Will search all the world
for to find my Love out.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.


My Love was a seemly
and proper young youth,
Though he did dissemble
I took all for truth,
So crafty in courtship
I never did doubt
But i would give all the world
I could search my Love out.
His forehead was smooth
and his locks they were curld
And him I adored above
all in the world:
His tongue went so smoothly
in Courtship profound
That I must have my Love
though I search the world round.
His Musical voice
it did make me admire
His courtship and carriage
did set me on fire:
I loved him so dearly
which makes me cry out
I^l find him, or wander
the world all about.
What fancy has took him
I much do admire
That he should reject the Love
he did require:
And since he is gone
I will wander about
And i will search all the world
but i will find my Love out.
My breath it grows short
and my face pale and wan
Which makes me admire
the power of the man:
My heart it does tremble,
which makes me to doubt
I shall want of my wits
if I find him not out.
Since Love I adore thee,
why should thou disdain
The suit of thy Lover,
that is subject to pain?
Be Kinder unto me,
and ease all my doubt,
For I Will search all the World,
but I Will find my Love out.
I Will travel the Deserts,
where fancy me leads,
Through Groves, Fields, and Forests
through Fountains, and Medes,
To find out my Dearest
i will gallop about,
And l'le range the wide world,
for to find my Love out.
I Will search over England,
to see if 't contain;
If not, i will turn Sailor,
and search on the Main,
The Ocean, so boundless,
i will travel about,
I Will range the wide world,
but i will find my Love out.
My Maidenhead-Iewell
it still is my own;
But if he had asked me,
be sure it had gone:
Then Maids have a care;
lest like me you cry out,
I Will find him, or wander
the world all about.
