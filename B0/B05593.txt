PROCLAMATION, Discharging Trade and Commerce with the City of London, and
other Places of the Kingdom of England, suspected of the Plague.
At Edinburgh, the twenty one of December, one thousand six hundred sixty five.
THe Lords of His Majesty's Privy Council, taking to their serious
consideration, that albeit by the infinite mercy of GOD, this Kingdom has been
hitherto preserved from the plague of Pestilence, which has long continued at
London, and broken out in many other Towns and Places of the Kingdom of
England; Yet the danger and fear of infection is as great as it has been
heretofore, by the resore of many People and Merchants to the City of London,
and other Places suspected, for beginning Commerce and Trade, and adventuring
to bring into this Kingdom all Commodities as formerly, albeit the Plague is
not yet altogether ceased, and that all Goods and Merchandise to be imported
from thence, may be yet justly suspected: And that Merchants and other
Traffickers may conceive, that the Act and Proclamation of the twelfth of July
last, whereby all Trade and Commerce betwixt this Kingdom and the City of
London, and other suspected Places, was discharged till the first of November
last, is now no more in force after the elapsing of the said first of November;
albeit by the said former Act and Proclamation, the said restraint and
prohibition is not only laid on till the said first of November, but ay and
while it should be expressly taken off by another Act and Proclamation.
Therefore, that none pretend ignorance, they of new ratify and approve the
foresaid Act, in the whole Heads and Clauses thereof, and ordains all parties
concerned to give full and exact obedience thereto, and declares the same to
stand and be of full force, until the first day of March next to come, in the
year of GOD, one thousand six hundred and sixty six, and longer, ay and while
the same be discharged: With certification, if any person whatsomever shall
contraveen the same, they shall be liable to the whole pains and penalties
therein contained, to be inflicted without mercy. And ordains these presents to
be printed, and published by Macers or Messengers at Arms, at the Mercat Cross
of Edinburgh, Peer and Shore of Lies, Mercat-crosses of Dunce and Jedburgh,
and other places needful, that none pretend ignorance.
