AS I sat at my Spinning-Wheel,
a bonny Lad there passed by,
I keen'd him round, and I liked him weel
geud Faith he had a bonny Eye:
My Heart new panting, 'gan to teel,
But still I turned my Spinning-Wheel
Most gracefully he did appear,
As he my presence did draw near,
And round about my slender Waste,
He clasped his Arms and me embraced:
To kiss my hand he down did kneel,
As I sat at my Spinning-Wheel.
gentleman lady

My Milk-white Hand he did extol,
And praised my Fingers long and small,
And said, there was no Lady fair,
That ever could with me compare:
Those pleasing words my Heart did feel,
But still I turned my Spinning-wheel.
Although I seemingly did chide,
Yet he would never be denied,
But did declare his love the more,
Until my Heart was wounded fore;
That I my love could scarce conceal,
But yet I turned my Spinning-wheel.
As for my Yarn, my Rock, and Reel,
And after that my Spinning-Wheel,
He bid me leave them all with speed,
And gang with him to yonder is Mead:
My panting Heart strange flames did feel,
Yet still I turned my Spinning-wheel.
He stopped and gazed and blithly said,
Now speed thee weel my bonny Maid,
But if thou'st to the Hay-Cock go,
I Will learn thee better Work I trow;
Geud Faith I liked him passing weel,
But still I turned my Spinning-wheel.
He lowly veiled his Bonnet ost,
And sweetly Kissed my Lips so soft,
Yet still between each honey Kiss,
He urged me gang to farther bliss;
'Till I resistless fire did feel,
Then let alone my Spinning-wheel.
Among the pleasant Cocks of Hay,
Then with my bonny Lad I lay,
What Damsel ever could deny,
A Youth with such a Charming Eye?
The pleasure I cannot reveal,
It far surpast the Spinning wheel.
