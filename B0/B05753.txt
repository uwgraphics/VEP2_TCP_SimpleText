THE Scottish Contract OR, A Marriage agreement betwixt wanton Willy and
mincing Meggy. All pleasant bumours this will fit, For a merrier song was never
mrit.
To a delightful Scoth Tune, or I am a silly old man.


Now welcome Meggy, my dear,
The beauty my senses Charm;
Come sit down bonnily here,
For Willy means thee no harm:
And freely before we part
A happy conclusion make,
That Willy's poor tender heart
No longer for Meggy do ache,
Then let us provide for bedding
And all that is bonny and gay,
For we will have a joviall Wedding
The Piper shall sweetly play.
O wanton Willy it is long
Since I lay in thy Arms,
Thou do thy Meggy wrong
To say that her beauty charms,
But if it be thy desire
And honestly thou art bent,
What ever thou shall require,
Poor Meggy will give content,
Then let us provide for bedding, etc.
Now Meggy our hearts are knit,
And Summer is in the prime:
My dear lets dally a bit
A little before the time:
O Willy we never were wedded
Before either Priest or Clark,
To part with my Maiden head,
I will not for twenty mark:
Then let, etc.
My honey thou needs not fear,
So faithful I will remain,
Then do not refuse my dear
A little to ease my pain:
O Willy until we are wed,
I never will yield that is and ^^at,
I rather will lose my head,
Then tell me no more of that.
But let us provide for bedding, etc.
Dear Meggy my fault forgive,
To try thee was my intent,
What needs thou at all to grieve,
My folly I do repent;
O Willy my only dear,
Had you such a mind to trap,
Thy Meggy which is so clear,
As baby that sucks the Pap.
Then let us provide, etc.
Now Meggy we are together,
I think it not labor waste,
If we do in time consider
Our business how to cast:
Dear Willy thou speak right,
And since we are both agreed,
Our friends we must all invite,
The better that we may speed.
Then let us provide for bedding,
And all that is bonny and gay,
For we will have a joviall wedding,
The piper shall merrily play.




Then Meggy I hold it fit,
The Vicar be our chief guest,
That he with his learned wit,
The better may grace our Feast:
Faith Willy thou art no liar,
A Dinner it is his due,
And Saxteen pence his hyre
For wedding both me and you.
Then let us provide for bedding,
And all that is bonny and gay,
For weel have a jovial wedding
The Piper aloud shall play.
We Will not spare for bidding
Although we be something poor
We Will keep such a wedding
As never was kept before:
We Will have Joccy my Cozen
And Jenny his lass with him,
And Lasses that are so trim.
Then let us provide, etc.
Now Meggy I think it best
The Piper be prepared,
For he must be our guest,
Or else our mirth is marred;
O honey what ere do chance
We Will have that Lad so brisk,
Then Willy shall see me dance,
With many a wanton frisk,
Then let us provide for bedding, etc.
Then since we are gone so far,
That Meggy must be my Bride,
I think we had best take care
What Uictuals we shall provide;
Faith Willy my Lad so free,
Thy Meggy can please her guess,
And thou shall plainly see,
How I my dinner will dress.
Then let us provide, etc.
First, we will have lang-cale Pottage,
And Puddings of Barley Meal,
Salt-Beef and Cabbadge
To relist a Coage of Ale;
Date Cakes steep't for Brewis,
And Bannacks that are so brwn;
Curds and Whay and Sowwings,
And liquor the best in Town.
Then let us provide, etc.
Troth Meggy it were but fit,
That we had a shank of Roast,
My Willy we want a Suit,
And we will we may spare the cost:
But if thy money recruit
Against our Wedding day,
Go buy a good frieze suit
Home spun of Country gray.
Then let us provide for bedding, etc.
My bonny thou will be glad
To see thy Willy so brave,
But wehn I am neatly clad,
What shall my bonny less have,
Faith Willy I Will buy two Coats
That shall be spanking new,
For Sax and twenty Groats,
We Will blended boath with Blew.
Then let us provide, etc.
A Bridegroom ^^alk to bring,
My honey do not forget,
And i will provide a Ring
For Meggy to wear of Ieat:
And now adieu to my dear,
Next Holiday weeele be Wed,
My Willy thou needs not fear,
Thou shall have a Maidenhead.
Then let us provide for bedding
And all that is bonny and gay,
For we will have a joviall Wedding
The Piper shall sweetly play.
