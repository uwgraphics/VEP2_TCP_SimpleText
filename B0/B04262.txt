Loyalty unfeigned, Or, The true Protestants Admonition. Being a Pleasant News
SONG.
Two dangerous Rocks on either hand appear,
We now 'twixt Scilla and Caribdis steer,
Our Pilot's Care (you will say) had need be great
It had so, for on each hand stands a Fate.
On either hand to Sail we suffer wrack,
Either to Starboard or the ^arboard Tack,
Therefore in Wisdom he has thought it best
To Sail foretight, for there the danger's least.
To the Tune of, Busy Fame, Young Pheon, or, The Fathers Exhortation.




HOld fast thy Sword and Scepter Charles
sad Times may else come on
The murmurs that do daily rise
smell Rank of Forty One.
When Subjects g^ve their Kings advice
what their Errence should be
(...) But mark the Papists wills a while
and you will find them great
How willing they are to a^^ a new,
from forty one to eight;
The world against them does complain,
their cruelties abhor
(...)





They Plotted our late troubles here,
though others pushed them on,
Fanatics they were in the Keer,
but Papists in the Van:
Whilst those who first embroiled the Stats
did laugh at our sad woes,
When they beheld our strong debate
turned to unfriendly blows.
Till three great Nations sweat in blood,
and many thousands slain,
The bosom of the Earth bestrew'd,
like dewey drops of Rain;
Then was the time that Rome laughed loud,
stand sported with our rage,
Till thrusting in amongst the Crowd,
that did fierce Battle wage.
Against the Lords anointed King,
persuading 'twas the way
The Royal Power to naught to bring,
by killing him bore sway,
This Iesuitick Doctrine soon,
(Oh fatal for to tell)
Trampled upon the sacred Crown,
by it the Mitre fell.
Thus Church and State bled whilst Rom's whore
the Scarlet Beast did ride,
The many headed factions bore
her in her greatest Pride;
And patiently sustained the Yoke
from which they deem d them free,
For then Religion was a Cloak
(...) Nor can it be more grievous sure
then when the proud Command
Of Usurpation we endure,
curbed by our Equals hands:
Princes are noble, and what they
impose we can disgust,
In their commands we God obey,
for they dispense Heavens trust.
Then let us all beware in time,
that Rome don't us deceive,
And evermore abhor the crime
of such as seek Geneve:
Let the blood-thirsty Papists all,
and slaughter seeking Crew,
Of Scismaticks before the fall,
great Monarch just and true.
Then will the Nation rest in peace,
both Church and State will be
Founded on perfect happiness
Great Charles's Monarchy
Will then its former Lusire gain,
France then will stand in awe,
Who now does triumph over the slain,
and gives the Nations Law.
Remember Kings are gods on Earth,
for Heaven it is they bear sway,
And are most sacred from their Birth,
which binds us to obey:
Then let such perish who deny
obedience to the Laws,
That do repine at Majesty,
(...)
