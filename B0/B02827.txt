Pretty KATE of Edenborough: BEING A New Scotch Song, Sung to the King at
WINDSOR.




^Just when the young and blooming Spring had melted down the winter Snow,
^And in the Grove the Birds did sing their charming Notes on every Bough:
^Poor Willy sat bemoaning his fate, and woeful state, for loving, loving,
loving,
^and despairing too, alas! he would cry, that I must dye, for pretty Kate of
Edenbrough.




WIlly was late at a Wedding-house,
where Lords and Ladies danced all arow,
But Willy none so pretty a Lass,
as bonny Kate of Edenborough;
Her bright eyes, with smiling joys,
did so surprise,
And something, something, something,
else that shot him through:
Thus Willy lies entranced in joys,
with pretty Kate of Edenborough.
The God of Love was Willy's Friend
and cast an eye of pity down,
And straight a fatal Dart did send
the cruel Virgins heart to wound:
Now every Dream is all of him,
who still does seem
More lovely, lovely, lovely,
since the Marriage Vow:
Thus Willy lies entranced in joys,
with pretty Kate of Edenbrough.
Now Willy thinks his happiness,
all other Creatures do exceed,
His tongue cannot his joys express,
since Kate and he are well agreed:
Both day and night her beauty bright,
is his delight,
And nothing, nothing, nothing,
else can Willy do,
But sound her Fame, and praise the Name
of pretty Kate of Edenbrough.
Cupid with his love does bless,
granting him his hearts desire,
He does continually express,
how that his heart is all on fire;
He feels no pains, amidst his Chains,
but still remains
A wounded, wounded, wounded
lover, firm and true;
And all his prate is now of late,
of pretty Kate of Ededbrough.
He swears her eyes are full of charms,
enough to conquer all the World,
Her Smiles secure him from all harms,
her Locks they are so nearly curled;
That in his mind he never shall find,
since she proves kind,
A Lover, Lover, Lover.
like his Katy true;
And does express his happiness,
in pretty Kate of Edenbrough,
FINIS.
