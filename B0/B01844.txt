Leader-haughs and Yarow.
To its own proper Tune.
WHen Phoebus bright the Azure Skies
with golden rays enlightneth,
These things sublunar he espics,
herbs, trees, and plants he quick'neth:
Among all those he makes his choice,
and gladly goes he through,
With radiant beams, and silver streams,
through Leader-Haughs and Yarow.
When Aries the day and night
in equal length divides,
Old frosty Saturn takes the flight
no longer he abides:
Then Flora Queen, with Mantle green,
casts off her deadly sorrow,
And vows to dwell with Ceres sell
in Leader-Haughs and Yarrow.
Pan playing with his Oaten ^eed,
with shepherds him attending,
Does here resort their flocks to feed,
the hills and haughs commending;
With bottle, bag, and staff with knag,
and all singing good morrow;
They swear no fields more pleasure yields
than Leader-haughs and Yarrow.
One house there stands on Leader side,
surmounting my descryving,
With ease-rooms rare, and windows fair,
like Daedalus contriving:
Men passing by, do often say,
in south it has no marrow;
It stands as fair on Leader side,
as New-wark does on Yarrow.
A mile below, who list to ride,
they will hear the Mavis singing;
Into St. Leonards Bank she will bide,
sweet Birks her head o're-hinging:
The Linewhite loud, and Progue proud,
with tender throats and narrow,
Into St. Leonards Banks do sing
as sweet^e as in Yarrow.
The Lapwing lilteth over the Lee,
with ^imble wings she sporteth;
But vows she will not come near the tree
where Philomel resorteth:
By break of day the Lark can say,
she bid you all good morrow;
I'l^ you^ and yell for^ may dwell
(...) ^eader-haughs and Yarow.
Park Wanton-walls, and Wooden-Cleugh,
the East and Wester Mainses,
The Forest of Lawder's fair enough,
the Corns are good in Blainslies;
Where Oats are fine, and sold by kind,
that if we search all through
Men's, Bnchan. Mar, none better are,
than Leader-^aughs and Yarow.
In Burn-Miln Boge, and White-slede shaws,
(...) fearful Hare she haunteth;
Bridge-haugh and Broad-wood sheil she knaws
to the Chapel-wood frequenteth:
Yet when she irks, to Kaiaslie Birks
she runs and sighs for sorrow,
That she should leave sweet Leader haughs
and cannot win to Yarow.
What sweetet music would you hear,
than Hounds and Beigles crying?
The Hare waits not, but flees for fear,
their hard pursuits defying.
But yet her strength it fails at length,
no beilding can she borrow
At Haggs, Cleckmae, nor Sorlesfield,
but longs to be at Yarow.
For Rock-wood, Rink-wood, Rival, Almer,
still thinking for to view her.
But O to fail her strength begins,
no cunning can rescue her:
Over dubb and dyke, over seugh and syke,
she I run the fields all through;
Yet ends her days in ^eader-haughs,
and bids farewell to Yarow.
Thou Erslingtouu and Colding-knowes,
where Humes had once commanding
And Dry Grange with thy milk white Ews
'twixt Tweed and Leader standings
The birds that flees through Red-path trees
and Gledswood Bank all through,
May chant and ^ng, sweet Leader-haughs,
and the bonny Banks of Yarrow.
But Burn cannot his grief assuage,
while as his days endures,
To see the changes of his age,
which day and time procures.
For many a place stands in hard case,
where Burns was blyth beforrow,
With Humes that dwelt on Leader side,
and Scots that dwelt in Yarow.
The words of Burn the Violer.
WHat? shall my Viol silent be,
or leave her wonted scriding?
But choice some sadder Elegy,
no sports and mirds deriding:
It must be fain with lower strain,
than it was wont beforrow,
To sound the praise of Leader-haughs,
and the bonny Banks of Yarrow.
But Floods have overflown the Banks,
the greenish Haughs disgracing,
And Trees in Woods grows thin in ranks
about the fields defacing.
For Waters waxes, Woods does waind,
more, if could for sorrow,
In rural Verse, I could rehearse,
of Leader-haughs and Yarow.
But sighs and sobs o'rsets my breath,
sore saltish tears forth sending.
All things Sublu^ar here on earth
are subject to an ending;
So must my Song, though somewhat long,
yet late at even and morrow,
I Will sigh and sing, sweet Leader-haughs,
and the bo^y Banks of Yarow.
Hic terminus haeres.
FINIS.
