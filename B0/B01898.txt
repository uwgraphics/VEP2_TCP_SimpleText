The CASE of the Company of DISTILLERS of London, in reference to a Bill,
Entitled, A Bill for encouraging the Distilling of Brandy from Corn, and for
laying several Duties upon Low Wines.
Which Bill will in Reality prevent the Distilling of Brandy from Corn,
Diminish the Kings Revenue, and Ruin the Trade of Distilling in England, and
set up the same in Foreign Parts.
THIS Bill seems to be designed for the Consumption of Corn, and by the Title
it is intimated, as if it were intended for increasing Their Majesty's Revenue,
whereas in Truth it will hinder the Consumption of Corn, as well as lessen the
Revenue, and will be of advantage to no Person in England, save such as are
Importers of French Brandy, of which Brandy there is now in London about 4000
Pieces; and if a great Duty be laid on the Materials which the Distillers use
for making English Brandy, they will in effect be prohibited the use of such
Materials, And the price of Brandy which is already advanced from 30 l. to 60
l. a Tun will rise much higher.

Note, That French Brandy is now but 8 l. a Ton in France, and if the
Imposition by this Bill designed, be laid on the Materials now used in England,
'twill make ^he French Traders run all manner of Hazards to bring in French
Brandy for so v^s^ a Profit, and no Industry or Integrity of the Officers will
be able to keep it out.

Spirits or Brandy made from Corn is not so palateable or grateful to the
Stomach as Brandy made from Molosses or Sugar, whereas Brandy made from
Molasses or Sugar almost equals Foreign Brandy, and consequently brings down
the Price of it; and by the Distillers Skill in mingling Brandy made from
Molosses with Spirits made from Corn, they have occasioned the sale and
consumption in Kind of several thousand Ton of Brandy made from Corn which
otherwise could not have been consumed in kind, and therefore the Importers of
Foreign Brandy have used all Industry to prohibit the Distillers the use of
Molosses, and if this Bill pass 8 d. a Gallon is thereby intended to be laid on
Low Wines extracted from Molosses, which with the Duty already thereon will
amount to 23 l. a Ton upon the Spirit, which is so great a Duty that the
Distillers cannot use it, and then the Importers of Foreign Brandy have their
Ends, but Their Majesty's and the Nation will be injured for that the Revenue
and the consumption of Malted Corn will thereby be lessened.

The Distillers do now use many Thousand Quarters of Corn in a Year, and do
make as good Brandy from Corn as can be made by any Person whatsoever, and if
they had encouragement could make much greater quantities than can be consumed
here and in Foreign Parts, yet this Bill lays open the Trade to every
unskilful pretender; which will put Their Majesty's to much greater Expense in
Collecting the Duty and encourage the making a bad Commodity for the makers
profit, who are under no regulation or punishment if they so do. The
Consequence whereof will be the preventing the consumption of Corn, and ruin
the Distillers, whose Company first invented the making of Spirits from Corn,
and who for these many years past have born a proportionable part of the
Expense necessary for the support of the Honor and Government of the City, and
are now increased with their Apprentices and Servants to be very numerous.

The Duty laid on Spirits made from Mollosses by this Bill is so great that it
cannot be used here, therefore the Merchants will be forced to send their
Mollosses to Holland, where it is made partly into Sugar by Refiners and
Sugar-Bakers, and partly Distilled; and both those Trades were till lately
either not known, or rarely practiced there, but are since grown considerable;
and if this Bill passes, will both be much advanced, and the Dutch will not
only in Foreign parts under-sell us, but by Vessels laid near our Harbors for
that purpose, supply all our Outwardbound Ships with the Spirits made of
Mollosses as cheap or cheaper than we can with Spirits made of Corn, though that
be much worse than what is made of Molasses, because we pay a great Duty and
they none.

There are several other parts of this Bill which tend not only to the
Destruction of the Distillers Trade, but of Their Majesty's Plantations, and
the lessening Their Majesty's Revenue, and will promote the Interest of
Foreigners, and other Mischiefs which the Distillers are ready to make appear
if they may be permitted to be heard thereunto.
