A most Notaple Example of an ungracious Son, who in the pride of his heart
denied his own Father, and how God for his offense turned his meat into
loathsome Toads.
To the tune of, Lord Darby.


In searching famous Chronicles,
it was my chance to read
A worthy story strange and true,
whereto I took god heed,
Betwixt a Father and a Son
this rare example stands,
which well may move ye hardest hearts
to weep and wring their hands.
This Farmer in the Country lived,
whose substance did excel
He sent therefore his eldest Son
in Paris for to dwell,
Where he became a Merchant man,
and traffic great he used,
So that he was exceeding rich
till he himself abused.
For having now the world at will
his mind was wholly bent,
To Gaming wine and wantonness,
till all his goods was spent,
Yea such evecssive Ryotousnesse,
by him was showed forth,
That he was three times more in debt
then all his health was worth.
At length his credit clean was crakt
and be in prison cast,
And every man against him then,
did set his act on fast,
There be lay locked in Irons strong,
for ever and for aye,
Unable while his life did last,
his grievous debt to pay.
And living in this woeful case,
his Eyes with tears he spent;
The lewdness of his former life
too late he did repent,
And being hold of all relief,
of help and comfort quite,
Unto his Father at the last
he thus began to write.
Bow down a while your boedful ears
my loving Father dear,
And grant I pray in gracious sort
my pittious plaint to hear,
Forgive the foul offenses all,
of your unworthy son,
Which through the lewdness of his life
has now himself undone.
O my good Father take remorse
on this my extreme need,
And succor his disteessed state
whose heart for woe does bleed,
In direful Dungeon here I lie
my feet in setters fast.
Whom my most cruel creditors
in Prison have me cast.
Let pity therefore pierce your breast,
and mercy move your mind
And to release my mesery.
some shift dear Father find,
My chiefest Cheer is bread full brown
^ the boards my fastest bed
And flin^ly stones my pillows serve,
to rest my troubled head.


My garments all are worn to rags
my body star^es with cold.
And crawling Vermin eat my flesh
must grievous to behold,
Dear Father come therefore with speed
and ^id me out of thrall.
And let me not in prison dye,
since by your help I call.
The good did man no sooner had
parus'd this written Scrowl,
But trickling tears along his cheeks,
most plenteously did roll,
Alas my son, my son quoth he,
in whom I joyed most,
Thou shall not long in prison be
what ever it me cost.
Two hundred heads of well fed beasts
he changed into gold,
Four hundred quarters of good corn,
for silver eke he sold,
But all the same could not suffice
this heinous fa^t to pay,
Till at the last constrained was
to sell his land away.
Then was his son released quite
his debts discharged clean,
And he like as well to live,
as he before had been.
Then went his loving Father home
who for to help his son,
had sold his living quite away
and eke himself undone.
So that he lived poor and bare
and in such extreme need,
That many times he wanted food
his hungry corpse to feed,
His son mean time in wealth did swim
whose substance now was such
That sure within the City then
few were founded so rich.
But as his goods did still increase
and riches in did slide
So more and more his hardened heart
did swell in hateful pride,
But it fell out upon a time
when ten years woe was past,
Unto his son he did repair,
for some releif at last
And being come unto his house
in very poor array,
It chanced so that with his son
great state should dine that day
The poor old man with hat in hand,
did then the Porter pray,
To show his son that at the gate
his Father there did stay.
Where at this proud disdainful wretch
with taunting speeches said,
That long ago his Fathers bones
within the grave was laid,
What Rascal then is that quoth he,
that staineth so my state?
I charge the Porter presently,
to drive him from my gate,
Which answer when the old man heard
he was in mind dismayed,
He wept he waild he wrong his hand,
and thus at length he said,
O cursed wretch, and most unkind,
and worker of my woe
Thou monster of humanity,
and eke thy fathers Fo.
Have I been careful of thy case,
maintaining still thy state,
And do thou now most dogged
enforce me from thy gate.
And have I wronged thy brethren
from shrall to set thee free,
And brought my self to beggars sta(...)
and all to succor thee,
Woe worth the time when first of al(...)
thy body I esp^'d:
Which has in hardness of thy he(...)
thy fathers face denied,
But now behold bow God that ti(...)
did show a wonder great,
Even when his son and all his fri(...)
were settled down to meat.
For when the fairest pie was cut
a strange and dreadful case,
Most ugly Toads came crawling (...)
and leaped in his face,
Then did this wretch his fault con(...)
and for his Father sent.
And for his great ingratitude
full fore be did repent.
All virtuous children learn by this
obedient hearts to show,
And honor still your Parents dea(...)
for God commanded so
And think how he did turn his mea(...)
to poisonous Loads indeed,
Which did his Fathers face deny
because he stood in need.
