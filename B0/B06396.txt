THE Ungrateful Rebel; OR, Gracious Clemency Rewarded with Villainy.
Tune of, The Turn-Coat of the Times.


HEre is a disloyal Tutch,
Now newly come from the Dutch,
Of one that has acted much;
And of the Factious breed,
He was in the West indeed,
Now b^tter to Hang than feed;
His Pardon he did obtain,
And now he is gone again,
To join with the Dutch;
And have the other tutch,
Is this not a Rogue in grain?
He did a Letter send,
Unto an old Factious Friend,
And these was the Lines he penned
Allegiance now give over,
And come to the West once more,
Here Is Silver and Gold Gillore,
Never stand in the least to pause,
Or startle at breach of Laws,
But venture your Neck,
It is but a check,
Stand up for the good old Cause.
To my Credit be it spoke,
I kept a Shop, but I broke,
And vanished away in smoke;
My Creditors great and small,
In Faith I have paid them all,
But gave them no Coin at all,
And now I am gone to fight,
And whether't be wrong or right,
I cried down the Pope,
But it is with that hope,
To get a good Booty by it.
Though we a Rebellion make,
And Heavenly Laws do break,
It is for Religions sake;
And therefore we proceed,
To make the whole Nation bleed,
And count it a righteous deed:
When ever I do draw nigh,
Great Persons of Loyalty,
Is I am a Knave,
Their Treasure I crave;
For Riffling who but I.
We rally and march about,
To find the Rich Romans out,
Then put them all to the rout,
Nay, any Protestant Lord,
If with us he will not accord,
We'll presently fall aboard;
For being both stout and strong,
We will not stand parling long:
If Loyal he be,
It Is all one to we,
We'll Plunder him right or wrong.
To take off the Nations Yoke,
Religion is made a Cloak,
To cover the fatal stroke,
But for my part alone,
Religion I never had none,
Except to disturb the Throne:
With Orange now brisk and trim
I venture both Life and Limb,
And if the great Turk,
Would set me at work,
I would do as much for him.
