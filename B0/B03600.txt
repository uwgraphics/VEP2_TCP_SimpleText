God Speed the Plow,
And Bless the Corn-Mow.

A Dialogue between The Husbandman and Serving-man.
The Serving-man, the Plow man would invite
To leave his Calling, and to take Delight;
But to that, by no means will agree,
Lest he thereby should come to Beggary.
He makes it plain appear, a Country Life
Does far excel; and so they end the Strife.
The Tune is, I am the Duke of Norfolk.
Servingman

Husbandman



My Noble friends Give Ear,
If Mirth you love to hear,
I'e tell you as fast as I can,
A story very True,
Then mark what does ensue,
concerning of a Husbandman.
Serving-Man. A Serving-man did meet
A Husbandman in the street,
and thus unto him he began;
I pray you tell to me
Of what Calling you be;
or if you be a Serving-man.

Husbandman. Quoth he, my brother dear,
The Coast I mean to Clear,
and the truth you shall Understand.
I do no one disdain;
But this I tell you Plain,
I am an honest Husbandman.

Serving-man. If a Husbandman you be,
Then Come along with me;
i will help you as soon as I can;
Unto a gallant place,
Where in a little space,
you shall be a Serving-man.

Husbandman. Sir, for your diligence,
I Give you many thanks:
then answered the Plowman again,
I pray you to me show
Whereby that I might know,
what Pleasures has a Serving-man.

Serving-man. A Serving-man has pleasure,
Which passes time and measure;
when the Hauk on his Fist does stand,
His hood and his verril's brave,
And other things we have,
which yields Joy to a Serving-man,

Husbandman. My pleasures more than that,
To see my Oxen fat,
and to prosper well under my hand
And therefore I do mean,
With my Horse and Team
to keep my self a husbandman.

Serving-man. O it is a Gallant thing,
In the prime time of the Spring,
to hear the hunts-men now and then
His Beaugle for to blow
And the hounds Run all a row;
this is pleasure for a serving-man:
To hear the Beagle Cry,
And to see the Faulcon fly,
and the hare trip over the plain,
And the Hunts-men and the hound,
Makes Hill and Dale rebound:
this is pleasure for a Serving-man.

Husbandman. It Is pleasure you know
To see the Corn to Grow;
and to grow so well on the Land,
The Plowing and the Sowing,
The Reaping and the Mowing
yields pleasure to the Husbandman.

Serving-man. At our Table you may Eat
All sorts of Dainty Meat;
Pig, Cony, Goose, Capon, and Swan;
And with Lords and Ladies fine,
You may drink bear, ale, and wine,
this is pleasure for a Serving-man.

Husband man. While you Eat Goose and Capon,
I Will feed on Beef and Bscon,
and piece of hard Cheese now and then;
We Pudding have, and Souse,
Always ready in the house;
which Contents the honest Husbandman

Serving-man. At the Court you may have,
Your Garments fine and brave,
and Cloak with Gold Lace laid upon,
A shirt as white as milk,
And wrought with finest silk,
that is pleasure for a serving-man.

Husbandman. Such proud and costly Gear,
Is not for us to wear,
amongst the briars and brambles many on
A Good strong russet Coat,
And at your need a groat,
will suffice the husbandman.
A Proverb hear I tell,
Which likes my humor well,
and remember it well I can,
If a Courtier be to bold,
He Will want when he is old,
then farewell the serving-man.

Serving-man. It needs must be Confessed,
That your Calling Is the best;
no longer discourse with you I can.
But henceforth I will pray,
By night and by day;
Heavens bless the honest husband man.

FISIN.
