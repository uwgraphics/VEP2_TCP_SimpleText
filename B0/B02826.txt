The Northern DITTY: OR, THE Scotch-man Outwitted by the Country Damsel.
To an excellent New Scotch Tune, of Cold and Raw the North did blow, etc.
A Song much in Request at Court.
This may be Printed, R. P.





COld and Raw the North did blow
bleak in the morning early;
All the Trees were hid with Snow,
covered with Winters yearly:
As I came riding over the Slough,
I met with a Farmers Daughter;
Rosy Cheeks, and bonny Brow,
g^^d Faith made my mouth to water.
Down I veiled my Bonnet low,
meaning to show my breeding,
She returned a grateful bow,
her Visage far exceeding;
I asked here where she went so soon,
and longed to begin a Parley;
She told me to the next Market Town,
a purpose to sell her Barley.




In this Purse, sweet Soul, said I,
twenty pound lies fairly,
Seek no farther one to buy,
for I'se take all thy Barley:
Twenty more shall purchase delight,
thy Person I love so dearly,
It thou will lig by me all night,
and gang home in the morning early.
If Forty pound would buy the Globe,
this thing I Would not do Sir,
Or were my Friends as poor as Job,
I Would never raise 'em so Sir:
For should you prove to night my Friend,
we'se get a young Kid together,
And you would be gone ever nine Months end,
and where shall I find the Father?
Pray what would my Parents say,
if I should be so silly,
To give my Maidenhead away,
and lose my true Love Billy?
Oh, this would bring me to Disgrace,
and therefore I say you nay, Sir;
And if that you would me Embrace,
first Marry, and then you may Sir.
I told her I had Wedded been,
fourteen years and longer,
Else I Would choose her for my Queen,
and tie the Knot yet stronger.
She bid me then no farther come,
but manage my Wedlock fairly,
And keep my Purse for poor Spouse at home,
for some other should have her Barley.
Then as swift as any Roe,
she rode away and left me;
After her I could not go,
of Joy she quite bereft me:
Thus I my self did disappoint,
for she did leave me fairly,
My words knocked all things out of joint,
I lost both the maid and barley.
