The Squire's Grief Crowned with Comfort: OR, Nectar preferred before Scornful
Cynthia,
To the Tune of Let the Soldiers rejoice.
Licensed according to Order





ARe the Fates so unkind,
As to keep me confined,
Debarred of all Free -- dom and Pleasure?
For the young Charming Saint,
Never regards my Complaint,
But deny's me, deny's me the Fountain of Pleasure.
I Am caught in the Snare,
Of a Beauty so fair,
Whom all the whole Worcester -- ld will admire;
At her Feet when I bow,
Not a Smile she will allow,.
But she leaves me, she leaves me, to burn with desire


When I tell her of Love
Thar I prize none above
Fair Cynthia my A -- morous Jewel;
She returns me her Frown,
Which does quite run me down;
Oh! was ever, was ever a Creature so cruel!
When her Eyes I beheld,
With Raptures I swelled
To gain her I u -- s'd my endeavor;
But yet all was in vain,
I might sigh and complain.
She denied me, denied me the Blessing for ever.
Being clearly denied,
I in sorrow replied,
Whom Beauty a -- lone has invited,
Is rejected at last,
This my Glory does blast,
Oh! was ever was, ever young Lover so slighted?
Thus with sorrow apprest,
And denied of all rest,
I started when e -- 'er I did slumber,
For my sorrows were more,
Then the sands on the shore,
For I tell you, I tell you, they were out of m^.
But at length I took Heart,
And defended the Dart,
And with a good I -- ace I can carry it.
And solemnly declare,
There Is no Cynthia so fair,
As a Bottle, a Bottle of delicate Clare^.
This my Ioys will restore,
I Will regard her no more,
Nor trouble my Nod -- dle about her,
For my Heart is at ease,
I can love when I please,
Therefore tell her, now till her I can love (...)
