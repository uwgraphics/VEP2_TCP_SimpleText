A mournful Epitaph upon the death of that reverend worthy Pastor Mr. JOHN
ROGERS, late preacher of Gods word at Dedham in Essex, who departed this life
the 18 of October in the year 1636.
1.
COme help us mourn good Shepherds all,
who love Christ's flock in deed
Help us to beg, plead, cry and call,
in this our time of need.
2.
Come weep and mourn both young and old,
your hearts to sorrow move
Both Sheep and Lambs all of his fould
show forth your dearest love.
3.
Our joy is gone, our souls delight,
our blessed son of thunder,
Our valiant champion in Gods sight,
to break sins boults in sunder.
4.
Our famous light which lately stood
on hill within our town:
Whose beams were spread so far abroad,
is now by death took down.
5.
Those lively crystal streams so pure,
with pastures fresh and green;
From us alas are locked full sure,
and can no more beseene.
6.
Oh mournful flock who art deprived
of such a faithful guide;
Whose drooping souls he has revived
full many a time and tide.
7.
Our faithful Moses now is gone,
which stood up in the breach;
To stay Gods wrath with many a groan,
his hands to heaven did stretch.
8.
His life Gods glory did advance,
his doctrine good and plain:
And by Gods holy ordinance,
he many a soul did gain.
9.
No pain nor labor he did spare,
the hungry souls to feed,
Dividing out each one his share,
according to their need.
10.
A person grave, a patron rare,
most humble, godly, wise,
Whose presence made the wicked fear,
when they beheld his eyes.
11.
His ears were open and attent,
to hear the poor man's cry:
And speedily his heart was bent,
to find a remedy.
12.
To rich and poor, to old and young,
most courteous mild and meek,
The mourning souls he brought along,
and comforted the weak.
13.
Much comfort here his soul possessed,
his life fame, and renown,
And now with Saints and Anglels blessed,
he wears a glorious crown.
14.
Where many a soul is gone before,
which he through Christ has gained,
His glory shines as Sun therefore,
and never shall be stained.
15.
You pastors all of Christ his fould,
of souls who have the charge,
See here a pattern to behold,
your duties to your charge.
16.
His faith, his love, his godly care,
his (...) sin to ^upp^^sse:
His pity ^howes to such as were,
in grief and heaviness.
17.
His humble heart did soon make peace,
by arbitration wife,
All jars and strifes he made to cease,
twixt neighbors that did rise.
18.
But now those joyful days are gone,
which made our hearts so glad,
And comfort brought to many one,
when sorrow made them sad.
19.
Our Zion temple songs do cease,
our burning shining light
Is gone to everlasting peace,
and bids us all good night.
20.
Our constant Lector twelve days fame,
and joy of Saints all round,
To which Gods armies flocking came,
to hear his doctrine sound,
21.
Gods holy Law and Gospel pure,
he preached with courage bold,
Whereby he many did allure,
and brought to Christ his fould.
22.
The poor and hungry souls always,
with good things he did fill,
The rich, nor any went away,
without Gods mind and will.
23.
Most faithfully he preached Gods will,
with wisdom from above,
And left for to direct us still,
his book of faith and love.
24.
Gods counsel and the narrow way,
he clearly did unfold.
Without excuse to leave all they.
that would not be controld.
25.
His proudest foes on overy side,
who sought his deprivation,
He still did overcome their pride,
by humble conversation,
26.
Against hels force and Satan's rage,
God kept him in his station,
And still preserved him in his old age,
in Dedhams congregation.
27.
From week to week, from day to day,
he cried in our ears:
And this he did without delay,
the space of thirty years.
28.
In zeal he was a flaming fire,
yet humble and discreet.
Which made his chiefest foes admire,
and swadged their malice great.
29.
They often sought for to prevail
to take away our joy,
To quench our light they did assail,
our glory to destroy.
30.
But God did guard his choice elect,
who worthy was through Christ.
From dangers all did him protect,
and took him home at last.
31.
The time of life that God him lent,
was threescore years and seven,
The greatest part of which he spent,
to bring souls unto heaven.
32.
Oh happy (...) and blessed gain,
good time (...) him to die,
^
^.
33.
Yet happy now likewise are they,
which are in state of grace,
And were so wise that in their days,
with God they made their peace.
34.
Now magnify the providence,
of Gods election strong,
That he such days by sure defense,
in mercy did prolong.
35.
And now hold fast with diligence,
the trueths which you have learned
And bring forth fruit with patience,
that grace may be discerned.
36.
Those graces learn to imitate,
in him which shines so bright,
So shall thou live in happy state,
and pleasing in Gods sight.
37.
A wife has lost a heavenly head,
children a father dear,
A loss to all on every side,
and to his flock most near,
38.
His house a blessed Bethel was,
as plainly did appear:
He lived to see his fruits in grace.
on all his children dear.
39.
But now alas what shall we do
Gods anger to revoke.
Our sinfulness have brought us to
this sad and heavy stroke.
40.
Our sleepy formal carelessness,
in hearing of Gods word:
Unfruitful barren heartedness,
though we with means were stored.
41.
All those that have worn out this light,
and yet remain all dark,
How shall it now their souls affright,
to wear this cursed mark.
42.
Now let us all repent and pray,
with zeal and fervency,
That of the Lord obtain we may,
some comfort and supply.
43.
Our King and Counsel Lord preserve,
and all of each degree,
That from his truth we may not swerve,
but therein live and die.
44.
That with him that is gone before,
a kingdom may obtain.
And then with Saints for evermore,
in glory may remain.
AN EPIGRAM.
I n morning wake with God, and beg his grace,
O ffend not his good spirit in any case,
H ang fast on Christ, cleave closse unto his word,
N o time forget to wear the christian sword,
R un cheerfully your general is before,
O ur blessed captain Christ has opened the door
G ot victory against sin, death, and hell,
E ternall life for are with him shall dwell,
R eturne my soul go fo^rth unto thy rest,
S trange joys are gone which cannot be expressed.
FINIS.
