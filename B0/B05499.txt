A PROCLAMATION, Anent Officers and Soldiers paying their Quarters.
JAMES, by the Grace of GOD, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith;
To (...) Macers of Our Privy Council, and Messengers at Arms, Our Sheriffs in
that part, conjunctly and severally, specially constitute, Greeting:
Whereas We are certainly informed, that Complaints have been made from several
parts of this Our ancient Kingdom, that some of Our Soldiers have been, and
still are deficient in paying their Quarters, and that there has been cause
given for the like applications from some other places, although such
complaints have not been made; Which Disorderly and unjust Practices cannot but
be very displeasing unto Us: Wherefore We have now thought fit, (for Redressing
such Disorders already committed, and preventing the like Abuses for the
future) With Advice of Our Privy Council, hereby strictly to Require all the
Officers of Our standing Forces of this Kingdom to take special care, that all
such Soldiers (now alive, and serving in the Army) as ow any Moneys for their
Provisions in any Quarters, forthwith to pay the same, and to use their outmost
Diligence and Care for the future, to see that the Soldiers under their
respective Commands, from time to time, pay what Money shall be due by them for
Provisions in their Quarters; and particularly, that before their removal from
any place, there be nothing left unpayed in, their respective Quarters, either
by Officers or Soldiers, except where they are so suddenly called that they
cannot stay to fit accounts; in which case the Commanding Officer is to leave
an Obligation for paying of what shall be justly owing, within the space of
twenty days thereafter, at furthest; With Certification to all such Officers
who shall be negligent or remiss in the Execution of this Our Royal Pleasure,
and especially in severely punishing all such Soldiers, under their Charge,
who are, or shall be guilty of such Disorderly Practices, that they shall not
only be Carshired, but also further punished according to their demerits: And
to the end it may be the better known, what Moneys are, or shall be owing by
the Soldiers for Provisions in any of their Quarters, We hereby ordain the
persons who have, or shall furnish the Provisions, To state an account thereof,
in the way and manner prescribed by the third Act of the last Parliament of Our
dearest Brother; and that Our standing Forces may be sufficiently furnished
with all necessary Provisions, and not unjustly imposed on for the future, nor
unreasonable Rates exacted of them by the Country, for such things as they
stand in need of, either in their Quarters, or on their March from place to
place; We with Advice foresaid, Require and Command the Sheriff Principal, and
his Deput, or Deputs, in the respective Shires of this Kingdom, with any two or
three of the Commissioners of Excise or Supply, forthwith, where rates are not
already appointed, and yearly thereafter, at their Michaelmas head Courts, to
set reasonable rates and prices upon Hay, Straw, and Oats, and for Grass,
betwixt and the first Thursday of May, that it may be known what is to be paid
for the same, and to report exact accounts of their Diligence, and of the said
rates, to the Clerks of Our Council, within fourteen days after appointing
thereof, at the Dyets respective above-written, with Certification to them, if
they failie herein, they shall be called and pursued before Our Council, and
punished as they find cause. And to the effect Our Pleasure in the Premises
may be known to all persons concerned; Our Will is, and We Charge you
strictly-and Command, that incontinent, these Our Letters seen, ye pass to the
Market Cross of Edinburgh, and remanent Market Crosses of the Head Burghs of
this Kingdom, and other places needful, and there, by open Proclamation, make
publication of Our Pleasure in the Premises, that all persons concerned may
have notice thereof, and give obedience thereto.
