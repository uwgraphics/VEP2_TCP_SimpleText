The Emblem of Our KING; And of the SCOTS and ENGLISH PARLIAMENTS: A POEM Dulce
et Decorum est pro Patria mori.
Horatius.

By a well Wisher to King, and Parliaments.

Regum timendorum in proprios greges
Reges in ipsos Imperium est Jovis.
Horatius. Ecce silet Maris unda, silent et flamina venti
Haud tamen intra nostra silent precordia curae.
Theocritus Honor fugacem perseq^^^^^ (...)
Fugit sequacem: si fugis occupat
Ut Umbra, venantesque ludit
Niliaca Crocodilus alga.
Hermanus Hugo. Vive, Vale, si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti: si non, his utere mecum.
Horatius EDINBURGH, Printed by John Reid 1700.

The PROEMIUM, OR INTRODUCTION.
(1)
IF King's by Birth and Right do not mantain
Their Crowns and Scepters, and by Love do Reign;
If David, Saul or Solomon did Sway
Their Scepters by their Subjects word obey,
And not by the Decree of GOD alone:
Let Angles Call Three Parliaments in One.
(2)
N Nothing is found in Scripture to Defend
Or yet a Shadow to this Them extend;
That Kings be Governed by a Parliament;
Except a Council given us be of Trent:
For Samuel surely by GOD's sure Decree
Anointed Saul a Monarch for to be
(3)
G Goodness alone of Love and Charity
And great Compassion moved the Trinity,
To come from their Abyss of Happiness,
And make the Fabric of this Universe;
Who could have lived perpetually in Bliss,
Without our Praises or a ficunt born Wish.
(4)
R Rich was this Love of GOD (the Blessed Three)
But our Redemption by Immanuel see;
The first (to wit Creation) was but Love,
The second only the Extent does prove:
A third then take with you, a Noah's Race,
How Providence Governs all here by Grace.
(5)
A At last shall I Commemorate Christ's Death
Who died upon a Cross for Mortal Breath;
Who took upon him our Mortality
And was an Emblem of Humility,
Who, (sin excepted) paralleled a Man
In likeness, yet in Graces bore the Van.
(6)
T This GOD has kept His Church from Peter's time
In Chains of Gold, most perfect, through the Rhene,
And France and Rome and Flanders, Germany
Do Harbor Papists to a vast degree:
Yet Scotland, England, Ireland do possess
St John's Religion free of Munick Mass.
(7)
I Ingratitude, by all Men hatted be;
To whom (next unto GOD) our Liberty
Does Scotland, England, and Old Ireland to
But unto Great King William humbly ow?
Let Thanks to GOD, and Honor to the King
Our Parliaments and our Assemblies Sing.
(8)
T Then let the King, his Majesty Condole
The loss of our Great Northern Artick Pole,
Our Caledonian and our Albion Fleet,
And come and view, how Scotland now does weep,
For Providence's Procedure against the Trade
Whose rising would have made thy Subjects glad.
(9)
U Unto Despair, Poor SCOTLAND faints now,
And longs to see thy MAJESTY to do
It Right, and Justice, in a Purer-Sense,
Than Faint-Addresses sent with Reverence.
Since no Petitions by Our COMPANY,
Could move the Angles, with SCOTS to agree.
(10)
D Danger and Loss, and Grief, and Fear prevail,
Of DARIEN TRADE, of Our St. Andrews Sail,
Of Edinburghs-Burning, and Kirk Registers,
Of Parliament's- Adjournments, are Our Cares;
Come, Noble Hero, most Illustrious KING,
Sail over the Main, and take a Turtles-Wing.
(11)
E Except thy yet more Pressing-hot Affairs,
Detain Thee not in Holland, Loo, thy Fears;
Come down to SCOTLAND, and be Crowned here
Let no Advice Suspend Thee, nor a Tear:
But come like Alexander, kind Serene,
Thy MAJESTY, and Court we'll Entertain.
SCOTLANDS first Address to the KING.
IF I had Clouds, and could the same Preserve,
Nothing from Fears should cause my Motion Swerve;
Grant me the Treasures of the Main to keep,
Rich Floods of Tears, will Testify, I Weep;
And shall my Grief, be Quarrellous or Mute,
To Pray to GOD, who sees me Destitute!
If little shows my Face, my Minds intent,
Then Smile when Grieved, when Pleased, I will Lament.
Unless my Groans, my Sighs, and Tears the KING,
Dispell, and Cause our Cities Bells to Ring,
Enter my Sorrows now and mount the Wing.
Scotland's, or Africa Companys second Address to the King.
IF it be Vain Our Losses to Deplore,
Now Tears are empty, let us Weep no more,
Go tell thy KING, thy Mind and thy Desire,
Reason the Matter, Charity 'll inspire,
A Generous Soul to listen, hear and say,
Thy Modest Suit, (ADDRESSES) well obey,
If it be Vain, thy other Pains to tell,
Till Thy Address, with Mounting Wings can Sail,
Under Thy Cover, Shelter thou thine Head
Deny to Speak, but look as Thou were Dead,
Except Thy Wounds a PARLIAMENT Remeid.
Scotland's, or African-Company's Third and last Address to His Majesty,
presented by the Lord Ross, and others.
IF all my Sufferings no Compassion move,
Nor yet persuade the Angles Us to Love;
Good GOD Protect us, KING and Parliament!
Recoile, O SCOTLAND, View thy Banishment:
Ah! if Our Sorrows had a Parallel,
Taught by Example, I should bear them well,
If my base Slavery is alone my Blame,
Then less to be Bewailed with Tears, than shame,
Under this Took by Magic, am I bound?
Do Sun, Moon, Stars, in Circle go the Round,
Except I Move and Act, I Will gain no Ground.
A DIALOGUE, Betwixt KING, House of PEERS, the PARLIAMFNT, and House of
COMMONS. called Burrows by the Author.
KInd Council, Peers, and Parliament. You see,
I Am Deafed with Sighs of Scotland's Misery;
Now solve me where to fix my Doubtful Love,
Grant me my Wish, or let my Pity Move.
PRince, King, Dread Sovereign, Monarch of our Lands,
And sole Protector of Our Hearts and Hands;
Reason, Religion, Faith, Love, Charity,
Ly hid to England, if it lose Piety:
If we can never Embrace Scots in our Arms
And never be darted by their Wounds and Charms;
Must generous England ever Soar above
Extremely silent and yet ardent Love?
No surely: let the King grant their Request,
That kind led Fires of Love within our Breast.
BEnign, Kind Monarch of our Lands and Hearts
Unto thy Goodness we ow Trade and Arts;
Religion, freedom from the Mass and Charm
Rising from four pound Proselyts to harm:
Oh! come and view our Citys; Crown thy self.
Why we be Loyal, though we have no Wealth.
Scotland's poor soil will not prejudge thy Health
The Authors Wish or Desiderium.
Desires are faint yet Languishing they be,
Even when possessed they cannot satisfy.
Sorrow and Fear torment the Soul by turns,
If both concur, behold the Fever burns.
Distance and Absence may retard our Love
Even present Joy our Constancy does prove.
Reason and Wit a kindly Sympathy
Indu'd with Love also with Charity,
Under my Cross or Comfort shall excel
More then they who like China proudly swell.
FINIS.
