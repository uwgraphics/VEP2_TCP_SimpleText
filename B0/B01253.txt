Orders appointed by His most Excellent Majesty, and signified by special
Letters from the Right Honorable the Lords of His most Honorable Privy
Counsel, which all persons within this County, of what degree or quality
soever, are straightly commanded to observe.
1. FOrasmuch as the Sergeants, who were sent by His Majesty into this County,
for the Exercising and Instructing of the trained Soldiers here, have done
much good, yet not so much as His Majesty may justly expect from so exact
Rules and Directions as were given; a great cause whereof has been, for that
as well diverse who stand charged with finding of Arms, have of late days
been negligent to send their Soldiers and Arms to the usual places of
Traynings; as also the Soldiers when they were there, have gone away as soon
as they were called, before they have been exercised, and have come thither
without Powder and Match; It is now therefore straightly required, That from
henceforwards, no man whatsoever, that finds either Horse or Foot, presume to
fail in sending such Horsemen, Powder, and Arms which he is charged to send
to the usual places of Musters, and that no Soldier presume to depart from
his Colors, until he shall be discharged by his Captain, And that no man
charged with either Horse or Foot, do presume to borrow either Horse or
Arms, but that he have the same always by him to be ready at an hours
warning, upon pain of severe punishment, if the same be discovered. 2.
Whereas His Majesty has a special care, that both Captains, Officers and
Soldiers, be not only able and sufficient men, but also well affected in
Religion, and has therefore given express Commandment, that as well the
Officers as Soldiers, be not only able and sufficient men, but also well
affected in Religion; to which purpose His Majesty has commanded, that as well
the Officers as Soldiers, take the Oathe of Allegiance; That they therefore
take notice hereof, and fail not to be present at the time of Traynings, when
they are to take the said Oath, lest a Certificate being made to the Lords of
the Counsel of their defaults, there be a suspicion conceived of their
disaffection in Religion, by reason of their absence at such Time as they
should take the said Oaths. 3. Whereas at the first coming of the Sergeants
into the Country, there was special order given, that out of every hundred
men, there should be two chosen to be Sergeants and Corporals, who should be
taught and instructed to exercise the other Soldiers, That they, who are so
chosen accordingly, do at such times as there are no public Trainings, and
when they have best leisure, repair to the Sergeants (who are come out of the
Low Countries to that purpose) to be instructed by them in the duty of their
places, and that as well they, as all other Officers, be very careful to
enable themselves to exercise their Companies when the Sergeants be gone out of
the Country. 4. FOrasmuch as His Majesty, has taken special notice, that a
chief cause of the insufficiency of the trained Bands of this Kingdom,
proceeds from the changing of hatch therefore given commandment, that no
Soldier enrolled, remove his dwelling out of the Town or Parish of his
abode, without License obtained of the Deputy Lieutenant of that Division, to
the end that in case he shall be licensed to depart, that then the Company may
be again made up, and complete both for Number, Persons of active and able
bodies, and men practiced in their Arms; It is therefore straightly commanded,
That all the Soldiers take notice thereof, and be careful in obeying this His
Majesty's Command. 5. FOrasmuch, as there are at this present great
preparations both in Spain and Flanders, as well for Land, as Sea-forces, and
that it is most apparent, that the Enemies of his Majesty's Peace, have some
Designs upon his Highness Kingdoms; and therefore it is fit that every man
be in a readiness upon any sudden alarm: That therefore every Horse man have
always by him in a readin^sse, a pound of Powder, and four and twenty
Bullets: And every Musquetiere, his Bandeliers full of Powder, four and
twenty Bullets, and six yards of Match, to serve upon any sudden Alarm,
until the Magazin of the County may be brought unto them. It is therefore
commanded, that every Soldier have in a readiness by him a Snap-sacke, to
carry his Victuals in: And the said Powder, Match, Bullets, and Snap-sacke, to
be presently provided and daily renewed, as occasion serves, at the charge of
the Towns, or priuatemen, that are charged with the said Arms. And for that
the Pistols, and Harquebusses for Horse men, and the Muskets for Foot men, are
many of them of several Bores, so that the Magazins of the Country cannot
possibly serve them all: That therefore every man who finds any such Arms,
have by him a Melting ladle, a pair of Moulds fit for his Pistol,
Harquebusse, or Musket, according as he finds the same. 6. THat every Officer
and Soldier be always in a readiness, at an hours warning, with his Arms
and provisions, as aforesaid, to repair to his Colors, at such place of
Rendeuous as shall by his Captain be appointed. 7. THat such Beacons as are
in any sort decayed, be forthwith made up and repaired, and that there be
provision of Wood laid by them, for the maintaining and renewing of them, and
that they be diligently watched, by discreet and sufficient men. 8. Whereas
His Maiestic has given express commandment, That there be sufficient
provision of Carriages in readiness, for the conueying of Munition, Victuals,
Baggage, etc. to such Rendeuous, as the Forces of this County shall be
assigned unto; And that to every thousand Soldiers, there be allotted one
hundred Pioners, to be provided with Spades, Pick^xes, Shouels, H^tchets,
Bills, and the like: And that there be Carts and Carriages, and a convenient
number of Nagges appointed, to mount Shot on upon any sudden: And that there
be Posts appointed in several parts of this County, to be sent with
directions from place to place. That therefore the high Constables within their
several Hundreds, do presently warn four sufficient Carts, and twenty
Naggs to every Company of two hundred men, within some of those Towns, where
the said two hundred men are charged to be always in readiness to repair at
an hours warning, to such Rendeuous, as the Captain within that Division
shall appoint his Soldiers to repair unto, letting the Owners of the said
Carts and Horses know, that there is no intention to lay any charge upon them,
but that they shall be fully and reasonably satisfied for any service they
shall perform therein. And that every high Constable do deliver a Note in
writing both to the Deputy Lieutenants near adjoining, and to the Captain of
that Division, as well of the names of the men, whom he has warned to have the
said C^^ts and Naggs, at all times in a readiness, as in what Parishes they
dwell: And that all the petty Constables, and other Inhabitants of every
Parish, take notice hereby of His Majesty's pleasure for appoynting of Posts
in several parts; and that therefore whenever any Letters of Direction shall
come to any of their Parishes, for this His Majesty's important service, that
they forth with, without excuse or delay, furnish the Messengers, who shall
bring any such Letters, with Posthorses from place to place. And that the High
Constables do presently, upon sight hereof, with every Division of two hundred
Soldiers, warn twentieable and sufficient Laborers for Pioners to appear
before the Deputie-Lieutenants next adjoining to that Division, to be enrolled
for Pioners, and that the said Pioners so enrolled, be also ready at an hours
warning, to repair unto such place of Rendeuous, as the Captain within that
Division shall appoint for his Soldiers. And that every Pioner carry with him
to the said place of Rendeuous, his Spade, Pickaxe, Shouell, Hatchet and Bill.
And for that it will be a great charge to the Country, to buy so many Spades,
Pickaxes, and the rest, not knowing certainly, whether there shall be occation
to use them, and that in time they are likely to be lost, That therefore every
high Constable, do take order, that in every Parish where any such Pioner so
enrolled as aforesaid, shall dwell, the Inhabitants of the said Parish shall
either provide for them at their charge, or undertake to have always in a
readiness, at an hours warning, for every Pioner a Spade, Pickaxe, Shouell,
Hatchet and Bill to be paid, if there be use of them by a general charges and
that the said high Constables, give an account to the Deputy Lieutenants next
adjoining, what order the Inhabitants of the said Parishes have taken for
having the said Spades, etc. in a readiness: for that, if an Army should
march, it would be very troublesome for the Carriages, especially of Ordnance,
to travel, in respect of the great decay of High ways in this County; that
therefore the Inhabitants of every Parish, be careful presently to mend their
High ways, and especially to scour their Ditches, and loppe the Trees growing
upon the High ways, that upon any sudden occasion the great defects in the
High ways, be no impediment to the safety and welfare of this Kingdom. 9.
HIs Majesty, out of His Royal and tender care of the peace and safety, as
well of every one of his loving Subjects in particular, as of the whole
Kingdom in general, has given us strict commandment, by several Letters
from the Right Honorable, the Lords of his Counsel, to deal seriously with
the best fort of men, to provide themselves Arms for their particular use,
which accordingly we do hereby pray and desire all persons that have any
thing to lose, seriously to take the same into their consideration, and to
provide themselves of some competent Arms for the defense of their Wives,
Houses, and Families, from the danger of persons ill-affected in Religion, or
otherwise riotous and disorderly, at such times as the trained forces shall be
drawn from the places of their habitation. And therefore that all high
Constables and petty Constables be careful to watch, for to apprehend, and
punish all vagrant and idle persons, as live not in any lawful vocation, and
in times of suspicion and trouble, may either by tales and false tumors,
distract the peoples minds, or by way of fact, commit insolences or outrages,
or minister the occasion by their loose examples, or unlawful combinations,
wherein there may arise much disadvantage to His Majesty's service, and quiet
of the people. And that therefore as well the high and petty Constables, as all
other His Majesty's loving Subjects, do upon the least notice or suspicion of
any such dangerous persons, advertise some Justice of Peace, or
Deputy-Lieutenant, that they may be suppressed, and punished according to their
demerits. 10. THat the high Constables within every several Hundred, do
forthwith send into every parish within their Division, requiring the petty
Constables, with the advice of other the principal Inhabitants of their
Parishes, presently to deliver unto the Justices of Peace, within their
Division, the names and surnames of every able man, from sixteen years old
to threescore; the said Justices being already dealt withal, and desired to
enroll them, and return their names, as aforesaid, unto some of the
Deputy Lieutenants next adjoining. 11. LAstly, That the Sheriff of the County
do send these Orders to all the High Constables within his County, and that
the High Constables do send one of them into every Parish within their
Hundred, and that every petty Constable cause the same to be published amongst
all the Inhabitants of every Parish, and that every Inhabitant who stands
chared with Arms, either Horse or Foot, be particularly made acquainted with
these Orders.
