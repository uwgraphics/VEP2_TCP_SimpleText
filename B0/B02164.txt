To the Right Honorable the Noble Lord Chancellor, and Lords of His Majesty's
Privy Council and Thesaurie, and Lords of the Session, and all who are
entrusted to serve GOD, and his Majesty in Church and State.
OBserve an Old Gentleman, Sir William Campbel, Brother to the Lord of
Elengreg, who came of an Ancient Family, that has seen the Vanities of himself,
in Great and Small, by great Expedience, the Wheelings and Turnings of
Governments; So now take notice seriously, both Church and State, what ye have
seen, and what is Chronicled, and what Conditions that Men should walk on,
assure your selves, GOD will send our Savior to judge you all, in His
Appointed time, There is no Repentance in the Grave! Now the Almighty GOD is
now sifting Men and Nations, but Honest Men should pray to GOD that King
William is sent for Relief to Britain and Ireland, If you miss him, you and
many will be in a mistake, and all Good Subjects; so I leave to you all his
wise Subjects to look to GOD's Glory, and the Kings good.

Therefore. Noblemen and Judges, Tour poor Servant Sir William Campbel being
misfortunat in all his Attempts, and now being Old and very Tender, and has but
a short time in this vain World, and he resolves (GOD willing) to retire
himself to Good Company, to seek. Pardon from GOD for his misspent time: Now
Lords and Judges, I take my leave of you all, fear GOD and keep his
Commandments, Love CHRIST to plead for you, and ye will not be ashamed in this
Life, nor That which is to come; If you please to give me your Charity you may,
for my Cause requires it, I being low, and meeting with Varieties and Troubles
in my Young days and Old.

GOD Bless his Majesty King WILLIAM, and all his good Subjects.

I leave this in Memory
To all of High and Low degree:
Memento Mori.

By Sir William Campbel, Brother to the Lord of Elengreg.
