The Lovesick Maid: Or, Cordelias lamentation for the absence of her Gerhard.
To a pleasant New Tune.




BE gone
Thou fatal fiery feavor, now be gone,
let Love alone,
Let his Etherial flames possess my breast,
His fires,
From thy consuming heat no aid requires,
for swift desires,
Transports my passion to a throne of rest;
Where I,
Who in the pride of health, did
never feel such warmth to move;
By sickness tamed am so inflamed,
I know no joys but love.
And he
That trifled many tedious hours
away, my love to try,
In little space had gained the grace,
to have more power than I.
Depart
Thou scorching fury, quick from me depart,
think not my heart,
To thy dull flame shall be a sacrifice;
A Maid
Dread Cupid now is on thy Altar laid,
by thee betrayed,
A Rich oblation to restore thine eyes:
But yet
My fair acknowledgement will
prove thou have no c^aft,
To bend thy Bow against thy foe,
that aimed to catch the shall:
For if
That at my breast thy arrows
thou all at once let his,
She that receives a thousand sheaves,
can do no more but due.
(...) No more
you learned physicians, tire your brains no more
pray give me over,
Mine is a cure, in Physic never read;
Although
You skilful Doctors all the world does know,
pray let me go.
You may as well make practice on the Dead.
But if
My Gerrard dain to view me
with the glory of his looks,
I make no doubt to live without
Physicians and their books.
It Is he
That with his balmed Kisses
can restore my latest breath;
That bliss is this, to gain a Kiss
can save a maid from death?
To you
That tell me of another world, I bow,
and will allow
Your Sacred Precepts, if you will grant me this,
That he
Whom I esteem of next the Deity,
may go with me,
Without whose presence there can be no bliss,
Go teach
Your tenets of eternity;
to those that aged be,
And not persuade a lovesick maid
there is any heaven but he.
But stay
Methinks an icy slumber
has possesst my frency brain;
Pray did him dye if you see I
(...) The Young- Man's Answer: Or, his Dying Breath, Lamenting for his fair
Cordelias Death.
To a Delightful New Tune.


Come on
thou fatal messenger from her that is gone
left I alone
Within that quenchless flame for ever fry;
The Lake
Of love being kindled, wherein none can take
rest, but wake,
Where slumber has no power to close the eye;
Whilst I
That by my fair Cordelia
desire to take a sleep,
With lids wide spread upon my bed
am forced a watch to keep:
And she
That waited many tedious hours,
my constancy to try,
Is now at rest, while I oppressed,
fain would but cannot dye.
Dispatch
Thou scorching fury, quickly now dispatch,
by Death I watch.
To be releast from this tormenting flame;
The Dart
Sent from dread Cupid, sticks fast in my heart,
I wanting art,
Had not the power for to resist the fame
Though she
Who by her late acknowledgment,
professed thou had no craft,
Yet from thy bow thou madst her know
what power lay in the shaft:
Yut then
Thou sent'st another arrow
which me of hopes be rest,
Most like a so to wound me so,
for whom no cure (...)
(...) Wherefore
Did you Physicians give my mistress over
had you no more
Experience, but what you in books have read;
Or why
(You learned Doctors) did you cease to try
your skills, when I
Might have revived her if she would not been dead?
And yet
Suppose that I in Person
had present been to view her;
Is there such grace in any face
to work so great a cure?
But now
I Am come too late to kiss her,
which were it not in vain,
After her death I Would spend my breath
to fetch her back again.
Unto
The fair Elysium thither will I go,
whereas I know
She is amonghst those sacred ones preferred,
Then I
Shall be admitted for to come so nigh,
pardon I Will cry
For my long absence, wherein I have erred:
And since
By her I was esteemed
so much on earth being here,
Hence for her sake no rest I Will take,
till I have found her there.
No more,
But only I desire
to hear my passing bell;
That Virgins may lament the day
