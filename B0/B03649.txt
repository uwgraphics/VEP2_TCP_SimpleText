[1]
ONE Evening, in hot weather,
I through a Grove did pass,
And saw two Maids together,
sit sporting on the grass:
I stood a while and eyed them,
They little thought who spied them.
Whilst they were imitating
What I Will forbear relating.
[2]
When their Pastime was over,
I gently trod the green,
To surprise them and discover,
that their Frollick I had seen:
The one more nimble sighted
She run as if she was frighted;
The other not surmizing,
I caught her just a Rising.
[3]
And down again I plucked her,
whilst she cried fie upon it;
And quickly did instruct her
In what young Maidens want.
The other at a distance,
Came not to her assistance;
But stamping, stood and said,
Ah Moll, you're a wicked Jade.
[4]
You foolish Girl, come hither
And do as I have done;
I Am sure that you had rathes
be kissed, than let alone:
He has gotten in his Breeches
For Maids, a bag of Riches,
Which when you have in possession,
You Will think it no transgression.
[5]
With that the Wench drew nigher,
and I to meet her run;
Whose heart was set on fire
with standing to look on.
I on the grass did throw her,
And soon began to show her,
The pleasing toil of Nature,
That Is loved by every Creature.
[6]
She every moment kissed me,
and claspt me in her Arms;
And cried, ye powers assist me,
to exercise new Charms,
Whilst we our Joys were sharing,
The other she sat staring;
Which put me in mind to think on,
How the Devil looked over Lincoln.
[7]
When our delights were over
she blushing to me cried,
Good Sir, do not discover
what freedoms you have enjoyed,
For when my Mistress knows it,
She Will take me to her Closet,
And beats me in her Anger
For kissing with a stranger.
[8]
I all assurance gave her,
I Would keep it in my breast;
She asked me if I Would have her,
I answered yes in Jest:
The other in a fury:
Cried, Oh you idle Whore you,
He Is a Man that I have right in,
And so they fell to fighting.
