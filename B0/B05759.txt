The Seamans adieu to his Dear.
This Man was pressed to serve upon the Seat.
Which did his Dearest very sore displease,
She importuned the Captain on her knee,
And proffered gold to have her love set free,
But all would not prevail, The Captains ear
Was deaf, the Maids complaints he would not hear,
When no entreaty could move his hard heart,
She sadly took her leave and so they part.
To the Tune of, I Will go to Sir Richard, etc.




Man Come all loyal lovers, that is faithful and true
observe me whever you be,
A pattern I here have prsented to you,
It is good to be constant you see.
But chiefly to thee (my own Dearest) I speak,
with patience my absence to bear,
For now I am pressed, to serve on the Seas
and I must bid adieu to my Dear.
Our King must have Seamen and Soldiers more stout,
his enemies hearts for to fear,
And I for my honor will venture about,
and I must bid adieu to my Dear.

Maid. O tell me not so (my own Dearest) I pray,
for loves sake take pity on me,
I Will do my endeavor to please thee always,
if that I may but have my Love free.
It Is far better staying with me on the shore
where pleasures and joys do abound.
Then for to no venture, where Cannons do roar
in the depths of the Seas to be drowned,
O be not so cruel my to be for to slight.
but tarry (my Dearest) with me,
We Will find out a way in loves wars for to fight,
and I Will strive for to set my love free.

Man. All that thou can do (my Love) will not procure
my freedom I sorely do fear,
But I must the hardship of service endure,
and I must bid adieu to my Dear.
My Captain by no means will let me go free
he likes me so well I do hear,
Therefore its in bain to beg my liberty,
for I must bid adieu to my Dear.

The Second Part
to the same Tune.






Maid. I Will go to thy Captain and fall on my knees,
perhaps he will take pity on me,
If five pounds on ten pounds will buy thy discharge
he shall have it to set my love free.

Captains answer. Not ten pounds nor twenty shall buy his discharge
fair maid you must patiently bear,
He shall go to Sea, for his king to engage,
and he must bid adieu to his Dear.
I Will have him to serve me upon the salt main
in battle with foes for to fight,
Then cease pretty Maiden, and do not complain,
for the wars is a Soldiers delight.

Maid. Behold (noble Captain) these sorrowful tears
which down my cheeks trickles amain,
To move your hard heart to release me of fear,
and to grant me my love once again.
No Maidens heart ever was fuller of woe,
then good sir take pity on me,
And let him no further unto the wars go
but be pleased to set my Love free.

Captain. O cease thy suit Damosel and be not so sad,
let reason thy must now assuage
Ten thousand such Seamen ere long must be had,
all against the proud foes to engage.

Man. My dearest why do thou the Captain offend,
I am see he by no means will yield,
I am now resolved my blood for to spend,
upon the salt Seas or in field;
Therefore be contented and cease thy said moans,
take comfort and do not thou tear,
If fortune befriend me when as I am gone,
I shall once again see my own Dear.

Maid. My dearest since thou must be parted from me,
and here must no longer remain
The thoughts of thy love all my comfort shall be
until I do see thee again.
Each hour for thy welfare, to God I will pray,
that he will in safety preserve,
My one dearest Lover by night and by day,
whilst he on the Ocean does serve.
This token I prithee love for my sake keep,
remember me, when you it wear,
This parting kiss take, which does force me to w^ep
and so heavens bless my own Dear.

Man. Adieu my dear Jewel, thy love I have found,
thy parting does grieve me full sore,
The drums they do beat, I the trumpets do sound,
and I must stay no longer on shore.
