Fair LUCINA Conquered By Prevailing Cupid.
She that triumphed in disdain, at last was forced to yield,
And of her self she thus complained when Cupid wonn the Field:
Though at the first I was unkind, yet now I Will loving be,
And that my Coridon shall find if he will return to me.
When Coridon did hear these words, he did most joyfully
Embrace his kind, and dearest Love; and they did both agree.
To the Tune of, Jenny Gin. or, the fair one let me in.

LUcina sitting in her Bower
was wounded with a dart,
Ascending from the secret power
which smote her to the heart:
Immediately she thus did cry,
who can my comforts spell?
Who can compel me for to love

Quoth Cupid I will humble thee,
and will subdue thy pride,
I Will make thee now submit to me,
it shall not be denied:
I Will send such Arrows to thy heart,
proceeding from my bow,
Shall make thee feel love's fatal smart

Quoth she, I did design to live
a Maiden until Death,
But now thou have so wounded me,
alas I pant for breath?
Thou pretty Nymph be not unkind
to cast love quite away,
I will be loyal thou shall find
unto my dying day.
Sweet Coridon's deluding tongue
has so ensnared my mind,
That in Loves-firy flames I burn,
and can no comfort find:
I slighted him who was my Love,
and held him in disdain,
But now my ruin it does prove,
in vain I may complain.
What sweet expressions did he use
my favor to obtain;
But I his kindness did abuse,
by foul and gross disdain,
For now I languish here in grief,
and can no comfort see,
Kind Death afford me some relief,
make haste and set me free.
O proud ambition, why did I
his kindness thus reject,
Who loved me so tenderly,
and showed me such respect:
A Princely presence, graced with Fa(...)
