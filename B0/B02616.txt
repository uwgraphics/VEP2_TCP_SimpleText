Mr. Hampdens Speech, occasioned upon the Londoners Petition for PEACE.
BUt will you now to peace incline,
And languish in the maine design,
and leave us in the lurch.
I would not Monarchy destroy,
But only as the way to enjoy,
the ruins of the Church.
Is not the Bishops Bill denied,
And we still threatened to be tried?
you see the King embraces
Those counsels he approved before,
Nor does he promise which is more
that we shall have their places.
Did I for this bring in the Scot,
(For it is no secret now) the plot
was Says and mine together;
Did I for this return again?
And spent a winter then in vain
once more t'invite them hither.
Though more our money then our cause
Their brotherly assistance draws,
my labor was not lost;
At my return I brought you thence
Necessity my strong pretense,
and this shall quit your cost.
Did I for this my Country bring,
To help their Knight against their King,
and raise the first division;
Yet I the business did decline
Though I contrived the whole design,
and taught them to petition.
So many nights spent in the City
In that invisible Committee,
the wheel that governs all;
From thence the change in Church and State
And all the mischiefs bears their date
from Haberdashers Hall.
Did we force Ireland to despair?
Upon the King to cast the war,
to make the world abhor him;
Because the Rebels used his name,
Though we our selves can do the same,
while both alike are for him.
Then the same fire we kindle here
Whilst we pretend to quench that there,
and wisely lost that Nation;
To do as crafty beggars use
To maine themselves only to abuse
the simple man's compassion.
Have I so often past between
Winsor and Westminster unseene?
and did my self divide,
To keep his Excellence in awe,
And give the Parliament the Law,
for they knew none beside.
Did I for this take pains to teach
Our zealous ignorance to preach,
and did their lungs inspire;
Read'em their texts, showed them their parts
And taught them all their little arts
to fling abroad the sire.
Sometimes to beg, sometimes to threaten,
Then say the Cavaleers are beaten,
and stroke the peoples ears.
And straight when victories grow cheap,
And will no more advance the heap,
to raise the price of fears.
And now the books, and now the bells,
And now our arts the Preacher tells
to edify the people;
All our Divinity is news,
And we have made of equal use
the Pulpit and the Steeple.
And shall we kindle all this flame,
Only to put it out again,
and must we now give ore.
And only end where we begun,
In vain this mischief we have done,
if we can do no more.
If men in peace may have their right,
Where is this necessity to fight,
and break both law and oath?
Who say that they fight for the cause,
(...) to defend the King and Laws,
But 'ti^ (...)them both.
Either the cause at fir^^ (...)
Or being good it is so still,
and thence they will in^^^erre;
That either now, or at the first
They were deceived, or which is worst
that we our selves may err.
But plague and famine will come in,
For they and we are near of kin,
and cannot go asunder;
For while the wicked starve indeed,
The Saints have ready at their need
Gods providence and plunder.
Princes we are if we prevail,
And gallant villains if we fail,
when to our fame it is told,
It will not be our least of praise,
When our new state we could not raise,
we have destroyed the old.
Then let us slay, fight, and vote
Till London be not worth a groat,
oh it is a patient Beast,
When we have gal'd and tired that mule,
And can no longer have the rule,
we will have our spoil at least.
FINIS.
