SWeet Heavens have been pleased
of late to show
How Stars and Comedies
in mourning go,
For my sweet Darling bright,
Wherein was my delight,
To Heaven took his flight,
And left me here.
Oh that his Charlot free
had been so strong
For to have taken me
with him along;
My sweet Clustrious Babe
As ever woman had,
His last good night have made,
Opitty me.
His Cr^mso^ ^ooks so sweet,
his Lilly hand;
Methinks I see him yet
by me to stand,
His shadow with me still
My grieved heart does kill.
But unto Heavens will
We must obey
When late he was in France,
his comely Grace
My spirits did advance
to see his face:
And constant was to me
A seemed Deity;
Joy and Felicity
I had in him
the Second Part,
to the same tune.
HIs comely gestures fed
me with delight,
When that his person did
appear in my sight,
Whose Princely looks did fly
Like Come^s from the s^y,
'I would make a heart to (...)
(...)e.
Why Heavens, were you (...)
so with delight.
To take my Prince so soon
out from my sight:
Methinks I see his Ghost,
Swiftly to Heaven post,
Dear Henry I have lost
O pity me.
His Princely piety,
his godly zeal,
The holy defties,
would not conceal,
But down from Heaven they
Ascend in one d^y,
And fetch my Dear away,
O pity me.
Angels would have it so,
for they decreed,
He needs away must go,
and withal speed,
A Prince with them to be,
In Ammortallity,
For everlastingly
With them to Reign.
Yet whatsoever place,
I walk or stand,
Methinks I see his face
close by my hand,
His shadow I do see,
Wherever I shall be,
Unto Eternity.
He was so sweet.
O let all Nations be
sad for the Prince,
For which no remedy
cannot be since,
Angels rejoice me know,
While that me mourn below,
To Heavens see me go
Then to my Dear.
O that I could but fly
Like to the Dove,
Even up to the Sky
to find my Love.
Then would I enter in
Amongst the Cherubims,
To see my d^arest friend
That was so sweet
O death why did thou send
Thy ^art so soon,
Could thou not hold thy hand,
fill I came home,
To have received one smile
From my own dearest child,
Before his last exile,
But now he is gone.
O Heavens may you be
to me so kind,
And grant some remedy
unto my mind,
Which now oppressed is,
My vitalls does deercase,
My grief transcending is,
O pity me
When I to England shall
now take my way,
My comfort is but small;
yet all my joy
Is in this Gracious King,
My blessing be on him,
When I do come again,
Lord succor me.
