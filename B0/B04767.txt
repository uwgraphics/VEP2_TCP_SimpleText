A Politic CONFESSION OF FAITH: Calculated for the Meridian of both CHURCHES.
So as Reading each Column by it self, it Suits with the belief of the most
Zealous Papist, but putting both together, as one Line, Agrees with the Tenets
of every Good Protestant.
Composed for the Assistance of weak Catholics, in the necessary Art of
Equivocation.
Quo teneam Protea Nodo.


I Still will Stick
To Catholic
Holding for Faith
What Rome's Church says,
Beyond whose Pale,
All truth does fail,
Doubting, I repair
To's Holiness Chair,
And Bow my Knees
To Images
Where Kings are Head,
The Flocks misled
To Saints I pray,
It Is the right way,
Gods Word I keep,
From simple Sheep,
And hold no wrong
In a strange Tongue
Dread Purgatory jayl
It Is no idle Tail,
Prayers, and Pence,
May Bail us thence,
Priests are Ill-sped,
Who dare to Wed,
My Creed Consents
Seven Sacraments,
Where the Altar's dressed,
People are Blessed,
And he is an Ass
Who shuns the Mass
To the Reformed way,
Adieu, It leads astray;
What Englands Church avows,
My Conscience Disallows:
Pure Doctrine's only Sown,
Where the Popes power men own:
To Scriptures Decision,
I Answer with Derision;
To the Laws of my Prince,
Paying small Reverence;
Subjects are not to blame,
To think the Pope Supreme:
What Worship can be true.
That is accounted New:
Free from all Superstitions,
I defend old Traditions:
In The Common Prayer, who says
Amen, has a strange Faith:
I value not a Pin,
To Act a venial sin:
Merits I allow,
The People will have it so:
Who do Assert Confession,
Honor most their Profession:
The Cup to the Layety,
It Is sure Impiety:
Service is scarce Divine,
With Table, Bread, and Wine:
Who that Communion flies,
Is Catholic and Wise,


FINIS.
