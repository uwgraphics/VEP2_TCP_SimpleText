A Pleasant new Ballad, to sing Evening and Morn, Of the bloody Murder of S^r
John Barlycorn,
The tune is, Shall I lie beyond thee.


AS I went through the North Country
I heard a merry meeting,
A p^eas^nt toy and full of joy
two Noblemen were greeting,
And as they walked forth to sport,
upon a Summers day
They met another Noble man
with whom they would had a fray.
His name was Sir John Barlycorn,
he dwelt down in a V^le
And had a Kinsman dwelt with him,
they called him Thomas Good Ale.
Then one named Sir Richard Beer
was re^dy at that t^me,
And l^kewise came a busy P^er
cal^'d Sir William W^ite-wine.
Some of them fought in a black Jack,
some of them in a Can,
But yet the chiefest in a black Pot
fought like a Noble man:
Sir Barlycorn fought in a bowl,
who won the victory,
Which made them all to chafe and swear,
that Barlicorn should dye
Some said him kill, some said him drown,
some wished to hang him high,
For those that followed Barlycorn
they said would b^ggers dye,
Then with a p^ow they plowed him up,
and thus they did Devise
To bu^^ him quick within the Earth
and swore he should not rise.
With harrows strong they came to him
and burst clods o^ his head,
jo^fu^ banq^et then was made,
when Barlycorn was dead.
He rest^d still upon the Earth,
till rain from sky did fall,
Then he grew up on branches green.
which sore amazed them all,
Increasing thus till Midsomer,
he made them all afear'd,
For he sprang up on high
and got a goodly beard
When ripening to St. James-tide,
his countenance waxed wan,
Yet now full grown in parter strength.
and thus became a man,
Wherefore with hooks and sickles keen
unto the field they hy'd,
They cut his legs off by the knees
and limb from limb divide.
Then bloodily they cut him down,
from place where he did stand,
And like a thief for treachery
they bound him in a band,
So then they took him up again,
according to his kind,
And plac d him up in several stakes
to wither with the wind.
Then with a pitchfork sharp and long
they rent him to the heart.
And traytor-like for treason vile
they bound him in a Cart.
And tending him with weapons strong
unto the town they high,
Whereas they mowed him in a Mow
and so they let him lie.
They left him groaning by the walls
till all his wounds were sore,
And having took him up again,
they cast him on a floor,
And hired two with holly Clubs
to beat at him at once,
Who thwackt so hard on Barlicorn
the flesh fell from his bones,
Then after took him up again,
to please some women's mind,
Yea dust^d, fand, and si^ted him,
till he was almost bind.
Fu^l fast they kit him in a sack,
which grieved him very sore,
And soundly steep^ him in a fat,
for three days space and more,
From whence again they took him out
and laid him forth to dry,
Then cast him on a Chamber floor
and swore that he should Dye,
They rubbed and stird him up and down
and often did toil and ture.
The Malt-man likewise vows his death
his body should be sure,
They pul^d and hol'd him yet up in spite,
and threw him on a Kill,
Y^a dry^d him on fire hot
the more to work their will,
Then to the Mill they forced him straight
whereas they bruise his bones.
The Miller swore to murder him
betwixt a pair of stones.
The last time when they took him up
and served him worse then that,
For with hot scalding liquor store
they washed him in a fat.
But not content with this God wot
they wrought him so much harm.
With cruel threat they promise next
to beat him into barm,
And lying in this danger deep,
for fear that he should quarrel,
They heaved him straight out of the fat
and turned him in the barrel,
They cor'd and broached it with a Tap
so thus hi^ Death began,
And drew out every Dram of blood
whilst any drop would run.
Some brought in Iacks upon their backs
some brought Bowl and paile,
Yea every man some weapon had
poor Barlicorn to kill.
When Sir John Good Ale heard of this,
he came with mickle might,
And took by strength their tongues away
their legs and eke their sight.
Sir John at last in his respect,
so paid them all their hire,
Then some lay bleeding by the walls
some tumbling in the mire.
Some sadly droaning by the walls
some fell ith strets down right,
The wisest of them scarcely knew
what he had done ore night.
All you'good wives that brew good Ale,
God keep you from all teen,
But if you put too much water in,
the Devil put out your Eyne.
FINIS.
