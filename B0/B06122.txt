TO THE KINGS Most Excellent Majesty.
The Humble Address of the Society of the Middle Temple.
DREAD SOVEREIGN,
WIth hearts full of unspeakable Joy we presume to approach Your Royal
presence, and with all our Souls bless Almighty GOD for the late wonderful
Discovery of the hellish Conspiracy begun and carried on by desperate Persons
of Fanatical, Atheistical and Republican Principles, who impudently assuming to
themselves the Name of True Protestants and Patriots, did at first by Popular
Insinuations and other Ar^ifices, project the undermining the best Religion and
Government in the World; and afterward being therein prevented by Your
Majesty's unwearied Care and admirable Conduct, proceeded to contrive the
Horrid Paricide of Your Sacred Person, the Barbarous Assassination of Your
Royal Brother, the dear partaker ot Your Sufferings, the Involving these
Nations in Blood and Confusion, and the utter destruction of this Monarchy.

As this Society has been Eminent for its Loyalty and early Tokens of Duty and
Affect on, particularly in their humble Thanks for Your Gracious Declaration,
and their Abhorrence of the late Accursed and Traitorous Association, which we
look upon to be a part ot this Damnable Conspiracy, so we shall do our utmost
to bring the Viliains to Justice, especially those of this Society, who to our
great Sorrow are in the number of the Conspirators.

And We do repeat our Solemn Protestations to stand by and Defend Your Sacred
Majesty and lawful Successors with our Lives and Fortunes, and beseech Almighty
God to cover with Confusion the Faces of Your most secret Enemies, that Divine
Vengeance may overtake such of the Traitors as by flight escape the Justice of
Humane Laws, whose Guilt proclaims it self so loud, that they dare not trust
even that Mercy of which they have had so long Experience. And as Providence
did never so signalize it self on behalf of any Prince, as of Your Majesty,
through the whole course of Your Reign, so may Heaven shower down and continue
its best Blessings on the best of Kings, and be never weary of working new
Miracles for Your Preservation.

John Bernard, Speaker.
