THE CASE OF THE Promoter of the Bill for Erecting a Court of Conscience for
the Tower Hamblets, comprehended within the weekly Bills, of Mortality, etc.
THat Mr John Caine, ancient Inhabitant, and yet living within the Tower
Hamblets, for nigh fourteen years last past, has concerned himself in
endeavoring to obtain an Act of Parliament, for Erecting a Court of
Conscience, for the abovementioned Tower Hamblets; and has been at great
Pains and Charge, and often, and manifold attendences, Soliciting for the
passing a Bill, for the said Court of Conscience in the several preceding
Parliaments, but by the sudden Adjurnments, Prorogations and Dissolutions of
the said Parliaments, his endeavors missed of desired effect, to the Damage of
the said Undertaker, who now upon a fresh encouragement, and the Request of
several of the Inhabitants, of the aforesaid Tower Hamblets, the matter is
brought to such an Issue.

That the Bill lying before the House of Parliament, likely to pass into an
Act, there being several Persons unknown, to the Undertaker, Petitioning and
making their Application, to have their names inserted, as Clerk and Register of
the Tower Hamblets, although they have not been at one Penny expense, nor taken
the least Pains in the management of it, etc.

The Undertaker does humbly refer himself, to the Honor and Justice of this
Honorable House, and hopes and prays, as a recompense, of his Trouble and
Charge, and as an Encouragement for the future to others, to undertake things
of the like nature for a public good, that he may obtain the name of Evan
Christian, Barrester at Law, his Son in Law, to be incerted in the Tower
Division, as Register and Clerk, he being a person of unquestionable Honesty
and Integrity, and also sufficiently quallified for the said Office.
