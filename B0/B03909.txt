Jockies Lamentation, Whose seditious work was the loss of his Country, and
his KIRK.
To a stately new Scottish Tune.


WHen first the Scottish wars began
The English man did lead the van,
with musket and pike
The bonny blithe and cunning Scot
Had laid a plot, but we could not
smell out the like,
Although he could neither write read,
Yet General Lashly past the Tweed
With his gay gang of blew-caps tall,
Along we marched with our General,
New Castle we took all in a trice,
And thought for to make it our Paradise
And then we were gallant and gay
For why we took the pillage away.
Then straight to plundering we did fall,
Of great and small, for we were all
most valiant that day.
And Jenny in her silken gown,
The best in Town from foot to Crown
was bonny and gay;
Our suits and our silks did make such a smother
That hardly next day we know one another;
For Jocky, he was wondrous fine,
And Jenny in her silks did shine
For there ice did get me a Beaver then
But now it is beat to a cap again;
For a Red coat took every ragge
What Jocky now and Jenny must bag.
The English raised an Army straight
With mickle state, and we did wait
to charge them all,
Then every valiant musket-man
Put fire in pan, that we began
apace to fall:
For when that the powder was touched by the cols
Then every man did pay for his pole
For the Red-coat the battle won,
And Jocky fast to Scotland did run,
And at Dunbar-fight, a well an aneer,
For there we were put into mickle fear;
They took our guns and silver all,
And hung our silks in Westminster Hall.
Full well I wot in Lancashire
Our brethren dear, did plunder there
both rich and poor,
Which caused the fury of the North
When we set forth, to be in wroth,
and vex us sore,
For when that the Red-coats had knocked us down
Did beat Jocky over the face
And was not this a pitiful case?
They bid us remember our plundering tricks,
And thumpt us and bumpt us with cudgels and sticks
But the Deel brust my body and wem
If ever Ice gang to England again




PRince Rupert he at Marston-moor
In time of yore, did bang us sore
being forced to fly
Had not it been, for English men
To charge again the battle then
and victory,
Was bravely gained by our General,
But Lashly did run with his blew-caps all;
At Horthams Town appeared a sprite,
For Jocky had rather eat than fight
Their legs they were weary with running so last
And yet the bold Caveys were routed at last;
And Jocky never so frighted had been
Who thought it secure to keep a whole skin,
The godly Presbyterian
That holy man a war began,
in Scotland there,
Then Jocky gay, both Lord and Lad
Like people mad, were very glad
in arms to appear;
They made a new Covenant for to pull down
The Crosses that stood in every Town
And the Rochet that the Bishop did bear
And the white smock his Chaplin did wear,
But now the good Covenant's gone to rack,
And quite out of date like an old Almanac,
And all the Crosses are our own loss
For Jocky's gone home by weeping-cross.
The Red-coats all came over Fife,
With mickle strife, and ventured life
our bloods to tame
Brunt-Island we were forced to yield
For in the field great store were killed
as Ice can name,
At least five hundred Scots were slain
Besides two thousand were prisoners taken,
Which made the gay Girls sigh and cry
To see their sweet-hearts lying by;
The High-Landers having so mickle a reach
Did find that the pellets did light in their breech
For the Red-coats did often let fly
And Jocky for quarter did presently cry.
Our enemies to Starling-brig
(Like a whirligig did dance a Jig)
to fight our men
To England straight, with mickle pride
We cross the Tweed, and were agreed
to charge again;
At Worster our Kirk and our King went to rack
And he that run foremost durst never look back
Our mickle army had the rout
And there we were forced to wheel about,
The silver before which from England we took
Is now their own money Ice swear on a book
But since that England and Scotland were foes
They keep up their silver, and pay us with blows.
The Low-lands all, and High-lands too
And bonnet blew Ice yield to you,
to be your own
For Red coats they with gun and sword
Makes every Lord with one accord
to cry, O hone.
Our lives and our wives, our goods and lands
For Jocky must a servant be,
And Jenny live as poor as he
Our horses, cattle, sheep and cowes,
Our carts and harrows, teams and plows,,
We may not challenge for our own,
For Jocky has little, and Jenny has none.
I must confess this holy firk.
Did only work upon our Kirk,
for silver and meat
Which made us come and bring our broods
Venture our bloods for your own goods
which proved a cheat
But see what covetousness does bring
We have lost our Kirk, and every thing,
Then alack sir, and well we may cry
Our back sir and belly must dye,
We fought for treasure, and not for glory
And there is an end of a Scottish story,
Despised of all for silver and gold,
Oh the worst tale that ever was told,
S. S.
