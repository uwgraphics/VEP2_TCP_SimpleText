Londons Ordinary, Or every man in his humor.
To a pleasant new Tune.


THrough the Royal Exchainge as I walked,
Where Gallants in satin do shine:
At midst of the day they parted away
To seauerall places to dine.
The Gentry went to the Kings head,
The Nobls unto the Crown:
The Knights went to the Golden Fleece,
And the Plough men to the Clown.
The Clergy will dine at the Miter,
The Vintners at the three Tons:
The Usurers to the Devil will go
And the Friars to the Nuns.
The Ladies will dine at the Feathers
The Globe no Captain will scorn:
The Hunts men will go to the Gray hound below
And some Towns men to the Horn.
The Plummers will dine at the Fountain,
The Cooks at the holly Lamb:
The Drunkerds by noone to the Man in the Moon,
And the Cuckolds to the Ram.
The Roarers will dine at the Lion.
The Water men at the old Swan:
And Bawdes will to the Negro go,
And Whores to the naked Man.
The Keepers will to the white Heart,
The Merchants unto thn Ship:
The Beggars they must take their way
To the Egg shell and the Whippe.
The Farryers will to the Horse,
The Black smith unto the Lock:
The Butchers unto the Bull will go
And the Carmen to Bridewll docke.
The Fish mongers unto the Dolphin,
The Barbers to the Cheat loaf:
The Turners unto the Ladle will go
Where they may merrily quaffe.
The Tailors will dine at the Sheeres,
The Shoe makers will to the Boot:
The Welshmen they will take their way
And dine at the sign of the Got.
The Second part.
To the same Tune.


THe Hosiers will dine at the Leg,
The drapers at the sign of the Brush:
The Fletchers to Rodin hood will go
And the Spendthrift to Beggars Bush:
The Pewterers to the Quarte pot,
The Coopers will dine at the Hoope:
The Cobblers to the Last will go
And the Barge men to the Scoope.
The Carpenters will to the Axe,
The Coliers will dine at the Sack:
Your Fruterer he to the Cherry tree
Good fellows no liquor will lack.
The Gold smith will to the three Cups,
For money they hold it as dross:
Your Puritan to the Pewter can
And your Papists to the Cross.
The Weauers will dine at the Shuttele,
The Glouers will unto the Glove:
The Maidens all to the Maiden head
And true Lovers unto the Dove.
The Sadlers will dine at the Saddle,
The Painters will to the green Dragon:
The Dutchmen will go to the Froe,
Where each man will drink his Flagon.
The Chandlers will dine at the Skales,
The Salters at the sign of the Bag:
The Porters take pain at the Labor in vain
And the Horse courser to the white Nagge.
Thus every man in his humor,
That comes from the North or the South:
But he that has no money in his purse,
May dine at the sine of the Mouth,
The Swaggerers will dine at the Fencers,
But those that have lost their wits:
With Bedlam Tom let that be their home,
And the Drum the drummers best fits.
The Cheter will dine at the Checker,
The Pick pockets in a blind Ale house:
Tell on and tried then up Holborne they ride
And they their end at the Gallows.
Finis.
