Beautiful MOGGY: OR, Scotch JEMMY's Delight. BEING A brief Account of a late
Wooing and Wedding at the City of Edinborough.
To the Tune of The Female Trooper. Licensed according to Order.

^

I.
MOggy full as blithe and gay
As Flora in the Month of May;
Beautified with all the Charms of Love,
As ever Female boasted of.
Jemmy went this Lass to Woo,
With Swerd, and Belt, and Bonnet blue;
With a noble Feather neat and trim,
Scarce a Scottish Lord was like to him.
Prithee be free, my Dear, said he,
For to suffer me to lig by thee,
Till next day Noon; she answered soon,
Ise will never yield to sike a Loon.
II.
Moggy I has Gold and Pearl,
The which Ise freely give my Girl;
Rings, and Jewels, nay, and all that is mine,
For the blessed minute I Would resign;
Therefore do not answer no,
But muccle Love and Kindness show;
For thy Beauty does my Heart surprise,
It is wounded by those charming Eyes;
Thy Beauty bright is my Delight,
For the sake of which the World I slight;
Sike Lass as thee Ise never see,
Dearest, be but loving, kind, and free.
III.
Ise a Lord of muccle Fame,
Who from the Town of Glascow came,
For to kiss and court my charming fair,
With whom the World cannot compare:
Grant me but a Night's Repose,
Close by thy side, my blushing Rose,
Till the Morning Sun does gild the Grove,
Where we will both dissolve in Love;
There in my Arms, Cupids Alarms,
Shall invite us to those tempting Charms,
Which shall agree with thee and me,
And next Morning both we'll Married be.
IV.
Jemmy prithee now forbear,
Ise can avoid thy tempting Snare;
For I tell thee there is not a Loon,
That shall attain my Love so soon:
Though you are a Scottish Lord,
Your Glory Ise will not regard,
Never any shall lig by my side,
Till Ise be made a lawful Bride:
Should you obtain, what you would fain,
Ise alas! in Sorrow might remain;
Yet ever I Will try your Constancy,
Here a Maiden I will live and dye.
V.
Jemmy found he could not have,
What he so earnestly did crave;
This his Loyal Love enflamed the more,
So that her Charms he did adore,
And strait he gave her Heart and Hand,
No longer they disputing stand,
But unto the Kirk resolved to go,
Since she was free it should be so:
Scotch Lairds was there, and Ladies fair,
Yet not any Beauty could compare,
With the sweet Bride, who Thousands eyed,
Counting her the Scottish Kingdom's Pride.
FINIS.
