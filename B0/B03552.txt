The Longing Shepherdess OR Laddy lie near me.
(...) the Tune of, Laddy lie near me: Or The Green Garter.




ALl in the Month of May,
when all things blossom,
As in my bed I lay,
sleep it grew loathsome:
Up I rose and did walk
over yon mountains,
Through Medows, and through Dales,
over rocks and fountains.
I heard a voice to say,
sweet heart come cheer me,
Thou have been long away,
Laddy lie near me.
Down by yon River side,
and surging Billows,
A pleasant Grove I espide,
well set with willowes,
In it a shepherdess,
singing most clearly,
And still her note it was,
Laddy lie near me.
Come away, do not stay,
sweet heart and cheer me:
Thou have been long away,
dearest draw near me.
Sweet heart thou stayest too long,
Phoebe is watching,
Aurora with her steed,
is fast aproaching,
She does her Chariot mount,
which much does fear me,
Each hour a year I count,
till thou lie near me.
Come away, do not stay,
sweetheart and cheer me,
Thou have been long away,
(...)est d(...) near (...)
Hymen keeps Holy day,
Love take thy pleasure,
Cupid has thrown away,
both Bow and Quiver:
Boreas does gently blow,
least I should fear him,
Yet dare I not to stay,
alone too near him.
Come away do not stay,
sweetheart and cheer me,
Thou have been long away,
Laddy lie near me.
Do not Adonis like,
sweet heart fly from me,
For careful I will be,
as does become me,
Both of my flock and thine,
whilst they are feeding,
Dear is my love to thee,
as is exceeding.
Come away do not stay,
sweetheart and cheer me,
Thou have been long away,
Laddy lie near me.
I may sing Welladay
my joys are ended,
The hour of my approach,
is almost spended.
My Parents will me miss,
and swains will ieere me,
Thus still her note it was,
Laddy lie near me.
Come away, do not stay,
sweetheart and cheer me

O Come my own Dear lets dally a while
with q fala la la la la la,
thou have aicken'd my Spirits now with a smile
nd thy fa la la la la la la,
be trembling of thy Lips do show,
Thou have no power to say me no,
Which makes me have a months mind unto
thy fa la la la la la la,
This hearty kiss is a sign thou will yield,
to thy fa la, etc.
The white of thy eye speaks peace in the Field
with a fa la, etc.
Then for a veil to hide thy face,
I Will cloud thee with a sweet embrace,
There Is many would wish that they were in thy place
with their fa la, etc.
Oh do not sigh to hear me entice,
with a fa la, etc.
Thou nere had bin got, had thy Mother bin nice
with her fa la, etc.
Then prithee put me out of my pain,
For I am now in a merry vain,
Lets play at that game, where the loosers do gain
with their fa la, etc.
But oh my own dear, why lie thou so still?
with thy fa la, etc.
Art thou in a swound, or what is thy will,
with thy fa la, etc.
I prithee joy take no such grief
Since I am so near to thy relief,
Oh, let me play the amorous thief
with thy fa la, etc.
My dearest of all, why holdst thou so fast,
with a fa la, etc.
I Will swear we will marry if thou will make haste
with thy a la etc.
Cupid does give no leave to play,
Thy very blushes do betray
That thou do interpret what I have to say
with a fa la, etc.
Then on her Brow her Veil she spread,
with a fa la. etc:
As if he would been going to cut off her head
with his fa la, etc.
He with his Lips her mouth did wipe,
And gave her many an earnest gripe,
For just now my Lady was yielding ripe,
with her fa la, etc.
In what a fret was I in the tree,
with a fa la, etc.
That I had not then another by me,
with her fa la, etc.
Then I perceived they whispered awhile,
With many fair pleadings he did her beguile
Sure something he showed her which made her to smile
with a fa la, etc.
He said he was sure they could not be spyed
with a fa la, etc.
But I (if I durst) could have told him he ly'd
with his fa la, etc.
I feared I should be brought to light;
She so often cast up her eyes so bright,
The pleasure of love did so dazzle her sight,
and her fa la, etc.
My Gamster could no longer forbear,
her fa la, etc.
No more should I, if I had been there,
by her fa la, etc.
I turned and served my body round,
To see my Gallant scale the Town;
But his getting up, made me tumble down,
with a fa la, etc.
Such was my fate, no mischief I had,
with a fa la, etc.
My Lovers both run as if they would been mad,
with their fa la, etc.
And now I hope a warning 'twill be,
How they in such sinful pleasures agree,
For fear of the Devil that fell from the tr^^
with his fa la la la la la la,
