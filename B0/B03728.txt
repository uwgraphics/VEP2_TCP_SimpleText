The Huntington-shire PLOVV-MAN:
OR, The Plowmans Complain For the Loss of his Hearts Delight.
True Love alone, does cause my moan,
such Sorrows I possess;
I being left of joys bereft,
To languish in Distress.
Tune of, My Child must have a Father.
This may be Printed.

R. P.







Young Men and Maids I pray attend,
unto a Plow-Mans Ditty;
It is to you these Lines I send,
in hopes that you will pity
My sad and woeful Destiny,
I being now forsaken;
I thought she loved no man but me,
yet I was much mistaken.
I counted her my Hearts Delight,
and doated on her Beauty;
I could have served her Day and Night,
and counted it my Duty:
My Love to her I made appear,
at every time and season,
Yet I am slighted by my Dear,
and know not what is the reason.
Except the meaness of my state,
does cause her to refuse me;
But if the truth I may relate,
she ought not to abuse me:
And hold my Person thus in scorn,
in giving the denial;
For though I am a Plowman Born,
my Heart is true and Loyal.




No rest or quiet could I find,
my Love is out of measure;
She still was running in my mind,
I counted her my Treasure:
But yet at me she still would scoff,
instructed by her Mother,
And at the length did leave me off,
and Married with another.
I count this proved my Overthrow,
by being far asunder,
So that I daily could not go,
therefore I now lie under
The sense of sorrow, care and grief,
which I am still possessing,
And never expect to have relief,
or to enjoy the blessing.
Though she by Letters knew my mind.
which I was often sending,
Yet now I find her most unkind,
my Grief is without ending:
In Chains of Love I here must lie,
in Care and Grief surrounded;
Alas! I freely now could dye,
for why my Heart is wounded.
But though you thus do torture me,
as I too well do know it,
I must and will your Captive be,
for I cannot foregoe it:
Therefore always, I Will write thy praise,
in this my lovesick Story*
For I am Will the Plowman still,
and will set forth thy Glory.
She had been true to Cupids Laws,
and never coy nor cruel:
Had not her Mother been the cause,
I had enjoyed my Jewel:
On Wealth her Mothers mind was bent,
she greeded out of measure,
But Love will last when Money's spent.
then who would Wed for Treasure?
Young Men that hear me now this day,
which have a mind to Marry;
Pray do not linger and delay,
there is danger if you tarry:
When e're you understand and find,
that others are about her,
Pray take her while she is in the mind,
for fear you go without her.
