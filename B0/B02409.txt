The Counterfeit Court Lady: OR, An Answer to, Your Humble Servant Madam.
Discovering all her cunning Knacks and feats,
How wittily she does bestow her Cheats:
By which she does much admiration gain,
And in a splendid Garb her self maintain.
To the Tune of, Your Humble servant Madam.


I A am a Lass
That does surpass,
the beauties of the City;
And near the Court,
Where Blades resort,
i am counted wondrous witty:
I have an oily Tongue,
And very well it is hung,
if that you will believe me;
Your flattering disease,
My humor cannot please,
for there is none that can deceive me
No vapouring Cheat,
Shall do the feat,
with such a Girl as I am;
I Will sit and smile,
And him beguile,
and all his Oaths defy 'um:
He that will cog and lie,
Gains not my company,
when once his plot I faddam;
For I scorn that any man,
Should ever me trappan,
with your humble servant Madam.
The Second Part,
To the same Tune.
AT my first Rise,
I was so wise,
to gain a great man's favor;
And by my art,
I won his heart,
all by my brisk behavior:
Where I had Gold at will,
My mind for to fulfill,
he willing was to grant it;
But though that he is gone,
And I am left alone,
I never fear to want it.
My Rich attire,
Made all admire,
and by what means I gained it;
I have a knack,
To drink good Sack,
and bravely to maintain it;
With my Pearl about my neck,
And my Gallants at a beck,
I used to drein their Purses;
Before they will not grant,
Whatever I do want,
they will sell both Coach and Horses.
To train up youth,
I speak the truth,
upon my Reputation;
I do excel,
And do it well,
as any in the Nation:
If I may gain their gold,
I Will make them free and bold,
there is none that shall outvie them,
For all the art of Love,
You shall of them approve,
when e're you please to try them.
Young Ladies they
Observe my way,
they think I am a neat one;
If I do glance,
Or Sing, or Dance,
I am a most complete one.
Though my breeding was not great,
Yet I have learnt the feat,
for to delude a Sinner;
To sit upon his Lap,
And catch him in a trap,
for I am no young beginner.
How happy he
Is thought to be,
that by his comely carriage,
Has got the Art,
To win my heart,
and treat with me of Marriage:
When I seem to comply,
He knows no reason why,
but that he may believe me;
Thus I get Diamond Rings,
And many pretty things,
for none could e're deceive me.
Thus with my wit,
Great benefit,
and Riches I have gotten;
Which I in store,
Keep for the Poor,
when I am dead and rotten:
He shall be paid full well,
That Rings my Passing Bell,
and digs my Grave a fadam,
Then all that can be said,
Here lies one Buried,
that was a Ranting Madam.
