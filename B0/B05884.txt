The Slighted MAID: OR, The Pining Lover:
With sighs and moans she does entreat her Dear,
Whilst he seems to be deaf and will not hear:
At length his frozen Heart begins to melt,
Being moved with the passion she had felt.
To the Tune of, I prithee Love turn me, etc.
Licensed and Entered according to Order.





WAs ever Maiden so scorned,
by one that she loved so dear;
Long time have I sighed and mourned,
and still my Love will not hear:
O turn to me my own dear Heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me;
For thou art the Lad I long for,
and, alas! what remedy?
My lodging is on the cold ground,
and very hard is my fare,
But that which troubles me most, is
the unkindness of my Dear:
O turn to me my own dear Heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me;
For thou act the Lad I long for,
and, alas! what remedy?
O stop not thy ear to the wailings
of me a poor harmless Maid;
You know we are subject to failings,
blind Cupid has me betrayed:
And now I must cry, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
How can thou be so heard hearted,
and cruel to me alone;
If ever we should be parted,
then all my delight is gone;
But ever I cry, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
I Will make thee pretty sweet posies,
and constant I ever will prove,
I Will strew thy chamber with roses,
and all to delight my Love:
Then turn to me my own dear Heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone can
procure my liberty.
I Will do my endeavor to please thee,
by making the bed full soft,
Of all thy sorrows i will ease thee,
by kissing thy lips full often:
Then turn to me my own dear Heart,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone can
procure my liberty.
But thou will harden thy heart still,
and be deaf to my pitiful moan,
So I must endure the smart still,
and tumble in straw all alone:
Whilst still I cry, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
If that thou still do disdain me,
I never will love thee more,
Thy cruelty shall never pain me,
for i will have another in store:
But still I cry, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone art
the cause of my misery.
By hearing her pitiful clamor,
the passion of love he felt;
He could no longer disdain her,
his frozen heart it did melt:
For ever she cried, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone can
procure my liberty.
He said, My Love I will please thee,
thy heaviness grieves me sore,
But let not sorrow once seize thee,
I never will grieve thee more:
I Will turn to thee my own kind Heart,
dear Love i will turn to thee;
For I am the Man that now am come
to procure thy liberty.
I Will crown thee with a garland of straw then,
and marry thee with a rush-ring,
My frozen heart it will thaw then,
and merrily we will sing:
But ever she cried, O turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me,
For thou art the Man that alone can
release my misery.
Most lovingly he embraced her,
and called her his Heart's Delight;
And close by his side he placed her,
all sorrows was vanquished quite:
And now she for joy cried, Turn Love,
and I prithee Love turn to me;
For thou art the Man that alone have
releast me of misery.
