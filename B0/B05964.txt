AN ELEGY On that Faithful and Laborious Minister of Christ, Mr FRANCIS
BAMPFIELD, Who Died in Newgate on the Sabbath Day, vulg. Februar. 16th. 1683/4.
Being in the 70th. Year of His Age. 5. March. 1684/5
Wrapped in her mourning Weed, my grieved Muse,
To tune such heavy Notes, at first refused;
Rather desiring to effund her Tears
In secret, where no man nor sees, nor hears:
Till second Thoughts, Thoughts on so Worthy a Name,
With greater Energy and Power came,
And made her Tears in slow-paced Numbers fall.
To Sprinkle the Lugubrious Funeral.
Come skilful Mourners with sad Harmony
Embalm a Saints thrice Blessed Memory
With sighing Songs and mournful Melody;
In doleful Lines your pressing grief make known
Lines, stopped with sighs, and accented with groans,
Your watery eyes to streaming Riv'lets turn,
And bath with pious Tears his silent Urn;
That being impregnate with such Fertile showers,
It may at length produce some fragrant flowers,
Which may with Nature's Tap'stry cloth his Tomb,
And to all generations yet to come,
Convey an odoriferous Perfume,
While Brass and Marble Monuments consume.
Those Lips that Milk and Honey did distill,
And with sweet Balm our wounded Souls did fill,
Whence purest Eloquence did flow; Behold
How wan they are, appal'd with stupid Cold.
Those suppliant Palms that Faith did elevate
So often to reach The Eternal Mercy-Seat;
And often returned with bounteous Grace repleat,
Are now of Sense and Motion quite bereft,
And nothing but their languid Form is left:
Those Eyes wherein we saw Graces Divine
With Reverend Gravity so lively shine,
That often did steep our Sins with precious Rain,
Are now with sable clouds of Death bestain'd;
That lovely Countenance, that gracious Face,
Which Nature with sweet Lineaments did grace,
And Grace refined; which to Beholders preached,
And did with charming aspects Virtue teach,
Lo now what see we there, but Death alone,
Sitting in Triumph on his Pallid Throne!
Help LORD, thou have imposed a weighty Cross;
Save us, a Faithful Watchman we have lost:
A careful Shepherd thou have taken away;
Keep thou thy Lambs, or else they go astray:
Why do withdraw thy precious Stars of Light;
And lead us in the dismal Shades of Night?
Shall we Physicians want to cure our Souls?
Whilst festering Sins wound us without control;
And shall we pine for want of Living Bread?
Or shall our hungry Souls with Husks be fed?
O Heavens forbid it! Give us not Dross for Gold;
Let younger Prophets still succeed the Old:
When Fathers die, let Children still inherit
Their Fathers Virtues and Pastoral Spirit,
When our Elijah's are assumed to Heaven,
Let young Elisha's evermore be given:
If thus, O LORD, thou cut our Fir-Trees down
And lay'st our pleasant Cedars on the ground,
Where shall a Shelter for the Shrubs be found?
But since we have our Fate so long bewailed,
Let Sobs be curbed, and serious Thoughts recalled;
Whilst rapt in holy Visions we descry
The Place where Tears are wiped from every Eye,
With Faith's Perspective we may spy the Shore,
Whither our Faithful Guide is gone before;
We may on Nebo's Mount a Prospect gain,
To view the stately Hills, and goodly Plains
Of the Celestial Canaan; there we see
In Blessed Mansions Saints and Martyrs free
From servile Chains, keeping their Jubilee.
Lo! Christ his Servants home begins to call
In Anger, maugre all the Bars and Walls;
As if his Glorious Majesty disdained
That Mortals should his Messengers enchain.
Sleep then (Dear Saint) in Peace and softly Rest.
Till Christ resuscitate thy Quiet Dust,
To cloth it with immortal Beams of Light;
That with its Bright'ned Soul it may unite:
Mean while thy Soul does learn to tune the Lays
Which Angels utter in their Hymns of Praise.
An EPITAPH.
Whilst I in Pilgrimage did Sojourn here,
Reproach and Captive Bonds did still attend me;
I spent in Prison more than twice five years,
A full sev'nth part of the time my God did lend me:
But now being free of the New Jerusalem,
I Have changed my Prison for a Diadem.
