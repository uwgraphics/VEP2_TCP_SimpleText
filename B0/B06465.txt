The Vermous MAID's RESOLUTION: OR, The two Honest LOVERS.
Showing what Unconstant Men there be,
That often Deceit and ^la^tery
They Will cog, ^issemble, swear and lie,
A Harmless MAIDEN's Life to try;
To all such Lovers she will be coy
And says. My Freedom's all my Joy.
To the Tune of, I am a poor and harmless Maid, etc.


In a melancholy passion I
was walking (...) side,
A gallant Damsel I did say,
a lute the ha lay by her side,
Which up she took and did sing and play,
That in her freedom was all her joy,
O in my freedom's all my joy.

Alluring baits also they have,
as silver bodkins, gloves, and rings,
Which girdles, features, and jewels brave,

But those silver hooks shall never destro

Whatsoever they give, talk, or ^an,

And thus she did conclude her Song,
which having done, I up did rise,
My heart was struck with love so strong,
her beauty dazzled does mine eyes,

When she espied me where I was,
she rose and would no longer stay,
I srept unto then, because
my heart she bore with her away:
Fair Maid, said I, do not destroy

You have my heart, O be not coy,

Your freedom (...) not destroy,
For in your love is all my joy.
with that she took me by the hand,
and led me (...) by the river side,
If that you (...) and (...),

Then (...) did sing and play,
Be constant, and all be the joy.
I then made bold to crave a kiss,
which modestly she to me gave.
I took it for a heavenly bliss,
her comely ^^ure was so brave:
I thought it long to see the day,
Wherein I might my Love enjoy.
