The Soldier his Salutation to the wary Wench of Worcester.
Who kindly entreats her to grant him a kiss,
Also her Denial, in answer to this.
To a pleasant Scottish Tune, called Lowdens Delight.


FAir Venus, I admire
the power of thy Son,
No sooner to give fire
but straight the day is won.
He Will undertake the God of war to tame,
If against his bosom right he aim,
Folly were it to resist the flame
wherein I Cry
Sweet Lady pity
My mournful Ditty
do not deny
To kiss thy captive Soldier
Or else for grief I dye.
I Will change my coat and colors,
to go along with thee:
No more of Mars his followers
hence forwards will I be
I am ever bound to be thy slave
Till thou grants to me the thing I crave
It Is thy favor I desire to have
then cure my pain
Oh now or never,
Else captive ever
shall I remain,
My heart is deeply wounded
But yet I am not slain.
How can thou chase but fancy
a Soldier so complete?
whose fortunes may advance thee
and make thy honor great
I pray thee do not then so cruel prove,
For my heart I cannot yet remove,
More thou hates, the more I Am bound to love,
thine I am still
Oh fie on Cupid,
Which made me stupid
for want of skill
I now must be contented,
To serve thee at thy will.
In truth I know no reason
but I may be so bold
To kiss that lovely Prison
which keeps my heart in hold.
More cruel than a Jailer would she be
That denies me of my liberty.
If a kiss or two would set me free
or ease my smart
Do not absent thee
Nor thus torment me,
since that thou art
The Prison and the Keeper,
Of my imprisoned heart.
The second part,
to the same Tune.




Come, come, do not refuse it,
but let us now embrace
For once and do not use it
none sees us in this place
It Is in thy power, with a smile or frown
For to raise me up or cast me down:
Let thy penalty on me be known,
be it weal or woe
Come kill or cure
What I endure
no man does know,
And then farewell for ever,
My friend, or cruel foe.
Farewell, there is no duty
nor service due to me
Then tell her not of beauty
where none is placed you see.
Do not then on Cupid thus complain
Unto her that cannot ease thy pain,
Neither will I be of Venus train
I am afraid
Thou do but flatter
Faith no such matter,
shall me persuade
I will not kiss a Soldier
Lest that I be betrayed
Change not thy coat nor colors
to tarry hear with me
Good Soldiers by their Valors,
will first approved be
Never say thou art a slave of mine
Nor any thing I have of thine,
Rather shall thou dig the grave of mine
here in this place
Ere thou shall woo me
So to undo me,
fie it is base
To bring poor Country Lasses
Unto such foul disgrace.
In London you have plenty,
why would you come away?
I warrant you there is twenty
would never say you nay.
If to them thou will not constant be,
When another thou dolt chance to see
Thy affection soon will glance from me
and further range
Men once removers,
Then constant Lovers
it is most strange.
To find a faithful Soldier
Not subject unto change.
Why cal'st thou me thy prison
or Gaolor which am none?
If that be all the reason
I pray thee now be gone.
For there is no harbor in my breast
To be granted to so bold a guest
Neither will I yield to thy request
therefore in vain
Is thy intrusion
By no delusion
thou shall obtain
From me thy fond desire
My honor so to stain.
Go, go or else for bear me
faith I will never yield,
Thy captain he will cashier thee
haste haste into the field,
Least thy absence breed thee more disgrace
By thy doting on a maiden face
For the losing of thy Soldiers place
would be a shame
Haste now or never
Else Coward ever
they will thee proclaim.
To loose so great an honor
By following Venus Game.
FINIS.
