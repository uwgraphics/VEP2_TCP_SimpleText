The Dumb Lady; Or, No, no, not I; I Will Answer.
To the Tune of, the Doubtful Virgin, or the new Borey; or Will you be a Man of
Fashion.




UNderneath a little Mountain
where I used my self to walk,
By a pretty pleasant Fountain
there I heard two Lovers talk
^ay! said he my only Jewel,
would you have your Lover dye,
Can you be so fare and cruel
no indeed quoth she not I,
Why my dear my pretty Nancy,
will you then torment my mind?
If poor Willy you can fancy
show your self him more kind.
Or if you design my Ruin,
I am willing for to dye
But be short in my undoing
Still she answered no not I.
Why then pray will you torment me
and take pleasure in my smart,
When a kind look will content me
will you frown to break my Heart,
If it he my Nanny's Pleasure
on my Sword I Will freely die,
Give the word my only Treasure
Still she answered no not I.




Bid me live and I Will endeavor,
every way to gain your Love
If this be to great a Favor,
bid me from your eyes remove
Deal with me as with a Creature
as you please shall live or die
Are you Mistress of ill Nature,
Still she answered no not I.
This indeed was more contenting,
than what e're before she gave
Tho it was not full consenting
it encouraged her Flame.
Should I tempt to kiss my fair one
would you say despair and die,
Say my Love my only dear one
Still she answered no not I.
Then he laid his Arms, about her
she the Posture did Approve,
He resolved no more to doubt her
and by progress of his Love
Gained such conquest straight upon her
that at last they swain cry
Will you yield the Fort of Honor
Still she answered no not I.
But their was so little distance
and so yielding a defense
That he found all her resistance
was but only complesence,
Now said he you must surrender
if I force you will cry?
All she said fo: to defend her
Was indeed my dear not I.
Hard it was at the first Sally
for to say which side would beat,
Tho poor Willey often did Rally
he as often did retreat:
But what most deserved my wonder
Willey he for all his Art,
Tho he kept your Nanny under
was the first desired to part.
