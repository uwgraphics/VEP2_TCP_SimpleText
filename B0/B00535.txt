A new Ballad of the Soldier and Peggy
To a new Northern Tune.




IT was a brave Soldier
that long lived in wars,
He would into England,
to try his affairs,
A brave gallant Creature,
enchanted his eye:
It is for thy love Peggy,
I dye, I dye.
She had a good Husband
that loved Her well,
For Gold and for money,
none did her excel.
Yet Peggy would listen
to the Soldiers cry,
It is for thy love Peggy,
I dye, I dye.
O pretty Peggy,
let sorrows remove,
And grant me a kiss
in token of love:
O take thee a thousand,
on's but a few,
I Will leave my own husband,
to travel with you.
O pretty Peggy,
if thou will be mine,
All the gold that I get,
it shall be thine:
Father and Mother,
thouse never so mere,
If thou will go over Sea
with a Soldier.
She took the keys from her side,
to her chest she is gone,
All the gold that she has,
with her she'ath taken:
She left the Babe Motherlesse,
and the bed bare,
And she is gone over sea
with a Soldier.
As Peggy and the Soldier,
went over a plain,
He twinked at her,
she smiled again:
He courted her bravely,
as Young men should do,
And ever said Peggy,
I love none but you.
As Peggy went up the street,
so did she down,
All that did meet her
asked whither she was bound:
She answered them quickly,
she could not tell where,
For she must go ever sea
with a soldier.
Her Husband came home
so late in the night,
He asked for Peggy
his joy and delight,
They answer him quickly,
they could not tell where,
For she was gone over sea
with a Soldier.
The second part,
to the same Tune.




HE sadled his horse
and rode to the shore,
Thinking to take Peggy,
before she got ore:
He asked for Peggy,
but she was not there,
For she was gone over sea,
with a Soldier.
I pray thee good nurse
be good to my child,
And thouse have thy wages,
at every months end:
Thouse nether want money,
wine nor good cheer,
Though Peggy be over sea,
with a Soldier.
He cursed the Carpenter
that made the ship,
And eke the Plummer,
for plumming so deep:
He banned the wind
and the water so clear,
That carried her over sea
with a soldier
She had not been over sea,
passing months three,
Ere she would come home again,
if it might be,
To speak with her husband,
this matter to clear,
Because she had bin over sea
with a soldier.
This wanton lewd woman,
is come home again,
When all her pleasure,
and coin it was spent:
She could no longer,
in Ireland stay,
For she had no gold
nor money to pay.
I pray you sweet husband,
will you forgive me,
And all that is amiss,
amended shall be:
I Will live with my husband,
and Babie so dear,
And I Will never go, again,
with a soldier.
Come hither sweet Peggy,
thou art welcome to me,
So all that is amiss
amended may be.
I pray God forgive my sins,
and I Will forgive thee,
If thou'l live at home,
with thy Babie and me.
All you good wives,
that hear this my song,
Live at home with your husbands
and do them no wrong:
For youth it is wanton,
and will have a fling,
And Peggy is at home
with her husband again.
And thus of my song,
I will make an end,
Praying for Gods favor,
for women and men,
Desiring them all
in their Country to stay,
And never to wander
so vainly away
FINIS.
Printed at London for F. Coules dwelling in the Old Bailey.
