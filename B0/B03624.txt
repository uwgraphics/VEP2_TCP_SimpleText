Fancies Phoenix. O^ The Peerless Paragon of the Times.
Being a young Gallants description of a Lady which he has settled his
thoughts on, resolving never to change, nor to love any other beauty or face in
the World.

And is persuaded if there be,
A Phoenix in the world, it is she.
To an Amorous new Tune.


COme all you Batchelors so brave,
that spend your time in Cupids court
And with your Complements do crave,
with many Ladies for to sport
I am contrary to your mind
I Court but one and she is unkind.
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be
a Phoenix in the world, it is she.
I must confess I am in Love
although I thought I never should
But sure she was sent from above
and made of Natures chiefest mould
So pure, so fair, and all Divine
I Will quit the world to make her mine,
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be, etc.
I little thought I ever could
by any beauty ere be won
Nor can I now if that I would
remove my mind on any one
No wealth, no beauty, nor no face
my fixed thoughts from her displace,
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be, etc.
Do you not see the Stars retreat
when Sol salutes the sky so clear
So must all beauties never so great
shrink and withdraw when she appear
So bright, so clear that all must say
it is fair Roselia claims the day
She Is virtuous, chaste and if there be, etc.
Her bashful Cheeks with blushing sweet
casts such a rich vermilion dye
That Rose and Lilly there does meet
each striving for the victory
So rare, so pure, you will scarce believe
dame Nature could such colors give
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be, etc.
Her Eyes like sparks of Diamonds clear
such glances casts in modest sort
No wantonness in them appear
yet Cupid sure th^re keep his Court
'Twas from her eyes he shot his dart
that thus has peirc't my lovesick heart
She Is virtuous, chaste, and if there be
a Phoenix in the world, it is she.
The second part
to the same Tune




But say my Muse, what need have I
to praise her beauty in such sort
When as her fame abroad does fly
more than I can of her report
Were she to me as kind as fair
then might I live and not despair;
But sure I think if that there be
a Phoenix in the world, it is she,
For she desires to be alone
and never to participate
Her love she says to any one,
but single live without a mate
Such thoughts I think in few remain
yet does in her, the more's my pain
Then sure I think if that there be, etc.
Cruel she is to none I hear
no more she is not unto me
Nor proud she is not that is rare
you will say in women for to be
She Is courteous, lovely chaste and fair
it is few that can with her compare,
For sure I think if that there be, etc.
Then if she Phenix-like will live
and dye alone I am content
My heart to her I Will freely give
unto no other I Will consent
But in her flames my heart shall burn
and Phenix-like to ashes turn
For it is her and none but she
by whom I must revived be.
And if she will not yield at last
but still her resolutions hold
I will not think my time ill spent
nor yet my love shall near wax cold
To stay for such a one as she
I think no time there lost will be
I Would better with my fancy wed
than lodge some women in my bed.
If that you needs would know of me
whereas this Phoenix does abide
For that I must excused be
yet near the Strand she does reside,
No other notice will I give
to any one whilst I do live,
And if she does a Phoenix dye
look in her ashes there am I.
You roving Batchelors that be
resolved for to spend your time
In several Maidens company
when as their beauty are in prime
Beware, beware, let virtue guide
thee to a Maid to make thy Bride
Let not her beauty tempt your eye
least virtue too in her you spy.
I must depart time calls away
I cannot now express my mind
This Song is long enough you will say
unless that she did prove more kind
She Is virtuous, cast, and therefore I
resolve to love her till I dye;
For sure I think if that there be
a Phoenix in the world, it is she.
