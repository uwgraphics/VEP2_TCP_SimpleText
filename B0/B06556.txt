The heavy Heart, and a light Purse.
Being the good fellows vindication to all his fellow Companions, wishing them
all to have a care, and keep out of the Ale-wives snare, for when they are out
you may get in, but when you are in, you cannot get out, this by experience he
has found true, but now he bids them all adieu.

Tune of, My Lord Monks March to London, or, Now we have our freedom, etc.
This Song it was composed and made
By a Loyal heart that is called John Wade.


FVll fifty Winters have I seen,
yet nine and forty too many,
Except that I had better been,
and not spent my means so vainly:
Far I did rore and spend my store,
no company could shun me,
But now I find, and bear in mind,
my kind heart has undone me.
Once I had means, and lived well,
my neighbors all they know it,
But by the ringing of the Ale-wives bell,
I quickly did forgo it.
My Land I sold for silver and gold,
they then so easily won me,
Which makes me say, as well I may
(...)
My Wife she would me entreat
for to be more wiser;
Then I told her with anger great,
it is rare to be a Miser,
Hang it (quoth I) let money fly,
sorrow shall never o'rerun me;
But now I see, I was so free,
that my kind heart has undone me.
Before i would give one penny to my wife,
i would spend two with my fellows;
My children must fast, which bred much strife,
whilst I sat in the Alehouse;
Whilst I drank sack, they small beer did lack,
no grief could overrun me,
They lived in want whilst I did rant
(...)
SO long as I had store of coin,
i would never leave my ranting,
Whilst I did with good fellows join,
my wife she sat a wanting.
Though they did cry, yet what cared I,
sorrow should never o'rerun me,
Let who would call, i would pay for all,
till my kind heart had undone me.
Here would I trust, there would I lend,
and spend my money vainly,
For strong liquor I often would send,
now I must tell you plainly.
My children they would to me pray,
Good Father let company shun ye,
Yet i would not spare, nor for them care,
till my kind heart had undone me,
I had good House, I had good Land,
and lived in good behavior,
But I spent it all at their command
now jeers me for my labor.
My Hostis she woald wait on me,
my Host then easily won me,
Cause they did see that I was free
till my kind heart had undone me.
Run Tap, run Tapster, I would cry,
hang sorrow let us be merry,
My gold and silver I let fly
in both White Wind and Sherry,
For my own part, I never will start,
no company will shun me,
Good fellows all I in would call
till my kind heart had undone me.
My Hostis she would still provide
for me Larks, Chickens and Cony;
To bed at night she would me guide,
but 'twas for the sake of my money,
She would mehap, my head would cap,
th^^ by their tricks they won me,
Thus with a pin they drew me in,
till my kind heart had undone me.
My Hostis she was very wise,
if that my head grew adle,
IN the morn as soon as I could rise
she would provide me a Caudel
Then comes my Host strait with a Toast,
saying boy i will not shun thee,
Thus by their wile, they me beguile,
till my kind heart has undone me.
But when that I no money had,
to call I could not leave it,
To be rid of me then they was glad,
at last they did perceive it.
Then where I spent and money lent,
they strait began to shun me,
My Hostis Brown began to frown,
when my kind heart has undone me.
I sent my child thought to prevail,
a shilling for to borrow,
Or else to trust me two quarts of Ale,
lo thus began my sorrow,
She Would send me none, bid her be gone,
thus grief did overrun me,
Full forty pound with her I drowned,
till my kind heart has undone me.
So by that means I strait grew wise,
and quickly left my ranting,
You Will say 'twas time to be precise,
when every thing was wanting.
For I scarce had to buy me bread,
grief did so overrun me,
They did not care though poor I were
when my kind heart had undone me.
Now I wish good fellows every one
in time for to be ruled,
Let Ale wifes sing a mournful Song,
and never by them be fooled.
You that do spend in time amend,
before grief overrun ye,
Those that do rant in time may want,
for my kind heart has undone me.
If I had but half that I spent in vain,
methinks I should live bravely,
For I lived once and paid no rent,
though now I am bound to slavery,
For I am poor, turned out of door,
grief does so overrun me,
So farewell all, both great and small,
(...)
