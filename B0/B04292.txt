The Last Lamentation OF THE Languishing Squire: OR, Love Overcomes all Things.
To the Tune of Billyand Molly: Or, Jockey's Jealousy.
Licensed according to Order.





AS I went forth to view the Spring,
which Flora had Adorned,
In gorgeous Raiment every thing,
a Winters rage out-scorned;
I cast mine Eye and did espy
a Youth, that made great Clamor,
And drawing nigh, I heard him cry,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
Upon his Face he lay along,
hard by a Crystal River,
And mournfully his doleful Song,
with sighs he did deliver;
Woe worth her Face, her comely Grace,
for which no man can shun her,
Her splendid Rays cuts off my days,
for Omnia vincit Amor.




Her Crystal Eyes like Comets fair,
bright Phoebus Beams out-shining,
Has caught my Heart in Cupid's Snare,
and makes my dye with pining;
Fond foolish Nature did not well,
so curiously to frame her,
Her Beauty fair makes me despair,
cry Omnia vincit Amor.
You Crystal Streams that sweetly glide,
he Partners of my Mourning,
You fragrant Fields and Meadows wide,
condemn her for her scorning;
Let every Tree a Witness be,
how justly I may blame her,
You chanting Birds, note these my Words,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
I sigh and languish for her sake,
ten thousand Griefs are growing,
My fainting Heart I find will break,
while dying Tears are flowing;
Here do I find her most unkind,
therefore I needs must blame her,
Her Beauty bright destroys me quite,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
Love Conquers more than Sword or S(...)
or any Warlike Power;
Renowned Kings are forced to yield,
no strong Defenced Tower
Can ever withstand Love's armed Band
and now I here must name her,
Fair Cynthia she has ruined me,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
Had she been kind as she is fair,
she might have been admired,
In every place without compare,
who has my Death conspired.
This said, his breath began to fail,
he could not ^^^^k but stammer,
Ae sighted sore, (...) said no more,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
Thus I perceived him near his Death,
and ran in haste to save him,
But quickly he resigned his Breath,
so deep a VVound Love gave him;
Thus for his sake, this Vow I Will make
my Tungue shall still Defame her,
Upon his Hearse, I Will write this Verse,
it is Omnia vincit Amor.
