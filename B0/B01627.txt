SOLOMON's SONG,

Chap. I.
Verse 1.
THe Song of Songs
Which is King Solomon's.
2
Let him with Kisses of his mouth me Kiss,
For that thy love than Wine far better is.
3
Because the Savor and the fragrant Smell
Of thy good Ointments others that excel,
Thy name is as an Ointment forth that is poured,
Therefore the Virgins Love to thee afford.
4
Draw me we will run after thee; the King,
Has brought me to his Chambers; we will sing
Be glad, and joy in Thee: They Love we will
Mind more than Wine: The Upright love Thee still.
5
Though I am black, yet I most comely am,
(O ye the Daughters of Jerusalem)
Like to the Tents that Kedar Fields are on,
Or like the Curtains of King Solomon.
6
Look not upon the Blackness of my Hue,
Because the Sun does very often me view,
My Mothers Children angry were and hot,
To keep the Vineyards made it be my Lot,
Yet my own Vineyard I have kept not.
7
Tell me, O thou, whom my Soul loves alone,
Where thou do Feed, where thy Flocks rest at noon;
For why should I thus turned be aside,
By the flocks of thy companions to abide?
8
If thou know not, O thou the fairest Dame
Among thy Sex, turn thou thy way amain,
By the Footsteps of the Flocks, and so abide,
Feeding thy Kids, the shepherds Tents beside.
9
O thou my Love, I have compared thee,
To Horses that in Pharaoh's Chariots be.
10
Thy comely Cheeks like Jewels in a row,
With Chains of Gold thy Neck's adorned too.
11
To thee we'll Borders make of beaten Gold
With studs of Silver of the finest Mold.
12
While that the King is sitting at his Board
My Spikenard does a pleasant Smell afford.
13
A bundle of Myrrh my well belov'd's to me.
He all the Night betwixt my Breasts shall be.
14
And my Beloved is as a Cluster fair
Of Camphire in Engedi's Vineyards rare.
15
Behold you are fair, behold you are fair my Love,
Thy eyes appear like to those of a Dove.
16
Behold you are fair and comely to be seen:
O thou my Love: our Bed is also green.
17
Our House it is Beams are of the Cedar-Tree,
Our Rafters of the Fir composed be.
CHAP. II.
Verse 1.
I am the Rose of Sharon, and I am
The Lilly of the Valleys; I Am the same.
2
Even as the Lilly is among the Thorn,
So is my Love among Daughters that are born.
3
As the Apple Tree among Trees of the Wood
So among the Sons appears my Beloved;
I under's shade with great delight did rest.
His Fruit it was then pleasant to my Taste.
4
Unto the banquet house he did me move,
And over me he spread his banner love.
5
With flaggons stay, with Apples comfort me;
For I am sick of Love exceedingly.
6
Under my Head his left Hand he does place,
And his right Hand does often me embrace.
7
I charge you Daughters of Jerusalem,
By the Roes and Hynds of the field, I say by them*
That for to stir, or 'wake my love, you cease,
Until the time my welbeloved please.
8
The Voice of my beloved! lo! He comes leaping
Upon the Mountains, on the Hills comes skipping.
9
My Love is like a young Heart or a Roe:
And he behind our Wall is standing: lo,
Out at the Windows he looks forth to view,
And through the Lattess He himself does show.
10
My welbeloved spoke to me; did say,
Rise up my love, my fair one, come away.
11
For lo the Winter's past, the Rain is over,
And gone away; beloved, do not hover.
12
The Flowers upon the Earth appearing stand,
The singing of the Birds is now at hand,
The Turtle's Voice is heard within our land.
13
From the fig tree her green figgs sprout and swell'
The Vine with tender Grapes gives a good Smell.
Arise, make have, my love, and come away,
O my fair one, arise, and make no stay.
14
My Dove! that in the in Clefts o'th'Rocks abid'ft;
In secret places of the Stairs resid'st,
O let me see thy Face, and thy Voice hear,
Thy Voice is sweet, thy Countenance is fair.
15
Our Vines have tender Grapes: now therefore, go,
Take us the Foxes, little Foxes too,
That hurt the fruitful Vines, and spoil them so.
16
My well beloved is mine, and I am his;
Among the Lillies fair his feeding is.
17
Until the day do break and shadows fly;
O my beloved turn to me, and be
Like to a young Heart, or like to a Roe
Skipping on Bether's mountains to and fro.
CHAP. III.
Verse 1.
BY Night, on Bed, whom my Soul loves I sought
I sought Him, but alas! I found Him not.
2
I will rise now, and round the city go;
And in the streets, and broad ways to and fro',
Whom my Soul loves I Will seek with my whole mind.
I sought him but no ways I could him find
3
The Watchmen that did walk the City round,
Although I found him not, yet me they found;
To whom I said; Ho watchmen! did you see
Him whom my very Soul loves ferventlie?
4
It Was but a little I from them was gone,
When I found him my Soul was set upon;
I held him, but I would not let him go,
Till that I had conducted him into
My Mothers House, and to the very Room
Of her that first conceav'd me in her Womb.
5
I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem,
By the Roes, and by the Hinds, I say by them,
That for to stir, or 'wake my Love you cease,
Until the time my welbeloved please.
6
Who Is this that from the wilderness does stir
Like smoaky Pillars, all perfumed with Myrrh
And Frankincense, with all the Powders rare
That brought unto us by the Merchants are?
7
Behold! three score of Isr'els Valiant Ones
Do guard the Bed which is King Solomon's.
8
They all hold Swords, in war expert; for why?
Each man a Sword has girt upon his Thigh,
Lest dangers of the night should terrify.
9
A Bed, or Chariot; King Solomon
Made to Himself, o'th'Wood of Lebanon.
10
Whereof the Pillars were of silver mold,
The Bottom also it was made of Gold;
The Cover Purple; the midst paved with Love
For th'Daughters of Jerusalems Behove.
11
Go, Zions Daughters, See King Solomon
With His Crown, that Crown his Mother put upon
His Head, that day he his Espousals had;
And in the day wherein his heart was Glad.
CHAP. IV.
Verse 1.
BEhold, you are fair, behold, thourt fair, my love,
Within thy locks thou have eyes of a Dove;
And as a Flock of Goats that do appear
From the Mount Gilead: So does thy Hair.
2
Thy Teeth are like unto a Flock of Sheep
Even shorn, and comeing from the waters deep,
Each one whereof bears twins, and there is none
Among them barren; not so much as one.
3
Thy Lips like to a Scarlet thread appear,
Thy Speech is comely; pleasant to mine Ear.
Within thy Locks, thy Temples they are set
Even like unto a piece of Pomegranate.
4
Thy Neck is like King David's Tower, which He
Built for an Armoury, whereon there be
A Thousand Bucklers hanging, fit for War;
All shields of men that strong and mighty are.
5
Thy Breasts like two Young twin Roes do appear,
Both which among the Lillies feeding are.
6
Till the day break and shaddows flee; from hence
I Will get me to the mounts of Myrrh, and thence,
Will also go to th'Hill of Frankincense.
7
My love thour't fair and comely for to see,
No Spot or Blemish is at all in thee.
8
With me from Lebanon, my Spouse came up,
With me from Lebanon; look from the Top
Of Shenir, Hermon; Amana also,
The Lions Denns, and Le'pards Mountains too.
9
Thou'st ravished my Heart within my Breast
My Sister, Spouse; my heart thou ravished have
With one glance of thine eye, and with one chain
Encompassing thy Neck, thou did it gain.
10
O thou my Sister, Spouse: How fair's thy love!
I do esteem and value it above
The choicest Wine; Yea and the fragrant Smell
Thy Ointments Yield, all Spices do excel.
11
As th'Hony-comb, O Spouse, drops to the ground
So are thy Lips. Honey* and Milk are found
Beneath thy tongue; thy Garments give a Smell
Which does even that of Lebanon excel.
12
Unto a Garden, fenced about and barred,
My Sister, spouse, may fitly be compared.
Like to a spring of Waters closely shut;
A Fountain whereupon a Seal is put.
13
Thy Plants, an Orchard of Pomegranats are,
With pleasant Fruits, Camphire, with Spikenard rare.
14
Spikenard and Saffron, Calamus also
And Cinamom, with all the Trees that grow
Of Frankincense, of Myrrh and Aloes
With all the Spices, and of them the choice.
15
A well of Waters that do ever run:
A Fount of Gardens; streams from Lebanon.
16
Awake O North Wind; South Wind come and blow
Upon my Garden, make the Spices flow.
Let my beloved to his Garden have,
And eat his Fruits most pleasant to his Taste.
CHAP. V.
Verse 1.
MY Sister, Spouse, I Am in my garden fair,
My Myrrh, my Spice by me now gathered are.
My Honey with my Honeycomb, also
I Have ate; My Wine, with Milk I Have drunken too;
Eat, O Beloved! Drink, and satisfy
Your selves, O Friends, Yea, drink abundantly.
2
I sleep, but yet my heart's awake. It is
The voice of my Beloved that knocks; it is his,
Thus saying: Open unto me, my Love,
My undefi'ld, My Sister, and my Dove,
For with the dew my Head's already filled
And my Locks with the drops, by night distilled.
3
I have put of my Coat, how shall I then
(Yea how shall I now) put it on again?
And having washed my Feet most carefully,
How shall I now defile them? How shall I?
4
By the hole of the Door, his hands, my Love
Put in; my Bowels then for him did move.
5
To my Beloved I rose, the Door to ope',
And then with Myrrh my very Hands did drop,
My Fingers too sweet smelling Myrrh distilled,
Which all the handles of the Lock had filled.
6
I opened to my Love, but he had withdraw'n
Himself away; and He away was gone.
My Soul failed when He did upon me call;
I sought Him, but I found Him not at all.
When I Him sought, He did no Notice take,
And when I called, He did no Answer make.
7
The Watchmen that about the City go,
Found me, as I was wandering to and fro'
They smote and wounded me, they that did watch
And keep the walls, my vail did from me snatch.
8
O Daughters of Jerusalem, I do,
Adjure You all, yea every one of You,
To tell my Love, when You him find, that I
Am sick, yea sick of Love exceedingly.
9
What Is thy Beloved more than others are?
O thou the fairest of all Women fair,
What Is thy beloved more than they? that thus
Concerning him, thou giv'st this Charge to us.
10
My welbeloved's white and ruddy, He
The Chief among tenthousands is to me.
11
His Head is as the pure and finest Gold,
His Locks are bushie, and in Curls do fold,
And black as any Raven to behold.
12
His Eyes, like Doves which by the Rivers sit,
Are washed with Milk, and also set most fit.
13
His Cheeks like to a Bed of Spices are,
And as sweet fragrant Flowrs they do appear.
His Lips like to the Lillies fair, that drop
Sweet smelling Myrrh from off their very Top.
14
As Gold Rings that with Beryls garnsht are,
So do his Hands unto my sight appear.
His Belly's as bright Ivory, arrayed
With Saphires, and with them all overlay'd.
15
His Legs, as Marble pillars I behold,
Set upon Sockets of the finest Gold;
His Countenance is like to Lebanon,
And stately Cedars growing thereupon.
16
His Mouth it is most sweet. Moreover, He
Is altogether Lovely unto me.
O Daughters of Jerusalem! This, This
My Friend; yea and my well Beloved is.
CHAP. VI.
Verse 1.
Where Is thy beloved gone? O thou most fair
Among all Women that the fairest are?
O whither is He turned aside? that we
May go along and seek thy Love with thee.
2
My well beloved's to his Garden gone,
To feed in the Gardens; and to rest upon
The Beds of Spices; and to pluck the fair
And pleasant Lilies that are growing there.
3
My well beloved's mine, and I am his
Among the Lilies fair he feeding is.
4
O thou my Love thou art exceeding fair;
For beauty, I Will to Tirzah thee compare,
Jorus'lem like, with comeliness arrayed
And terrible as Banners when displayed.
5
Thine Eyes from me O do thou tuan away,
Me vanquished and overcome have they;
And as a Flock of Goats that does appear
from the Mount Gilead; so does thy Hair.
6
Thy Teeth are like unto a Flock of Sheep,
Come up from washing in the waters deep,
Each one where of bears twins; and there is none
Among them barren; not so much as one.
7
Within thy Locks, thy Temples thy are set;
Even like unto a piece of Pomegranate.
8
There Is threescore Queens, and Concubines fourscore,
Of Virgins an innumerable Store.
9
My Dove, my Undefil'd's but one; her Mother,
That brought her forth, besides her, had no other;
The choice one too of her that did her bear;
The Virgins saw her, and they blessed her,
Yea and the Queens her maginfi'd and Praised
The Concubines her Glory also raised.
10
Who Is she that looks forth like to the Morn,
Fair as the Moon that does the night adorn,
Even as the Sun when it is shining clear,
And terrible as banners does appear?
11
I went to the Nut Garden, there to view
The fruits that in the pleasant valley grew;
To see if that the Vine had flourished;
Or Pomegranates their Buds abroad had shed.
12
Ere that I was aware, my Soul made me
lnth' Chariots of Amminadib, to be,
13
Return, return, O Shulamite, come back,
Return, that we may notice of thee take.
What is it in the Shulamite, Ye'll see?
As 'twere, of Armies two, the Company.
CHAP. VII.
Verse 1.
Thy Feet with shoes, how beautiful they are
O Princes Daughter! Yea and l'le compare
The Joints, that motion to thy Thighs impart
To Jewels, wrought by cunning Workmans Art.
2
Thy Navel's like a Goblet that is round,
And with much Precious Liquor does abound:
Thy Belly is like to an Heap of Wheat
That Is round about with fairest Liliesset.
3
And thy two Breasts may be compared unto
Two Young Roes of the Field, and Twins also.
4
Thy Neck is as a Towr of Ivory.
Thine Eyes like Fish-Pools that in Hesbonly,
Hard by Bathrabbim gate. Thy Nose alone
May be compared to th'Tow'r of Lebanon,
Damascus-ward, as looking thereupon.
5
Thy Head is like unto Mount-Carmel fair.
And like the fairest Purple is thy Hair.
The King is held in's Galleri'es, walking there.
6
How fair! how pleasant! and how far above
All others, for Delights! art thou my Love!
7
Thy Stature, to a Palm tree's like, for shape;
Thy Breasts are like to Clusters of the grape.
8
I will, said I, up to the Palm tree go,
And of it is Boughs I will take hold also:
Thy Breasts shall be as Clusters of the Vine;
And the Smell of thy Nose, like Apples fine.
9
Thy Palat's like choice Vine, which for the sake
Of my Beloved, a sweet descent does make,
Causing the Lips of those that steep, to speak.
10
I am my well Beloved's; and I see
That his Desire is always toward me.
11
Come my Beloved, to the Fields let us go,
And to the Villages; Let Us lodge there too.
12
Come, let us early to the Vineyeards get,
Let Us see if that the Vine have flourished yet,
Whither the tender Grape does yet appear,
Or if the Pomegranats yet budded are.
13
The Mandrakes do a pleasant Smell afford;
And at our Gates all Pleasant fruits are stored,
Both New and old, which I Have laid up for thee
O thou who art Beloved unto me.
CHAP. VIII.
Verse 1.
O that thou were unto me, as my Brother
That sucked the very br^ast of my dear Mother
I finding thee without, would kiss thee too
Nor should I be despised so to do;
2
Unto my Mothers House I Would thee conduct
And bring thee thither: she would me Instruct
I Would cause thee for to drink of spiced Wine,
And of the Juice of Pomgranates most fine.
3
Under my Head, his left Hand he should place
And with his Right Hand he should me embrace.
4
O Daughters of Jerusalem I do
Adjure You all, and every one of you
That for to stir, or'wake my Love you cease
Until the time my well beloved please.
5
Who Is this that comes from the Wilderness,
And leaning on her well beloved is?
There I thee raised under The Apple Tree
Ther'twas thy Mother brought thee forth Yea she
That did the bear; 'twas there I raised thee.
6
Set me, like as a Seal upon thy Heart,
And as a Seal upon thine Arm, insert.
For Love is strong as Death; and Jealousy,
Is like into the Grave for Cruelty,
It Is Coals are Coals of Fire and from the same
Proceeds a mighty and most Veh'ment flame.
7
Love cannot be by many waters quenched,
Neither can it by any floods be drench't
Yea as for Love should any man bestow
The Substance of his House, it were too low
A value to be put upon it so.
8
We have a little Sister; but, alace!
She has no breasts; when er'e it comes to pass
That she be spoken for, what shall we do
For her that day, she being stated so.
9
If that she be a wall, then on the same
We will a Palace of pure Silver frame.
And if she prove to be a door, then we
Will her enclose with Boards of Cedar Tree.
10
I am a wall, for building on most fit,
Yea and my Breasts are like the Towers of it.
Then was I even as one that he did prize,
Or one that had found favor in his Eyes,
11
At Baal-hamon, Solomon he had
A Vineyard which with fruitful Vines was clad
This Vine Yard he to Keepers did out let
Each one of them were for the Fruit of it,
Bound and obliged also for to bring
A thousand Silver pieces to the King,
12
My Vineyard which is mine, before me is;
And thou (O Solomon) must have for this
A thousand pieces, Yea and these that do
Attend it is fruit, must have two hundred too.
13
O thou that dwell in the Gardens fair
Lo, the Companions attending are
Unto thy Voice; Cause me the same to hear,
14
Make have, beloved and be like unto
A Young Heart, or be like unto a Roe
On th'Mounts of Spices skipping, to and fro.
FINIS.
